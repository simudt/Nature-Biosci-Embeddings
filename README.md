## Nature Biosciences Open Access Paper Abstracts Embeddings

Welcome to the Nature Biosciences Open Access Paper Abstracts Embeddings repository! Here in this repository, you will find a curated collection of `open access` research paper abstracts datasets specifically focused on biosciences, sourced exclusively from Nature journal publications. By gathering these datasets, repository aims to provide a open, comprehensive entrypoint embeddings for researchers, students, and enthusiasts in the biosciences field. Datasets included in this repository are solely abstracts from Nature publications in the field of biosciences.

### Embeddings

 In addition to the datasets available here, this repository houses the embedding models created using the `all-MPNet-base-v2` sentence transformer model which provides a comprehensive collection of embeddings that encode the semantic information of the data. These embeddings serve as compact numerical representations of sentences or texts, allowing for efficient similarity comparisons, clustering, and downstream applications.

 Whether you are working on natural language processing tasks, information retrieval, or machine learning applications, the embeddings in this repository will enhance your research and analysis capabilities. You can leverage them for tasks such as document similarity, text classification, question-answering, and more.

 [You can access the embeddings via HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/simudt/nature-bio-oa-abstract-embeddings)

 ### Usage

 You can use the embeddings in the Google Colab by uploading the [notebook file.](https://github.com/simudt/Nature-Biosci-Embeddings/blob/main/Nature-Bio-Embeddings-colab.ipynb)

### Legal

The information provided in this repository is collected and processed only for open-source informational purposes. While efforts have been made to ensure the collected papers have an [Open Access](https://www.springernature.com/gp/open-research/about/the-fundamentals-of-open-access-and-open-research) label. As stated in the website of Nature, "Open access (OA) refers to the free, immediate, online availability of research outputs such as journal articles or books, combined with the rights to use these outputs fully in the digital environment. OA content is open to all, with no access fees. Open research goes beyond the boundaries of publications to consider all research outputs – from data to code and even open peer review. Making all outputs of research as open and accessible as possible means research can have a greater impact, and help to solve some of the world’s greatest challenges. ... The CC BY licence is the most open licence available and considered the industry 'gold standard' for OA; it is also preferred by many funders. It lets others distribute, remix, tweak, and build upon your work, even commercially, as long as they credit you for the original creation. It offers maximum dissemination and use of licenced materials. All Springer Nature journals with OA options offer the CC BY licence, and this is now the default licence for the majority of Springer Nature fully OA journals. It is also the default license for OA books and chapters. Other Creative Commons licenses are available on request."
