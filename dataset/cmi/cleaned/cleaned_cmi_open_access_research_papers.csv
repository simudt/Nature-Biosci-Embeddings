"cmi","Roles of macrophages in tumor development: a spatiotemporal perspective","Macrophages are critical regulators of tissue homeostasis but are also abundant in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In both primary tumors and metastases, such tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) seem to support tumor development. While we know that TAMs are the dominant immune cells in the TME, their vast heterogeneity and associated functions are only just being unraveled. In this review, we outline the various known TAM populations found thus far and delineate their specialized roles associated with the main stages of cancer progression. We discuss how macrophages may prime the premetastatic niche to enable the growth of a metastasis and then how subsequent metastasis-associated macrophages can support secondary tumor growth. Finally, we speculate on the challenges that remain to be overcome in TAM research.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01061-6"
"cmi","Type 2 immunity in the brain and brain borders","Recent research in neuroimmunology has revolutionized our understanding of the intricate interactions between the immune system and the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS, an “immune-privileged organ”, is now known to be intimately connected to the immune system through different cell types and cytokines. While type 2 immune responses have traditionally been associated with allergy and parasitic infections, emerging evidence suggests that these responses also play a crucial role in CNS homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. Type 2 immunity encompasses a delicate interplay among stroma, Th2 cells, innate lymphoid type 2 cells (ILC2s), mast cells, basophils, and the cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-25, TSLP and IL-33. In this review, we discuss the beneficial and detrimental roles of type 2 immune cells and cytokines in CNS injury and homeostasis, cognition, and diseases such as tumors, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01043-8"
"cmi","Germinal center-dependent and -independent immune responses of tumor-infiltrating B cells in human cancers","B cells play essential roles in immunity, mainly through the production of high affinity plasma cells (PCs) and memory B (Bmem) cells. The affinity maturation and differentiation of B cells rely on the integration of B-cell receptor (BCR) intrinsic and extrinsic signals provided by antigen binding and the microenvironment, respectively. In recent years, tumor infiltrating B (TIL-B) cells and PCs (TIL-PCs) have been revealed as important players in antitumor responses in human cancers, but their interplay and dynamics remain largely unknown. In lymphoid organs, B-cell responses involve both germinal center (GC)-dependent and GC-independent pathways for Bmem cell and PC production. Affinity maturation of BCR repertoires occurs in GC reactions with specific spatiotemporal dynamics of signal integration by B cells. In general, the reactivation of high-affinity Bmem cells by antigens triggers GC-independent production of large numbers of PC without BCR rediversification. Understanding B-cell dynamics in immune responses requires the integration of multiple tools and readouts such as single-cell phenotyping and RNA-seq, in situ analyses, BCR repertoire analysis, BCR specificity and affinity assays, and functional tests. Here, we review how those tools have recently been applied to study TIL-B cells and TIL-PC in different types of solid tumors. We assessed the published evidence for different models of TIL-B-cell dynamics involving GC-dependent or GC-independent local responses and the resulting production of antigen-specific PCs. Altogether, we highlight the need for more integrative B-cell immunology studies to rationally investigate TIL-B cells as a leverage for antitumor therapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01060-7"
"cmi","Immunoception: the insular cortex perspective","To define the systemic neuroimmune interactions in health and disease, we recently suggested immunoception as a term that refers to the existence of bidirectional functional loops between the brain and the immune system. This concept suggests that the brain constantly monitors changes in immune activity and, in turn, can regulate the immune system to generate a physiologically synchronized response. Therefore, the brain has to represent information regarding the state of the immune system, which can occure in multiple ways. One such representation is an immunengram, a trace that is partially stored by neurons and partially by the local tissue. This review will discuss our current understanding of immunoception and immunengrams, focusing on their manifestation in a specific brain region, the insular cortex (IC).","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01051-8"
"cmi","Neutrophil diversity and plasticity: Implications for organ transplantation","Neutrophils, as the first defenders against external microbes and stimuli, are highly active and finely regulated innate immune cells. Emerging evidence has challenged the conventional dogma that neutrophils are a homogeneous population with a short lifespan that promotes tissue damage. Recent findings on neutrophil diversity and plasticity in homeostatic and disease states have centered on neutrophils in the circulation. In contrast, a comprehensive understanding of tissue-specialized neutrophils in health and disease is still lacking. This article will first discuss how multiomics advances have contributed to our understanding of neutrophil heterogeneity and diversification in resting and pathological settings. This discussion will be followed by a focus on the heterogeneity and role of neutrophils in solid organ transplantation and how neutrophils may contribute to transplant-related complications. The goal of this article is to provide an overview of the research on the involvement of neutrophils in transplantation, with the aim that this may draw attention to an underappreciated area of neutrophil research.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01058-1"
"cmi","4-1BB-4-1BBL cis-interaction contributes to the survival of self-reactive CD8+ T cell","4-1BB is an inducible receptor expressed on activated T cells, while its ligand, 4-1BBL, is mainly expressed in antigen-presenting cells and macrophages [1, 2]. To the best of our knowledge, ligand-mediated transactivation of 4-1BB is responsible for the survival and immune effector functions of T cells. However, there have been reports of 4-1BBL also being expressed in T cells [3, 4]. As 4-1BB has only one known ligand, 4-1BBL, this coexpression of 4-1BB and 4-1BBL on T cells raises questions about cis-interactions among the proteins and their potential role in T-cell activation and immune function. Therefore, to investigate whether 4-1BB and 4-1BBL signals are necessary to suppress tumor growth, we designed an experiment as shown in Fig. 1a. In vivo administration of the 3H3 clone strongly triggers 4-1BB signals along with no or minor 4-1BBL signals, TKS-1 induces a mild agonistic effect on 4-1BBL with blockade of 4-1BB signals, 17B5 blocks both 4-1BB and 4-1BBL signals, and coadministration of 3H3 and TKS-1 enhances both 4-1BB and 4-1BBL signals [5,6,7]. C57BL/6 mice received mAbs intraperitoneally every 5 days starting from 9 days after MC38 tumor injection (Fig. 1a). Compared to rat IgG treatment, 17B5 treatment did not affect the tumor growth rate, but it did increase mortality (Fig. 1b). While TKS-1 treatment alone was ineffective, the combination treatment of 3H3 and TKS-1 effectively suppressed tumor growth (Fig. 1b). The percentage and absolute number of tumor-specific pGP70+CD8+ T cells were significantly higher in the inguinal tumor-draining lymph nodes (iTDLNs) of mice treated with 3H3 alone or with TSK-1 in combination with 3H3 than in those treated with rat IgG, TKS-1, or 17B5 alone (Fig. 1c, d). The results suggest that the combination of 3H3 and TKS-1 enhances tumor-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in MC38 tumor-bearing mice.Fig. 1Anti-4-1BBL enhances 4-1BB-stimulated antitumor responses: (a) C57BL/6 mice were s.c. injected with MC38 tumor cells and i.p. administered 100 [mu]g of mAbs on the indicated days. b Tumor growth rate. c iTDLN cells were counted and stained with pGP70-PE and anti-CD8[beta]-PE-Cy5. d The absolute numbers of total and pGP70+CD8+ T cells in the inguinal TDLN were calculated. 4-1BBL promotes LN migration and tumor infiltration of activated pmel-1 CD8+ T cells: (e) Schematic diagram of the experiment. f Single-cell suspensions of inguinal LNs at Day 7 were counted and stained as described above.

"cmi","Brain macrophage development, diversity and dysregulation in health and disease","Brain macrophages include microglia in the parenchyma, border-associated macrophages in the meningeal-choroid plexus-perivascular space, and monocyte-derived macrophages that infiltrate the brain under various disease conditions. The vast heterogeneity of these cells has been elucidated over the last decade using revolutionary multiomics technologies. As such, we can now start to define these various macrophage populations according to their ontogeny and their diverse functional programs during brain development, homeostasis and disease pathogenesis. In this review, we first outline the critical roles played by brain macrophages during development and healthy aging. We then discuss how brain macrophages might undergo reprogramming and contribute to neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune diseases, and glioma. Finally, we speculate about the most recent and ongoing discoveries that are prompting translational attempts to leverage brain macrophages as prognostic markers or therapeutic targets for diseases that affect the brain.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01053-6"
"cmi","Mannosylated glycans impair normal T-cell development by reprogramming commitment and repertoire diversity","T-cell development ensures the formation of diverse repertoires of T-cell receptors (TCRs) that recognize a variety of antigens. Glycosylation is a major posttranslational modification present in virtually all cells, including T-lymphocytes, that regulates activity/functions. Although these structures are known to be involved in TCR-selection in DP thymocytes, it is unclear how glycans regulate other thymic development processes and how they influence susceptibility to disease. Here, we discovered stage-specific glycome compositions during T-cell development in human and murine thymocytes, as well as dynamic alterations. After restricting the N-glycosylation profile of thymocytes to high-mannose structures, using specific glycoengineered mice (Rag1CreMgat1fl/fl), we showed remarkable defects in key developmental checkpoints, including ß-selection, regulatory T-cell generation and [gamma][delta]T-cell development, associated with increased susceptibility to colon and kidney inflammation and infection. We further demonstrated that a single N-glycan antenna (modeled in Rag1CreMgat2fl/fl mice) is the sine-qua-non condition to ensure normal development. In conclusion, we revealed that mannosylated thymocytes lead to a dysregulation in T-cell development that is associated with inflammation susceptibility.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01052-7"
"cmi","The role of cellular and molecular neuroimmune crosstalk in gut immunity","The gastrointestinal tract is densely innervated by the peripheral nervous system and populated by the immune system. These two systems critically coordinate the sensations of and adaptations to dietary, microbial, and damaging stimuli from the external and internal microenvironment during tissue homeostasis and inflammation. The brain receives and integrates ascending sensory signals from the gut and transduces descending signals back to the gut via autonomic neurons. Neurons regulate intestinal immune responses through the action of local axon reflexes or through neuronal circuits via the gut-brain axis. This neuroimmune crosstalk is critical for gut homeostatic maintenance and disease resolution. In this review, we discuss the roles of distinct types of gut-innervating neurons in the modulation of intestinal mucosal immunity. We will focus on the molecular mechanisms governing how different immune cells respond to neural signals in host defense and inflammation. We also discuss the therapeutic potential of strategies targeting neuroimmune crosstalk for intestinal diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01054-5"
"cmi","Optimized collaboration of the first and third signals endows robust activity to T cells within the immunocompetent tumor microenvironment","CAR T-cell therapy has shown remarkable potential in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, and these successes have greatly motivated research on treatment of solid tumors. Although numerous clinical trials have been actively carried out, exciting clinical responses are still sporadic and may be are transient for patients with solid tumors [1]. Such poor antitumor potency in solid tumors has been attributed to several aspects, including the heterogeneity of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), poor trafficking of CAR T cells to the tumor site and inevitable off-tumor toxicities, as well as the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01050-9"
"cmi","A subpopulation of CD146+ macrophages enhances antitumor immunity by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome","As one of the main tumor-infiltrating immune cell types, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) determine the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, limited knowledge about their phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous nature restricts their application in tumor immunotherapy. In this study, we identified a subpopulation of CD146+ TAMs that exerted antitumor activity in both human samples and animal models. CD146 expression in TAMs was negatively controlled by STAT3 signaling. Reducing this population of TAMs promoted tumor development by facilitating myeloid-derived suppressor cell recruitment via activation of JNK signaling. Interestingly, CD146 was involved in the NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated activation of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, partially by inhibiting transmembrane protein 176B (TMEM176B), an immunoregulatory cation channel. Treatment with a TMEM176B inhibitor enhanced the antitumor activity of CD146+ TAMs. These data reveal a crucial antitumor role of CD146+ TAMs and highlight the promising immunotherapeutic approach of inhibiting CD146 and TMEM176B.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01047-4"
"cmi","Biomechanical control of lymphatic vessel physiology and functions","The ever-growing research on lymphatic biology has clearly identified lymphatic vessels as key players that maintain human health through their functional roles in tissue fluid homeostasis, immunosurveillance, lipid metabolism and inflammation. It is therefore not surprising that the list of human diseases associated with lymphatic malfunctions has grown larger, including issues beyond lymphedema, a pathology traditionally associated with lymphatic drainage insufficiency. Thus, the discovery of factors and pathways that can promote optimal lymphatic functions may offer new therapeutic options. Accumulating evidence indicates that aside from biochemical factors, biomechanical signals also regulate lymphatic vessel expansion and functions postnatally. Here, we review how mechanical forces induced by fluid shear stress affect the behavior and functions of lymphatic vessels and the mechanisms lymphatic vessels employ to sense and transduce these mechanical cues into biological signals.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01042-9"
"cmi","Macrophage phagocytosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells mediates potent plasmacytoid dendritic cell activation","Early and strong interferon type I (IFN-I) responses are usually associated with mild COVID-19 disease, whereas persistent or unregulated proinflammatory cytokine responses are associated with severe disease outcomes. Previous work suggested that monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) are resistant and unresponsive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we demonstrate that upon phagocytosis of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, MDMs are activated and secrete IL-6 and TNF. Importantly, activated MDMs in turn mediate strong activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), leading to the secretion of high levels of IFN-[alpha] and TNF. Furthermore, pDC activation promoted IL-6 production by MDMs. This kind of pDC activation was dependent on direct integrin-mediated cell‒cell contacts and involved stimulation of the TLR7 and STING signaling pathways. Overall, the present study describes a novel and potent pathway of pDC activation that is linked to the macrophage-mediated clearance of infected cells. These findings suggest that a high infection rate by SARS-CoV-2 may lead to exaggerated cytokine responses, which may contribute to tissue damage and severe disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01039-4"
"cmi","Discovery of highly immunogenic spleen-resident FCGR3+CD103+ cDC1s differentiated by IL-33-primed ST2+ basophils","Recombinant interleukin-33 (IL-33) inhibits tumor growth, but the detailed immunological mechanism is still unknown. IL-33-mediated tumor suppression did not occur in Batf3−/− mice, indicating that conventional type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1s) play a key role in IL-33-mediated antitumor immunity. A population of CD103+ cDC1s, which were barely detectable in the spleens of normal mice, increased significantly in the spleens of IL-33-treated mice. The newly emerged splenic CD103+ cDC1s were distinct from conventional splenic cDC1s based on their spleen residency, robust effector T-cell priming ability, and surface expression of FCGR3. DCs and DC precursors did not express Suppressor of Tumorigenicity 2 (ST2). However, recombinant IL-33 induced spleen-resident FCGR3+CD103+ cDC1s, which were found to be differentiated from DC precursors by bystander ST2+ immune cells. Through immune cell fractionation and depletion assays, we found that IL-33-primed ST2+ basophils play a crucial role in the development of FCGR3+CD103+ cDC1s by secreting IL-33-driven extrinsic factors. Recombinant GM-CSF also induced the population of CD103+ cDC1s, but the population neither expressed FCGR3 nor induced any discernable antitumor immunity. The population of FCGR3+CD103+ cDC1s was also generated in vitro culture of Flt3L-mediated bone marrow-derived DCs (FL-BMDCs) when IL-33 was added in a pre-DC stage of culture. FL-BMDCs generated in the presence of IL-33 (FL-33-DCs) offered more potent tumor immunotherapy than control Flt3L-BMDCs (FL-DCs). Human monocyte-derived DCs were also more immunogenic when exposed to IL-33-induced factors. Our findings suggest that recombinant IL-33 or an IL-33-mediated DC vaccine could be an attractive protocol for better tumor immunotherapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01035-8"

"cmi","Reciprocal costimulatory molecules control the activation of mucosal type 3 innate lymphoid cells during engagement with B cells","Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are the counterpart of T helper cells in the innate immune system and share multiple phenotypes with T helper cells. Inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) is recognized on T cells and participates in T-cell activation and T and B-cell engagement in lymphoid tissues. However, the role of ICOS in ILC3s and ILC3-involved interactions with the immune microenvironment remains unclear. Here, we found that ICOS expression on human ILC3s was correlated with the activated state of ILC3s. ICOS costimulation enhanced the survival, proliferation, and capacity of ILC3s to produce cytokines (IL-22, IL-17A, IFN-[gamma], TNF, and GM-CSF). Via synergistic effects of ICOS and CD40 signaling, B cells promoted ILC3 functions, and ILC3-induced T-cell-independent B-cell IgA and IgM secretion primarily required CD40 signaling. Hence, ICOS is essential for the nonredundant role of ILC3s and their interaction with adjacent B cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01041-w"
"cmi","Intricacies of TGF-[beta] signaling in Treg and Th17 cell biology","Balanced immunity is pivotal for health and homeostasis. CD4+ helper T (Th) cells are central to the balance between immune tolerance and immune rejection. Th cells adopt distinct functions to maintain tolerance and clear pathogens. Dysregulation of Th cell function often leads to maladies, including autoimmunity, inflammatory disease, cancer, and infection. Regulatory T (Treg) and Th17 cells are critical Th cell types involved in immune tolerance, homeostasis, pathogenicity, and pathogen clearance. It is therefore critical to understand how Treg and Th17 cells are regulated in health and disease. Cytokines are instrumental in directing Treg and Th17 cell function. The evolutionarily conserved TGF-[beta] (transforming growth factor-[beta]) cytokine superfamily is of particular interest because it is central to the biology of both Treg cells that are predominantly immunosuppressive and Th17 cells that can be proinflammatory, pathogenic, and immune regulatory. How TGF-[beta] superfamily members and their intricate signaling pathways regulate Treg and Th17 cell function is a question that has been intensely investigated for two decades. Here, we introduce the fundamental biology of TGF-[beta] superfamily signaling, Treg cells, and Th17 cells and discuss in detail how the TGF-[beta] superfamily contributes to Treg and Th17 cell biology through complex yet ordered and cooperative signaling networks.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01036-7"
"cmi","The chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1/CCL2 is a promoter of breast cancer metastasis","Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer worldwide, and metastasis is the leading cause of death in cancer patients. Human monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) was isolated from the culture supernatants of not only mitogen-activated peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes but also malignant glioma cells based on its in vitro chemotactic activity toward human monocytes. MCP-1 was subsequently found to be identical to a previously described tumor cell-derived chemotactic factor thought to be responsible for the accumulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and it became a candidate target of clinical intervention; however, the role of TAMs in cancer development was still controversial at the time of the discovery of MCP-1. The in vivo role of MCP-1 in cancer progression was first evaluated by examining human cancer tissues, including breast cancers. Positive correlations between the level of MCP-1 production in tumors and the degree of TAM infiltration and cancer progression were established. The contribution of MCP-1 to the growth of primary tumors and metastasis to the lung, bone, and brain was examined in mouse breast cancer models. The results of these studies strongly suggested that MCP-1 is a promoter of breast cancer metastasis to the lung and brain but not bone. Potential mechanisms of MCP-1 production in the breast cancer microenvironment have also been reported. In the present manuscript, we review studies in which the role of MCP-1 in breast cancer development and progression and the mechanisms of its production were examined and attempt to draw a consensus and discuss the potential use of MCP-1 as a biomarker for diagnosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01013-0"
"cmi","Hyaluronan as an immunological adjuvant: a novel application for an ancient molecule","Vaccines are among the most important scientific breakthroughs in human history. However, both the recent COVID-19 pandemic and cancer prevalence highlighted the requirements for new vaccination platforms that are more effective in stimulating complex immune responses, including the activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell-mediated immunity and the induction of immunological memory. In this regard, protein-/peptide-based vaccines represent valuable options that are based on a balance between a good safety profile and a relatively rapid manufacturing time; nonetheless, efficient adjuvants are needed for protein-based vaccines to overcome weak immunogenicity. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists have been advanced as promising adjuvants for the development of protein-based vaccines that can overcome all the shortcomings of clinically available formulations, as these agonists fine-tune the crosstalk between innate and adaptive immune systems. However, a critical challenge remains the identification of TLR-agonist adjuvants with increased potency but minimal toxicity. In this context, natural polymers (NPs) and their derivatives originating from plants, animals, or microbes are good candidates for use in the creation of vaccines with both high safety and efficacy profiles [1].","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01024-x"
"cmi","New genetic and epigenetic insights into the chemokine system: the latest discoveries aiding progression toward precision medicine","Over the past thirty years, the importance of chemokines and their seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been increasingly recognized. Chemokine interactions with receptors trigger signaling pathway activity to form a network fundamental to diverse immune processes, including host homeostasis and responses to disease. Genetic and nongenetic regulation of both the expression and structure of chemokines and receptors conveys chemokine functional heterogeneity. Imbalances and defects in the system contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of diseases, including cancer, immune and inflammatory diseases, and metabolic and neurological disorders, which render the system a focus of studies aiming to discover therapies and important biomarkers. The integrated view of chemokine biology underpinning divergence and plasticity has provided insights into immune dysfunction in disease states, including, among others, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this review, by reporting the latest advances in chemokine biology and results from analyses of a plethora of sequencing-based datasets, we outline recent advances in the understanding of the genetic variations and nongenetic heterogeneity of chemokines and receptors and provide an updated view of their contribution to the pathophysiological network, focusing on chemokine-mediated inflammation and cancer.

"cmi","Revisiting the role of mesenchymal stem cells in tuberculosis and other infectious diseases","Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) play diverse roles ranging from regeneration and wound healing to immune signaling. Recent investigations have indicated the crucial role of these multipotent stem cells in regulating various aspects of the immune system. MSCs express unique signaling molecules and secrete various soluble factors that play critical roles in modulating and shaping immune responses, and in some other cases, MSCs can also exert direct antimicrobial effects, thereby helping with the eradication of invading organisms. Recently, it has been demonstrated that MSCs are recruited at the periphery of the granuloma containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis and exert “Janus”-like functions by harboring pathogens and mediating host protective immune responses. This leads to the establishment of a dynamic balance between the host and the pathogen. MSCs function through various immunomodulatory factors such as nitric oxide (NO), IDO, and immunosuppressive cytokines. Recently, our group has shown that M.tb uses MSCs as a niche to evade host protective immune surveillance mechanisms and establish dormancy. MSCs also express a large number of ABC efflux pumps; therefore, dormant M.tb residing in MSCs are exposed to a suboptimal dose of drugs. Therefore, it is highly likely that drug resistance is coupled with dormancy and originates within MSCs. In this review, we discussed various immunomodulatory properties of MSCs, their interactions with important immune cells, and soluble factors. We also discussed the possible roles of MSCs in the outcome of multiple infections and in shaping the immune system, which may provide insight into therapeutic approaches using these cells in different infection models.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01028-7"

However, how these practices affect immune function is not well understood.

"cmi","Current perspectives on mesenchymal stromal cell therapy for graft versus host disease","Graft versus host disease (GvHD) is the clinical condition in which bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been most frequently studied. In this review, we summarize the experience from clinical trials that have paved the way to translation. While MSC-based therapy has shown an exceptional safety profile, identifying potency assays and disease biomarkers that reliably predict the capacity of a specific MSC batch to alleviate GvHD has been difficult. As GvHD diagnosis and staging are based solely on clinical criteria, individual patients recruited in the same clinical trial may have vastly different underlying biology, obscuring trial outcomes and making it difficult to determine the benefit of MSCs in subgroups of patients. An accumulating body of evidence indicates the importance of considering not only the cell product but also patient-specific biomarkers and/or immune characteristics in determining MSC responsiveness. A mode of action where intravascular MSC destruction is followed by monocyte-efferocytosis-mediated skewing of the immune repertoire in a permissive inflammatory environment would both explain why cell engraftment is irrelevant for MSC efficacy and stress the importance of biologic differences between responding and nonresponding patients. We recommend a combined analysis of clinical outcomes and both biomarkers of disease activity and MSC potency assays to identify patients with GvHD who are likely to benefit from MSC therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01022-z"
"cmi","Tempering of exhausted T cells to comprehend their adaptive response for suitable clinical translation","Although cancer immunotherapy has taken center stage, exhaustion of T cells is undeniably one of the major problems preventing it from being fully successful [1]. Certainly, reversal of T-cell exhaustion or dysfunction is of great importance for developing new strategies and restoring immune function. Nevertheless, counterarguments about the adverse effect of reversing T-cell exhaustion (leading to overactivation of T cells and cytotoxicity) and even their irreversible properties have been quite common in scientific debates. With more to be discovered about the reasons for T-cell failure, a better understanding of the molecular factors/determinants [2, 3] that shape/remodel “heterogeneous” dysfunctional T cells in cancer makes clear sense. Indeed, two recent publications in Nature immunology have described the intriguing perspective of T-cell exhaustion [4, 5]. Of interest, Vignali et al. focused on the hypoxia-driven CD39-dependent suppressor function of exhausted T cells, whereas Saadey et al. emphasized restoring the epigenetic balance of TGF[beta]1/BMP signaling in exhausted T cells to unlock responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01031-y"

CD57 marks dysfunctional T cells that have differentiated after antigenic stimulation. Indeed, while circulating CD57+ CD4+ T cells are normally rare, we found that they are increased in patients with PAD and markedly increased with CTLA4 haploinsufficiency or blockade. We performed single-cell RNA-seq analysis of matched CD57+ CD4+ T cells from blood and tonsil samples. Circulating CD57+ CD4+ T cells (CD4cyt) exhibited a cytotoxic transcriptome similar to that of CD8+ effector cells, could kill B cells, and inhibited B-cell responses. CTLA4 restrained the formation of CD4cyt. While CD57 also marked an abundant subset of follicular helper T cells, which is consistent with their antigen-driven differentiation, this subset had a pre-exhaustion transcriptomic signature marked by TCF7, TOX, and ID3 expression and constitutive expression of CTLA4 and did not become cytotoxic even after CTLA4 inhibition. Thus, CD57+ CD4+ T-cell cytotoxicity and exhaustion phenotypes are compartmentalised between blood and germinal centers. CTLA4 is a key modifier of CD4+ T-cell cytotoxicity, and the pathological CD4cyt phenotype is accentuated by infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01027-8"

Since a similar trend may also take place in other countries and information on the biological properties of the XBB.1.16 lineage is scarce, we conducted a rapid assessment of the SARS-CoV-2 XBB.1.16 lineage with respect to its ability to enter cells and evade neutralisation by antibodies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01030-z"
"cmi","Culture-expanded mesenchymal stromal cell therapy: does it work in knee osteoarthritis? A pathway to clinical success","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative multifactorial disease with concomitant structural, inflammatory, and metabolic changes that fluctuate in a temporal and patient-specific manner. This complexity has contributed to refractory responses to various treatments. MSCs have shown promise as multimodal therapeutics in mitigating OA symptoms and disease progression. Here, we evaluated 15 randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) and 11 nonrandomized RCTs using culture-expanded MSCs in the treatment of knee OA, and we found net positive effects of MSCs on mitigating pain and symptoms (improving function in 12/15 RCTs relative to baseline and in 11/15 RCTs relative to control groups at study endpoints) and on cartilage protection and/or repair (18/21 clinical studies). We examined MSC dose, tissue of origin, and autologous vs. allogeneic origins as well as patient clinical phenotype, endotype, age, sex and level of OA severity as key parameters in parsing MSC clinical effectiveness. The relatively small sample size of 610 patients limited the drawing of definitive conclusions. Nonetheless, we noted trends toward moderate to higher doses of MSCs in select OA patient clinical phenotypes mitigating pain and leading to structural improvements or cartilage preservation. Evidence from preclinical studies is supportive of MSC anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, but additional investigations on immunomodulatory, chondroprotective and other clinical mechanisms of action are needed. We hypothesize that MSC basal immunomodulatory “fitness” correlates with OA treatment efficacy, but this hypothesis needs to be validated in future studies. We conclude with a roadmap articulating the need to match an OA patient subset defined by molecular endotype and clinical phenotype with basally immunomodulatory “fit” or engineered-to-be-fit-for-OA MSCs in well-designed, data-intensive clinical trials to advance the field.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01020-1"
"cmi","The critical role of apoptosis in mesenchymal stromal cell therapeutics and implications in homeostasis and normal tissue repair","Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been extensively tested for the treatment of numerous clinical conditions and have demonstrated good safety but mixed efficacy. Although this outcome can be attributed in part to the heterogeneity of cell preparations, the lack of mechanistic understanding and tools to establish cell pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as the poorly defined criteria for patient stratification, have hampered the design of informative clinical trials. We and others have demonstrated that MSCs can rapidly undergo apoptosis after their infusion. Apoptotic MSCs are phagocytosed by monocytes/macrophages that are then reprogrammed to become anti-inflammatory cells. MSC apoptosis occurs when the cells are injected into patients who harbor activated cytotoxic T or NK cells. Therefore, the activation state of cytotoxic T or NK cells can be used as a biomarker to predict clinical responses to MSC treatment. Building on a large body of preexisting data, an alternative view on the mechanism of MSCs is that an inflammation-dependent MSC secretome is largely responsible for their immunomodulatory activity. We will discuss how these different mechanisms can coexist and are instructed by two different types of MSC “licensing”: one that is cell-contact dependent and the second that is mediated by inflammatory cytokines. The varied and complex mechanisms by which MSCs can orchestrate inflammatory responses and how this function is specifically driven by inflammation support a physiological role for tissue stroma in tissue homeostasis, and it acts as a sensor of damage and initiator of tissue repair by reprogramming the inflammatory environment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01018-9"

"cmi","Fatty acid desaturation by stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 controls regulatory T cell differentiation and autoimmunity","The imbalance between pathogenic and protective T cell subsets is a cardinal feature of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Emerging evidence indicates that endogenous and dietary-induced changes in fatty acid metabolism have a major impact on both T cell fate and autoimmunity. To date, however, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the impact of fatty acid metabolism on T cell physiology and autoimmunity remain poorly understood. Here, we report that stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), an enzyme essential for the desaturation of fatty acids and highly regulated by dietary factors, acts as an endogenous brake on regulatory T-cell (Treg) differentiation and augments autoimmunity in an animal model of MS in a T cell-dependent manner. Guided by RNA sequencing and lipidomics analysis, we found that the absence of Scd1 in T cells promotes the hydrolysis of triglycerides and phosphatidylcholine through adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL). ATGL-dependent release of docosahexaenoic acid enhanced Treg differentiation by activating the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. Our findings identify fatty acid desaturation by SCD1 as an essential determinant of Treg differentiation and autoimmunity, with potentially broad implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and dietary interventions for autoimmune disorders such as MS.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01011-2"
"cmi","IL-6 prevents Th2 cell polarization by promoting SOCS3-dependent suppression of IL-2 signaling","Defective interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling has been associated with Th2 bias and elevated IgE levels. However, the underlying mechanism by which IL-6 prevents the development of Th2-driven diseases remains unknown. Using a model of house dust mite (HDM)-induced Th2 cell differentiation and allergic airway inflammation, we showed that IL-6 signaling in allergen-specific T cells was required to prevent Th2 cell differentiation and the subsequent IgE response and allergic inflammation. Th2 cell lineage commitment required strong sustained IL-2 signaling. We found that IL-6 turned off IL-2 signaling during early T-cell activation and thus inhibited Th2 priming. Mechanistically, IL-6-driven inhibition of IL-2 signaling in responding T cells was mediated by upregulation of Suppressor Of Cytokine Signaling 3 (SOCS3). This mechanism could be mimicked by pharmacological Janus Kinase-1 (JAK1) inhibition. Collectively, our results identify an unrecognized mechanism that prevents the development of unwanted Th2 cell responses and associated diseases and outline potential preventive interventions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01012-1"
"cmi","Regulation of c-SMAC formation and AKT-mTOR signaling by the TSG101-IFT20 axis in CD4+ T cells","CD4+ T cells play major roles in the adaptive immune system, which requires antigen recognition, costimulation, and cytokines for its elaborate orchestration. Recent studies have provided new insight into the importance of the supramolecular activation cluster (SMAC), which comprises concentric circles and is involved in the amplification of CD4+ T cell activation. However, the underlying mechanism of SMAC formation remains poorly understood. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of CD4+ T cells left unstimulated and stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies to identify novel proteins involved in their regulation. We found that intraflagellar transport 20 (IFT20), previously known as cilia-forming protein, was upregulated in antibody-stimulated CD4+ T cells compared to unstimulated CD4+ T cells. We also found that IFT20 interacted with tumor susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), a protein that endocytoses ubiquitinated T-cell receptors. The interaction between IFT20 and TSG101 promoted SMAC formation, which led to amplification of AKT-mTOR signaling. However, IFT20-deficient CD4+ T cells showed SMAC malformation, resulting in reduced CD4+ T cell proliferation, aerobic glycolysis, and cellular respiration. Finally, mice with T-cell-specific IFT20 deficiency exhibited reduced allergen-induced airway inflammation. Thus, our data suggest that the IFT20-TSG101 axis regulates AKT-mTOR signaling via SMAC formation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-01008-x"

MSCs can be isolated from discarded tissues, expanded in vitro and used as therapeutics for autoimmune diseases and other chronic disorders. MSCs promote tissue regeneration and homeostasis by primarily acting on immune cells. At least six different types of MSCs have been isolated from postnatal dental tissues and have remarkable immunomodulatory properties. Dental stem cells (DSCs) have been demonstrated to have therapeutic effects on several systemic inflammatory diseases. Conversely, MSCs derived from nondental tissues such as the umbilical cord exhibit great benefits in the management of periodontitis in preclinical studies. Here, we discuss the main therapeutic uses of MSCs/DSCs, their mechanisms, extrinsic inflammatory cues and the intrinsic metabolic circuitries that govern the immunomodulatory functions of MSCs/DSCs. Increased understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the immunomodulatory functions of MSCs/DSCs is expected to aid in the development of more potent and precise MSC/DSC-based therapeutics.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-00998-y"
"cmi","A T follicular helper cell origin for T regulatory type 1 cells","Chronic antigenic stimulation can trigger the differentiation of antigen-experienced CD4+ T cells into T regulatory type 1 (TR1) cells, a subset of interleukin-10-producing Treg cells that do not express FOXP3. The identities of the progenitor(s) and transcriptional regulators of this T-cell subset remain unclear. Here, we show that the peptide-major histocompatibility complex class II (pMHCII) monospecific immunoregulatory T-cell pools that arise in vivo in different genetic backgrounds in response to pMHCII-coated nanoparticles (pMHCII-NPs) are invariably comprised of oligoclonal subpools of T follicular helper (TFH) and TR1 cells with a nearly identical clonotypic composition but different functional properties and transcription factor expression profiles. Pseudotime analyses of scRNAseq data and multidimensional mass cytometry revealed progressive downregulation and upregulation of TFH and TR1 markers, respectively. Furthermore, pMHCII-NPs trigger cognate TR1 cell formation in TFH cell-transfused immunodeficient hosts, and T-cell-specific deletion of Bcl6 or Irf4 blunts both the TFH expansion and TR1 formation induced by pMHCII-NPs. In contrast, deletion of Prdm1 selectively abrogates the TFH-to-TR1 conversion. Bcl6 and Prdm1 are also necessary for anti-CD3 mAb-induced TR1 formation. Thus, TFH cells can differentiate into TR1 cells in vivo, and BLIMP1 is a gatekeeper of this cellular reprogramming event.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-00989-z"

Within an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, DC antitumor functions can, however, be severely impaired. In this review, we focus on the mechanisms of DC capture and activation by tumor cell antigens and the role of the tumor microenvironment in shaping DC functions, taking advantage of recent studies showing the phenotype acquisition, transcriptional state and functional programs revealed by scRNA-seq analysis. The therapeutic potential of DC-mediated tumor antigen sensing in priming antitumor immunity is also discussed.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-00990-6"

However, drugs that are effective against inflammation to treat lethal COVID-19 are still urgently needed. Here, we constructed a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific CAR, and human T cells infected with this CAR (SARS-CoV-2-S CAR-T) and stimulated with spike protein mimicked the T-cell responses seen in COVID-19 patients, causing cytokine storm and displaying a distinct memory, exhausted, and regulatory T-cell phenotype. THP1 remarkably augmented cytokine release in SARS-CoV-2-S CAR-T cells when they were in coculture. Based on this “two-cell” (CAR-T and THP1 cells) model, we screened an FDA-approved drug library and found that felodipine, fasudil, imatinib, and caspofungin were effective in suppressing the release of cytokines, which was likely due to their ability to suppress the NF-[kappa]B pathway in vitro. Felodipine, fasudil, imatinib, and caspofungin were further demonstrated, although to different extents, to attenuate lethal inflammation, ameliorate severe pneumonia, and prevent mortality in a SARS-CoV-2-infected Syrian hamster model, which were also linked to their suppressive role in inflammation. In summary, we established a SARS-CoV-2-specific CAR-T-cell model that can be utilized as a tool for anti-inflammatory drug screening in a fast and high-throughput manner. The drugs identified herein have great potential for early treatment to prevent COVID-19 patients from cytokine storm-induced lethality in the clinic because they are safe, inexpensive, and easily accessible for immediate use in most countries.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-00985-3"

"cmi","The chemokines CXCL8 and CXCL12: molecular and functional properties, role in disease and efforts towards pharmacological intervention","Chemokines are an indispensable component of our immune system through the regulation of directional migration and activation of leukocytes. CXCL8 is the most potent human neutrophil-attracting chemokine and plays crucial roles in the response to infection and tissue injury. CXCL8 activity inherently depends on interaction with the human CXC chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2, the atypical chemokine receptor ACKR1, and glycosaminoglycans. Furthermore, (hetero)dimerization and tight regulation of transcription and translation, as well as post-translational modifications further fine-tune the spatial and temporal activity of CXCL8 in the context of inflammatory diseases and cancer. The CXCL8 interaction with receptors and glycosaminoglycans is therefore a promising target for therapy, as illustrated by multiple ongoing clinical trials. CXCL8-mediated neutrophil mobilization to blood is directly opposed by CXCL12, which retains leukocytes in bone marrow. CXCL12 is primarily a homeostatic chemokine that induces migration and activation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, endothelial cells, and several leukocytes through interaction with CXCR4, ACKR1, and ACKR3. Thereby, it is an essential player in the regulation of embryogenesis, hematopoiesis, and angiogenesis. However, CXCL12 can also exert inflammatory functions, as illustrated by its pivotal role in a growing list of pathologies and its synergy with CXCL8 and other chemokines to induce leukocyte chemotaxis. Here, we review the plethora of information on the CXCL8 structure, interaction with receptors and glycosaminoglycans, different levels of activity regulation, role in homeostasis and disease, and therapeutic prospects. Finally, we discuss recent research on CXCL12 biochemistry and biology and its role in pathology and pharmacology.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-00974-6"
"cmi","CD8+ CD226high T cells in liver metastases dictate the prognosis of colorectal cancer patients treated with chemotherapy and radical surgery","CD226 has been reported to participate in the rescue of CD8+ T cell dysfunction. In this study, we aimed to assess the prognostic value of CD226 in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) derived from colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases treated with chemotherapy and radical surgery. TILs from 43 metastases were isolated and analyzed ex vivo using flow cytometry. CD155 and CD3 levels in the tumor microenvironment were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Exploration and validation of biological processes highlighted in this study were performed by bioinformatics analysis of bulk RNA-seq results for 28 CRC liver metastases pretreated with chemotherapy as well as public gene expression datasets. CD226 expression contributes to the definition of the immune context in CRC liver metastases and primary tumors. CD226 on CD8+ T cells was not specifically coexpressed with other immune checkpoints, such as PD1, TIGIT, and TIM3, in liver metastases. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed CD226 expression on CD8+ T cells to be an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.003), along with CD3 density at invasion margins (p = 0.003) and TIGIT expression on CD4+ T cells (p = 0.019). CD155 was not associated with the prognostic value of CD226. Gene expression analysis in a validation dataset confirmed the prognostic value of CD226 in CRC liver metastases but not in primary tumors. Downregulation of CD226 on CD8+ TILs in the liver microenvironment was restored by IL15 treatment. Overall, CD226 expression on liver metastasis-infiltrating CD8+ T cells selectively contributes to immune surveillance of CRC liver metastases and has prognostic value for patients undergoing radical surgery.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-00978-2"

While rumors even suggest that it might have killed Napoleon, more recent work suggests ATO as a potential treatment option for acute promyelocytic leukemia [1]. While the potency of ATO in cell killing has been recognized, hardly anyone has considered the immunological consequences of cell death in tumors or tissues following ATO treatment. In this issue of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Chen et al. address this question, adding yet another chapter to the complex relation between cell death and the immune response (Fig. 1) [2].Fig. 1Arsenic trioxide (As2O3, ATO)-induced immunogenic cell death in tumors as a tool to elicit antitumor immunity. Whole-cell tumor vaccines generated using cytotoxic drugs ex vivo offer an attractive approach to target virus-irrelevant neoplasms. Applying this knowledge, Chen et al. explored the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of an ATO-based whole-cell vaccine. Preconditioning of tumor cells with ATO induces oxidative stress, which, simultaneously or sequentially, triggers cell death pathways such as apoptosis, ferroptosis and necroptosis. These pathways are associated with the release or exposure of numerous immunogenic factors that activate the immune system. Deletion of executors of each of the involved death pathways inhibited tumor cell death and thus blocked the release of immunogenic factors. The prophylactic and therapeutic administration of an ATO-based whole-cell vaccine (ATO-VAC) successfully induced an adaptive immune response. Thus, a strong antitumor response in the recipient mice was elicited by creating a highly immunogenic tumor microenvironment that was flooded with activated tumor-infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells with heightened effector cytokine production, leading to tumor prevention or regressionFull size image","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-023-00976-4"

Extracellular cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (eCIRP) is a damage-associated molecular pattern that causes inflammation. However, whether eCIRP regulates macrophage bacterial phagocytosis is unknown. Here, we reported that the bacterial loads in the blood and peritoneal fluid were decreased in CIRP−/− mice and anti-eCIRP Ab-treated mice after sepsis. Increased eCIRP levels were correlated with decreased bacterial clearance in septic mice. CIRP−/− mice showed a marked increase in survival after sepsis. Recombinant murine CIRP (rmCIRP) significantly decreased the phagocytosis of bacteria by macrophages in vivo and in vitro. rmCIRP decreased the protein expression of actin-binding proteins, ARP2, and p-cofilin in macrophages. rmCIRP significantly downregulated the protein expression of [beta]PIX, a Rac1 activator. We further demonstrated that STAT3 and [beta]PIX formed a complex following rmCIRP treatment, preventing [beta]PIX from activating Rac1. We also found that eCIRP-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was required for eCIRP's action in actin remodeling. Inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation prevented the formation of the STAT3-[beta]PIX complex, restoring ARP2 and p-cofilin expression and membrane protrusion in rmCIRP-treated macrophages. The STAT3 inhibitor stattic rescued the macrophage phagocytic dysfunction induced by rmCIRP. Thus, we identified a novel mechanism of macrophage phagocytic dysfunction caused by eCIRP, which provides a new therapeutic target to ameliorate sepsis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00961-3"
"cmi","Identification of common and distinct origins of human serum and breastmilk IgA1 by mass spectrometry-based clonal profiling","The most abundant immunoglobulin present in the human body is IgA. It has the highest concentrations at the mucosal lining and in biofluids such as milk and is the second most abundant class of antibodies in serum. We assessed the structural diversity and clonal repertoire of IgA1-containing molecular assemblies longitudinally in human serum and milk from three donors using a mass spectrometry-based approach. IgA-containing molecules purified from serum or milk were assessed by the release and subsequent analysis of their Fab fragments. Our data revealed that serum IgA1 consists of two distinct structural populations, namely monomeric IgA1 (∼80%) and dimeric joining (J-) chain coupled IgA1 (∼20%). Also, we confirmed that IgA1 in milk is present solely as secretory (S)IgA, consisting of two (∼50%), three (∼33%) or four (∼17%) IgA1 molecules assembled with a J-chain and secretory component (SC). Interestingly, the serum and milk IgA1-Fab repertoires were distinct between monomeric, and J-chain coupled dimeric IgA1. The serum dimeric J-chain coupled IgA1 repertoire contained several abundant clones also observed in the milk IgA1 repertoire. The latter repertoire had little to no overlap with the serum monomeric IgA1 repertoire. This suggests that human IgA1s have (at least) two distinct origins; one of these produces dimeric J-chain coupled IgA1 molecules, shared in human serum and milk, and another produces monomeric IgA1 ending up exclusively in serum.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00954-2"

"cmi","Disrupted Ca2+ homeostasis and immunodeficiency in patients with functional IP3 receptor subtype 3 defects","Calcium signaling is essential for lymphocyte activation, with genetic disruptions of store-operated calcium (Ca2+) entry resulting in severe immunodeficiency. The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), a homo- or heterotetramer of the IP3R1-3 isoforms, amplifies lymphocyte signaling by releasing Ca2+ from endoplasmic reticulum stores following antigen stimulation. Although knockout of all IP3R isoforms in mice causes immunodeficiency, the seeming redundancy of the isoforms is thought to explain the absence of variants in human immunodeficiency. In this study, we identified compound heterozygous variants of ITPR3 (a gene encoding IP3R subtype 3) in two unrelated Caucasian patients presenting with immunodeficiency. To determine whether ITPR3 variants act in a nonredundant manner and disrupt human immune responses, we characterized the Ca2+ signaling capacity, the lymphocyte response, and the clinical phenotype of these patients. We observed disrupted Ca2+ signaling in patient-derived fibroblasts and immune cells, with abnormal proliferation and activation responses following T-cell receptor stimulation. Reconstitution of IP3R3 in IP3R knockout cell lines led to the identification of variants as functional hypomorphs that showed reduced ability to discriminate between homeostatic and induced states, validating a genotype-phenotype link. These results demonstrate a functional link between defective endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ channels and immunodeficiency and identify IP3Rs as diagnostic targets for patients with specific inborn errors of immunity. These results also extend the known cause of Ca2+-associated immunodeficiency from store-operated entry to impaired Ca2+ mobilization from the endoplasmic reticulum, revealing a broad sensitivity of lymphocytes to genetic defects in Ca2+ signaling.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00928-4"
"cmi","Infection, pathology and interferon treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 variant in juvenile, adult and aged Syrian hamsters","The new predominant circulating SARS-CoV-2 variant, Omicron, can robustly escape current vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. Although Omicron has been reported to have milder replication and disease manifestations than some earlier variants, its pathogenicity in different age groups has not been well elucidated. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.1 sublineage causes elevated infection and lung pathogenesis in juvenile and aged hamsters, with more body weight loss, respiratory tract viral burden, and lung injury in these hamsters than in adult hamsters. Juvenile hamsters show a reduced interferon response against Omicron BA.1 infection, whereas aged hamsters show excessive proinflammatory cytokine expression, delayed viral clearance, and aggravated lung injury. Early inhaled IFN-[alpha]2b treatment suppresses Omicron BA.1 infection and lung pathogenesis in juvenile and adult hamsters. Overall, the data suggest that the diverse patterns of the innate immune response affect the disease outcomes of Omicron BA.1 infection in different age groups.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00923-9"
"cmi","Reprogramming of cancer-associated fibroblasts by apoptotic cancer cells inhibits lung metastasis via Notch1-WISP-1 signaling","The interplay between apoptotic cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment modulates cancer progression and metastasis. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a crucial role in promoting these events through paracrine communication. Here, we demonstrate that conditioned medium (CM) from lung CAFs exposed to apoptotic cancer cells suppresses TGF-[beta]1-induced migration and invasion of cancer cells and CAFs. Direct exposure of CAFs to apoptotic 344SQ cells (ApoSQ) inhibited CAF migration and invasion and the expression of CAF activation markers. Enhanced secretion of Wnt‐induced signaling protein 1 (WISP-1) by CAFs exposed to ApoSQ was required for these antimigratory and anti-invasive effects. Pharmacological inhibition of Notch1 activation or siRNA-mediated Notch1 silencing prevented WISP-1 production by CAFs and reversed the antimigratory and anti-invasive effects. Enhanced expression of the Notch ligand delta-like protein 1 on the surface of ultraviolet-irradiated apoptotic lung cancer cells triggered Notch1-WISP-1 signaling. Phosphatidylserine receptor brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor 1 (BAI1)-Rac1 signaling, which facilitated efferocytosis by CAFs, participated in crosstalk with Notch1 signaling for optimal production of WISP-1. In addition, a single injection of ApoSQ enhanced WISP-1 production, suppressed the expression of CAF activation markers in isolated Thy1+ CAFs, and inhibited lung metastasis in syngeneic immunocompetent mice via Notch1 signaling. Treatment with CM from CAFs exposed to ApoSQ suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis, whereas treatment with WISP-1-immunodepleted CM from CAFs exposed to ApoSQ reversed the antitumorigenic and antimetastatic effects. Therefore, treatment with CM from CAFs exposed to apoptotic lung cancer cells could be therapeutically applied to suppress CAF activation, thereby preventing cancer progression and metastasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00930-w"
"cmi","Epigenetic regulation of B cells and its role in autoimmune pathogenesis","B cells play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Although previous studies have shown many genetic polymorphisms associated with B-cell activation in patients with various autoimmune disorders, progress in epigenetic research has revealed new mechanisms leading to B-cell hyperactivation. Epigenetic mechanisms, including those involving histone modifications, DNA methylation, and noncoding RNAs, regulate B-cell responses, and their dysregulation can contribute to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Patients with autoimmune diseases show epigenetic alterations that lead to the initiation and perpetuation of autoimmune inflammation. Moreover, many clinical and animal model studies have shown the promising potential of epigenetic therapies for patients. In this review, we present an up-to-date overview of epigenetic mechanisms with a focus on their roles in regulating functional B-cell subsets. Furthermore, we discuss epigenetic dysregulation in B cells and highlight its contribution to the development of autoimmune diseases. Based on clinical and preclinical evidence, we discuss novel epigenetic biomarkers and therapies for patients with autoimmune disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00933-7"
"cmi","Tumor extracellular vesicles mediate anti-PD-L1 therapy resistance by decoying anti-PD-L1","PD-L1+ tumor-derived extracellular vesicles (TEVs) cause systemic immunosuppression and possibly resistance to anti-PD-L1 antibody ([alpha]PD-L1) blockade. However, whether and how PD-L1+ TEVs mediate [alpha]PD-L1 therapy resistance is unknown. Here, we show that PD-L1+ TEVs substantially decoy [alpha]PD-L1 and that TEV-bound [alpha]PD-L1 is more rapidly cleared by macrophages, causing insufficient blockade of tumor PD-L1 and subsequent [alpha]PD-L1 therapy resistance. Inhibition of endogenous production of TEVs by Rab27a or Coro1a knockout reverses [alpha]PD-L1 therapy resistance. Either an increased [alpha]PD-L1 dose or macrophage depletion mediated by the clinical drug pexidartinib abolishes [alpha]PD-L1 therapy resistance. Moreover, in the treatment cycle with the same total treatment dose of [alpha]PD-L1, high-dose and low-frequency treatment had better antitumor effects than low-dose and high-frequency treatment, induced stronger antitumor immune memory, and eliminated [alpha]PD-L1 therapy resistance. Notably, in humanized immune system mice with human xenograft tumors, both increased [alpha]PD-L1 dose and high-dose and low-frequency treatment enhanced the antitumor effects of [alpha]PD-L1. Furthermore, increased doses of [alpha]PD-L1 and [alpha]PD-1 had comparable antitumor effects, but [alpha]PD-L1 amplified fewer PD-1+ Treg cells, which are responsible for tumor hyperprogression. Altogether, our results reveal a TEV-mediated mechanism of [alpha]PD-L1-specific therapy resistance, thus providing promising strategies to improve [alpha]PD-L1 efficacy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00926-6"

In pathologic states such as diabetes, macrophage plasticity is impaired, and macrophages remain in a persistent proinflammatory state; however, the reasons for this are unknown. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing of human diabetic wounds, we identified increased JMJD3 in diabetic wound macrophages, resulting in increased inflammatory gene expression. Mechanistically, we report that in wound healing, JMJD3 directs early macrophage-mediated inflammation via JAK1,3/STAT3 signaling. However, in the diabetic state, we found that IL-6, a cytokine increased in diabetic wound tissue at later time points post-injury, regulates JMJD3 expression in diabetic wound macrophages via the JAK1,3/STAT3 pathway and that this late increase in JMJD3 induces NF[kappa]B-mediated inflammatory gene transcription in wound macrophages via an H3K27me3 mechanism. Interestingly, RNA sequencing of wound macrophages isolated from mice with JMJD3-deficient myeloid cells (Jmjd3f/fLyz2Cre+) identified that the STING gene (Tmem173) is regulated by JMJD3 in wound macrophages. STING limits inflammatory cytokine production by wound macrophages during healing. However, in diabetic mice, its role changes to limit wound repair and enhance inflammation. This finding is important since STING is associated with chronic inflammation, and we found STING to be elevated in human and murine diabetic wound macrophages at late time points. Finally, we demonstrate that macrophage-specific, nanoparticle inhibition of JMJD3 in diabetic wounds significantly improves diabetic wound repair by decreasing inflammatory cytokines and STING. Taken together, this work highlights the central role of JMJD3 in tissue repair and identifies cell-specific targeting as a viable therapeutic strategy for nonhealing diabetic wounds.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00919-5"
"cmi","How location and cellular signaling combine to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome","NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) is a cytosolic innate immune sensor of cellular stress signals, triggered by infection and sterile inflammation. Upon detection of an activating stimulus, NLRP3 transitions from an inactive homo-oligomeric multimer into an active multimeric inflammasome, which promotes the helical oligomeric assembly of the adaptor molecule ASC. ASC oligomers provide a platform for caspase-1 activation, leading to the proteolytic cleavage and activation of proinflammatory cytokines in the IL-1 family and gasdermin D, which can induce a lytic form of cell death. Recent studies investigating both the cellular requirement for NLRP3 activation and the structure of NLRP3 have revealed the complex regulation of NLRP3 and the multiple steps involved in its activation. This review presents a perspective on the biochemical and cellular processes controlling the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome with particular emphasis on structural regulation and the role of organelles. We also highlight the latest research on metabolic control of this inflammatory pathway and discuss promising clinical targets for intervention.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00922-w"
"cmi","Redox regulation of the immune response","The immune-inflammatory response is associated with increased nitro-oxidative stress. The aim of this mechanistic review is to examine: (a) the role of redox-sensitive transcription factors and enzymes, ROS/RNS production, and the activity of cellular antioxidants in the activation and performance of macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, T-cells, B-cells, and natural killer cells; (b) the involvement of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), paraoxonase-1 (PON1), and oxidized phospholipids in regulating the immune response; and (c) the detrimental effects of hypernitrosylation and chronic nitro-oxidative stress on the immune response. The redox changes during immune-inflammatory responses are orchestrated by the actions of nuclear factor-[kappa]B, HIF1[alpha], the mechanistic target of rapamycin, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinases, 5' AMP-activated protein kinase, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor. The performance and survival of individual immune cells is under redox control and depends on intracellular and extracellular levels of ROS/RNS. They are heavily influenced by cellular antioxidants including the glutathione and thioredoxin systems, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, and the HDL/ApoA1/PON1 complex. Chronic nitro-oxidative stress and hypernitrosylation inhibit the activity of those antioxidant systems, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, mitochondrial functions, and the metabolism of immune cells. In conclusion, redox-associated mechanisms modulate metabolic reprogramming of immune cells, macrophage and T helper cell polarization, phagocytosis, production of pro- versus anti-inflammatory cytokines, immune training and tolerance, chemotaxis, pathogen sensing, antiviral and antibacterial effects, Toll-like receptor activity, and endotoxin tolerance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00902-0"
"cmi","Influenza A virus use of BinCARD1 to facilitate the binding of viral NP to importin [alpha]7 is counteracted by TBK1-p62 axis-mediated autophagy","As a major component of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex in influenza A virus (IAV), nucleoprotein (NP) interacts with isoforms of importin [alpha] family members, leading to the import of itself  and vRNP complex into the nucleus, a process pivotal in the replication cycle of IAV. In this study, we found that BinCARD1, an isoform of Bcl10-interacting protein with CARD (BinCARD), was leveraged by IAV for efficient viral replication. BinCARD1 promoted the nuclear import of the vRNP complex and newly synthesized NP and thus enhanced vRNP complex activity. Moreover, we found that BinCARD1 interacted with NP to promote NP binding to importin [alpha]7, an adaptor in the host nuclear import pathway. However, we also found that BinCARD1 promoted RIG-I-mediated innate immune signaling by mediating Lys63-linked polyubiquitination of TRAF3, and that TBK1 appeared to degrade BinCARD1. We showed that BinCARD1 was polyubiquitinated at residue K103 through a Lys63 linkage, which was recognized by the TBK1-p62 axis for autophagic degradation. Overall, our data demonstrate that IAV leverages BinCARD1 as an important host factor that promotes viral replication, and two mechanisms in the host defense system are triggered-innate immune signaling and autophagic degradation-to mitigate the promoting effect of BinCARD1 on the life cycle of IAV.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00906-w"
"cmi","Sphingosine kinase 1 promotes tumor immune evasion by regulating the MTA3-PD-L1 axis","Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) exhibits considerable benefits in malignancies, but its overall response rate is limited. Previous studies have shown that sphingosine kinases (SPHKs) are critical in the tumor microenvironment (TME), but their role in immunotherapy is unclear. We performed integrative analyses including bioinformatics analysis, functional study, and clinical validation to investigate the role of SPHK1 in tumor immunity. Functionally, we demonstrated that the inhibition of SPHK1 significantly suppressed tumor growth by promoting antitumor immunity in immunocompetent melanoma mouse models and tumor T-cell cocultures. A mechanistic analysis revealed that MTA3 functions as the downstream target of SPHK1 in transcriptionally regulating tumor PD-L1. Preclinically, we found that anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment significantly rescued tumor SPHK1 overexpression or tumor MTA3 overexpression-mediated immune evasion. Significantly, we identified SPHK1 and MTA3 as biological markers for predicting the efficacy of anti-PD-1 mAb therapy in melanoma patients. Our findings revealed a novel role for SPHK1 in tumor evasion mediated by regulating the MTA3-PD-L1 axis, identified SPHK1 and MTA3 as predictors for assessing the efficacy of PD-1 mAb treatment, and provided a therapeutic possibility for the treatment of melanoma patients.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00911-z"

We have generated a unique murine model named ARE-Del, with chronic overexpression of IFN[gamma], by altering IFN[gamma] metabolism. Importantly, these mice develop an immunologic and clinical profile similar to patients with primary biliary cholangitis, including high titers of autoantibodies and portal inflammation. We hypothesized that the downregulation of IFN signaling pathways with a JAK1/2 inhibitor would inhibit the development and progression of cholangitis. To study this hypothesis, ARE-Del+/− mice were treated with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib and serially studied. JAK inhibition resulted in a significant reduction in portal inflammation and bile duct damage, associated with a significant reduction in splenic and hepatic CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. Functionally, ruxolitinib inhibited the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN[gamma] and TNF from splenic CD4+ T cells. Additionally, ruxolitinib treatment also decreased the frequencies of germinal center B (GC B) cells and T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and led to lower serological AMA levels. Of note, liver and peritoneal macrophages were sharply decreased and polarized from M1 to M2 with a higher level of IRF4 expression after ruxolitinib treatment. Mechanistically, ruxolitinib inhibited the secretion of IL-6, TNF and MCP1 and the expression of STAT1 but promoted the expression of STAT6 in macrophages in vitro, indicating that M1 macrophage polarization to M2 occurred through activation of the STAT6-IRF4 pathway. Our data highlight the significance, both immunologically and clinically, of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in autoimmune cholangitis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00904-y"

However, defining the link and/or contribution to a phenotype of rare variants or those with an indirect contribution to disease remains challenging. These variants, however, are key for personalized and precision medicine strategies [1]. In this context, human leukocyte antigens of class II alleles (HLAIIs) facilitate activation of CD4+ T cells and are directly linked to various phenotypes. Non-classical HLAII (ncHLAII) molecules modulate HLAII function and their impact on T-cell responses. The contribution of ncHLAII to phenotypes has been investigated in knockout vs. wild-type cellular and animal models, and recent studies have shown that genetic variants altering the protein-coding regions of these molecules contribute to tuning of HLAII function [2].

Here, we showed that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) produced an abundance of C-C motif chemokine 22 (CCL22), whose expression in the tumor stroma was positively associated with the level of intratumoral phospho-focal adhesion kinase (pFAK Tyr397), tumor metastasis and reduced patient survival. Functionally, CCL22-stimulated hyperactivation of FAK was correlated with increased malignant progression of cancer cells. CCL22-induced addiction to FAK was demonstrated by the persistent suppression of tumor progression upon FAK-specific inhibition. Mechanistically, we identified that diacylglycerol kinase [alpha] (DGK[alpha]) acted as a signaling adaptor to link the CCL22 receptor C-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) and FAK and promoted CCL22-induced activation of the FAK/AKT pathway. CCL22/CCR4 signaling activated the intracellular Ca2+/phospholipase C-[gamma]1 (PLC-[gamma]1) axis to stimulate the phosphorylation of DGK[alpha] at a tyrosine residue (Tyr335) and promoted the translocation of DGK[alpha] to the plasma membrane to assemble the DGK[alpha]/FAK signalosome, which critically contributed to regulating sensitivity to FAK inhibitors in cancer cells. The identification of TAM-driven intratumoral FAK addiction provides opportunities for utilizing the tumor-promoting microenvironment to achieve striking anticancer effects.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00903-z"

Liver cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver metastases are distinct from other cancers in that they typically emerge as a consequence of long-term low-grade inflammation. Understanding the mechanisms that underpin inflammation-driven tissue remodeling of the hepatic immune environment is likely to provide new insights into much needed treatments for this devastating disease. Group 1 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), which include natural killer (NK) cells and ILC1s, are particularly enriched in the liver and thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of a number of liver diseases, including cancer. NK cells are an attractive, but underexplored, therapeutic target in hepatic disease due to their role in immunosurveillance and their ability to recognize and eliminate malignant cells. ILC1s are closely related to and share many phenotypic features with NK cells but are less well studied. Thus, their utility in immunotherapeutic approaches is not yet well understood.

"cmi","Vitamin C and Vitamin D-friends or foes in modulating [gamma][delta] T-cell differentiation?","The differentiation and functional plasticity of T cells are transcriptionally and epigenetically regulated by signals imposed by the local cytokine milieu and a variety of additional factors, including vitamins. Vitamin C has pleiotropic functions in the immune system. It exerts antioxidant activity, can directly kill selected tumor targets, promotes early T-cell differentiation, and enhances Th1 cytokine production in mature T cells [1, 2]. Vitamin C is also an epigenetic modifier that acts on ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes to demethylate FOXP3 and stabilize FOXP3 protein expression and regulatory T-cell (Treg) function [3]. We previously explored the role of vitamin C in the modulation of the activation and differentiation of human [gamma][delta] T cells. [gamma][delta] T cells have recently attracted substantial interest as effector cells in cell-based cancer immunotherapy due to their potent capacity to kill a variety of different cancer cell types in the absence of HLA restriction. While the available data are promising, there is a clear need to optimize the efficacy of [gamma][delta] T cells in clinical applications [4]. For many potential strategies, including the use of [gamma][delta] T-cell-selective activating antibodies or [gamma][delta] T-cell-targeting bispecific antibody constructs and the development of drug-resistant [gamma][delta] T cells, we reasoned that vitamin C might also be considered to boost the effector functions of [gamma][delta] T cells Fig. 1.Fig. 1Modulation of human [gamma][delta] T-cell activation by vitamin C and vitamin D. Vitamin C enhances the cytokine production (notably IFN-[gamma]), proliferative expansion and cytotoxic activity of phosphoantigen-reactive human [gamma][delta] T cells. In the additional presence of TGF-[beta], vitamin C induces hypomethylation of TSDRs in the FOXP3 locus and stabilizes FOXP3 expression in [gamma][delta] T cells [5,6,7]. Vitamin D also modulates the IFN-[gamma] secretion, proliferation and cytotoxic activity of human [gamma][delta] T cells, but the reported effects are controversial. We and others have observed inhibition of proliferation, IFN-[gamma] production and cytotoxicity [13, 14], in contrast to a recent report where the effector functions of [gamma][delta] T cells were found to be enhanced by vitamin D [15]Full size image","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00895-w"

Exosomes are endosome-derived EVs (30-100 nm) that deliver information about proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs to recipient cells [3]. MPs are plasma membrane-derived shedding vesicles with sizes ranging from 0.1 to 1 [mu]m [4]. Relative to the substantial study of exosomes, knowledge of MPs is severely lacking, especially in cancer research. Due to the chaotic nature of the tumor microenvironment, tumor cells release a large number of MPs (tumor cell-derived MPs or T-MPs). Despite their impact on tumor cells themselves, T-MPs can profoundly influence tumor-infiltrating immune cells, especially macrophages, due to their highly efficient uptake of T-MPs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00892-z"

Cytokine storms and oxidative stress are the major players in ARDS development during respiratory virus infections. However, it is still unknown how oxidative stress is regulated by viral and host factors in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we found that activation of NRF2/HMOX1 significantly suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in multiple cell types by producing the metabolite biliverdin, whereas SARS-CoV-2 impaired the NRF2/HMOX1 axis through the action of the nonstructural viral protein NSP14. Mechanistically, NSP14 interacts with the catalytic domain of the NAD-dependent deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and inhibits its ability to activate the NRF2/HMOX1 pathway. Furthermore, both genetic and pharmaceutical evidence corroborated the novel antiviral activity of SIRT1 against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 dysregulates the host antioxidant defense system and emphasize the vital role played by the SIRT1/NRF2 axis in host defense against SARS-CoV-2.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00887-w"

Although the pathological basis and risk factors for SLE have been extensively investigated, the exact pathogenesis of SLE remains to be explored. However, there is increasing evidence that T-cell−B-cell interactions promote the development of SLE, resulting in the generation of high-affinity antibodies [1]. Tfh cells, a subgroup of T cells, can promote the formation of germinal centers, the maturation of B cells, and the differentiation of plasma cells [2]. It has been found that multiple transcription factors (TFs) can regulate the generation of Tfh cells. For instance, B-cell lymphoma-6 (BCL-6), an evolutionarily conserved zinc-finger protein, is an important positive transcription factor responsible for the differentiation and maturation of Tfh cells. In addition to maintaining the phenotype and GC response of Tfh cells, BCL-6 can also regulate the dynamics of T-cell−B-cell interactions and improve the efficiency of delivering help to B cells [3].","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00882-1"

Recently, a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, B.1.640.2, which harbors an unusually high number of mutations in the S protein, was detected in southern France [3].

We showed that p38[alpha] activity in DCs was decreased upon HDM stimulation and dynamically regulated by both extrinsic signals and Th2-instructive cytokines. p38[alpha]-specific deletion in cDC1s but not in cDC2s or macrophages promoted Th2 responses under HDM stimulation. Further study showed that p38[alpha] in cDC1s regulated Th2-cell differentiation by modulating the MK2−c-FOS−IL-12 axis. Importantly, crosstalk between p38[alpha]-dependent DCs and Th2 cells occurred during the sensitization phase, not the effector phase, and was conserved between mice and humans. Our results identify p38[alpha] signaling as a central pathway in DCs that integrates allergic and parasitic instructive signals with Th2-instructive cytokines from the microenvironment to regulate Th2-cell differentiation and function, and this finding may offer a novel strategy for the treatment of allergic diseases and parasitic infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00873-2"
"cmi","IFN-[gamma]+ cytotoxic CD4+ T lymphocytes are involved in the pathogenesis of colitis induced by IL-23 and the food colorant Red 40","The food colorant Red 40 is an environmental risk factor for colitis development in mice with increased expression of interleukin (IL)-23. This immune response is mediated by CD4+ T cells, but mechanistic insights into how these CD4+ T cells trigger and perpetuate colitis have remained elusive. Here, using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we found that several CD4+ T-cell subsets are present in the intestines of colitic mice, including an interferon (IFN)-[gamma]-producing subset. In vivo challenge of primed mice with Red 40 promoted rapid activation of CD4+ T cells and caused marked intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) apoptosis that was attenuated by depletion of CD4+ cells and blockade of IFN-[gamma]. Ex vivo experiments showed that intestinal CD4+ T cells from colitic mice directly promoted apoptosis of IECs and intestinal enteroids. CD4+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity was contact-dependent and required FasL, which promoted caspase-dependent cell death in target IECs. Genetic ablation of IFN-[gamma] constrained IL-23- and Red 40-induced colitis development, and blockade of IFN-[gamma] inhibited epithelial cell death in vivo. These results advance the understanding of the mechanisms regulating colitis development caused by IL-23 and food colorants and identify IFN-[gamma]+ cytotoxic CD4+ T cells as a new potential therapeutic target for colitis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00864-3"

In a study recently published in Nature, Deng et al. extensively outlined a hitherto unknown role of the group A Streptococcus (GAS)-derived cysteine protease streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin B (SpeB) in gasodermin A (GSDMA) cleavage as the primary step in induction of pyroptosis. As clearly shown in GSDMA-deficient mice infected with SpeB-producing GAS, this cleavage event is key to preventing the systemic spread and fatal course of GAS following local skin infection [1].","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00863-4"
"cmi","Mosaic theory revised: inflammation and salt play central roles in arterial hypertension","The mosaic theory of hypertension was advocated by Irvine Page ~80 years ago and suggested that hypertension resulted from the close interactions of different causes. Increasing evidence indicates that hypertension and hypertensive end-organ damage are not only mediated by the proposed mechanisms that result in hemodynamic injury. Inflammation plays an important role in the pathophysiology and contributes to the deleterious consequences of arterial hypertension. Sodium intake is indispensable for normal body function but can be detrimental when it exceeds dietary requirements. Recent data show that sodium levels also modulate the function of monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, and different T-cell subsets. Some of these effects are mediated by changes in the microbiome and metabolome due to high-salt intake. The purpose of this review is to propose a revised and extended version of the mosaic theory by summarizing and integrating recent advances in salt, immunity, and hypertension research. Salt and inflammation are placed in the middle of the mosaic because both factors influence each of the remaining pieces.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00851-8"

Moreover, even after transplantation, the graft can be lost due to antibody-mediated rejection (AMR). A recent study by Schmitz et al. in Nature Communications [1] provides new hope to prevent AMR and prolong renal allograft survival. The authors inhibited the innate immune complement cascade at the level of its central component C3 and successfully prevented the tissue injury mediated by donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) in a primate model.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00854-5"
"cmi","Avian influenza viruses suppress innate immunity by inducing trans-transcriptional readthrough via SSU72","Innate immunity plays critical antiviral roles. The highly virulent avian influenza viruses (AIVs) H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6 can better escape host innate immune responses than the less virulent seasonal H1N1 virus. Here, we report a mechanism by which transcriptional readthrough (TRT)-mediated suppression of innate immunity occurs post AIV infection. By using cell lines, mouse lungs, and patient PBMCs, we showed that genes on the complementary strand (“trans” genes) influenced by TRT were involved in the disruption of host antiviral responses during AIV infection. The trans-TRT enhanced viral lethality, and TRT abolishment increased cell viability and STAT1/2 expression. The viral NS1 protein directly bound to SSU72, and degradation of SSU72 induced TRT. SSU72 overexpression reduced TRT and alleviated mouse lung injury. Our results suggest that AIVs infection induce TRT by reducing SSU72 expression, thereby impairing host immune responses, a molecular mechanism acting through the NS1-SSU72-trans-TRT-STAT1/2 axis. Thus, restoration of SSU72 expression might be a potential strategy for preventing AIV pandemics.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00843-8"
"cmi","Histones released by NETosis enhance the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 by bridging the spike protein subunit 2 and sialic acid on host cells","Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) can capture and kill viruses, such as influenza viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), thus contributing to host defense. Contrary to our expectation, we show here that the histones released by NETosis enhance the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, as found by using live SARS-CoV-2 and two pseudovirus systems as well as a mouse model. The histone H3 or H4 selectively binds to subunit 2 of the spike (S) protein, as shown by a biochemical binding assay, surface plasmon resonance and binding energy calculation as well as the construction of a mutant S protein by replacing four acidic amino acids. Sialic acid on the host cell surface is the key molecule to which histones bridge subunit 2 of the S protein. Moreover, histones enhance cell-cell fusion. Finally, treatment with an inhibitor of NETosis, histone H3 or H4, or sialic acid notably affected the levels of sgRNA copies and the number of apoptotic cells in a mouse model. These findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 could hijack histones from neutrophil NETosis to promote its host cell attachment and entry process and may be important in exploring pathogenesis and possible strategies to develop new effective therapies for COVID-19.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-022-00845-6"

An emerging area of investigation using the systems biology approach is the study of the metabolism of immune cells. The diverse spectra of immune cell phenotypes, sparsity of immune cell numbers in vivo, limitations in the number of metabolites identified, dynamic nature of cellular metabolism and metabolic fluxes, tissue specificity, and high dependence on the local milieu make investigations in immunometabolism challenging, especially at the single-cell level. In this review, we define the systemic nature of immunometabolism, summarize cell- and system-based approaches, and introduce mathematical modeling approaches for systems interrogation of metabolic changes in immune cells. We close the review by discussing the applications and shortcomings of metabolic modeling techniques. With systems-oriented studies of metabolism expected to become a mainstay of immunological research, an understanding of current approaches toward systems immunometabolism will help investigators make the best use of current resources and push the boundaries of the discipline.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00783-9"
"cmi","Microenvironmental influences on T cell immunity in cancer and inflammation","T cell metabolism is dynamic and highly regulated. While the intrinsic metabolic programs of T cell subsets are integral to their distinct differentiation and functional patterns, the ability of cells to acquire nutrients and cope with hostile microenvironments can limit these pathways. T cells must function in a wide variety of tissue settings, and how T cells interpret these signals to maintain an appropriate metabolic program for their demands or if metabolic mechanisms of immune suppression restrain immunity is an area of growing importance. Both in inflamed and cancer tissues, a wide range of changes in physical conditions and nutrient availability are now acknowledged to shape immunity. These include fever and increased temperatures, depletion of critical micro and macro-nutrients, and accumulation of inhibitory waste products. Here we review several of these factors and how the tissue microenvironment both shapes and constrains immunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00833-2"

Chronic inflammation is characterized by persistent, low-grade inflammation and is increased in the aging population. Neutrophils are normally the first responders to acute inflammation and contribute to the resolution of inflammation. However, in chronic inflammation, the role of neutrophils is less well understood and has been described as either beneficial or detrimental, causing tissue damage and enhancing the immune response. Emerging evidence suggests that neutrophils are important players in several chronic diseases, such as atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and autoimmune disorders. This review will highlight the interaction of neutrophils with other cells in the context of chronic inflammation, the contribution of neutrophils to selected chronic inflammatory diseases, and possible future therapeutic strategies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00832-3"
"cmi","Reprogramming cholesterol metabolism in macrophages and its role in host defense against cholesterol-dependent cytolysins","Cholesterol is a critical lipid for all mammalian cells, ensuring proper membrane integrity, fluidity, and biochemical function. Accumulating evidence indicates that macrophages rapidly and profoundly reprogram their cholesterol metabolism in response to activation signals to support host defense processes. However, our understanding of the molecular details underlying how and why cholesterol homeostasis is specifically reshaped during immune responses remains less well understood. This review discusses our current knowledge of cellular cholesterol homeostatic machinery and introduces emerging concepts regarding how plasma membrane cholesterol is partitioned into distinct pools. We then discuss how proinflammatory signals can markedly reshape the cholesterol metabolism of macrophages, with a focus on the differences between MyD88-dependent pattern recognition receptors and the interferon signaling pathway. We also discuss recent work investigating the capacity of these proinflammatory signals to selectively reshape plasma membrane cholesterol homeostasis. We examine how these changes in plasma membrane cholesterol metabolism influence sensitivity to a set of microbial pore-forming toxins known as cholesterol-dependent cytolysins that specifically target cholesterol for their effector functions. We also discuss whether lipid metabolic reprogramming can be leveraged for therapy to mitigate tissue damage mediated by cholesterol-dependent cytolysins in necrotizing fasciitis and other related infections. We expect that advancing our understanding of the crosstalk between metabolism and innate immunity will help explain how inflammation underlies metabolic diseases and highlight pathways that could be targeted to normalize metabolic homeostasis in disease states.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00827-0"
"cmi","Negative elongation factor: a key factor in the maintenance of intestinal epithelial barrier integrity","In addition to its physiological function in the uptake of dietary nutrients, the intestinal epithelium constitutes an essential mechanical barrier separating luminal gut content and mucosal microbiota from the inner body. Intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) comprise the frontline of this barrier, the maintenance of which critically depends on the expression of cell-cell junction protein structures, including tight junctions, adherence junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions, which physically bridge and seal the intercellular niche within the IEC layer. Consequently, to fulfill their function as cellular gatekeepers in the gut, high basal transcriptional activity of gene loci in IEC that encode cell junction proteins needs to be ensured at all times. Aberrant transcriptional regulation of barrier-related genes has been reported in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (reviewed in refs. [1, 2]). Indeed, the resulting intestinal barrier breakdown entails fatal immune activation due to facilitated translocation of microbiota and inflammatory microbial constituents across the epithelial layer. Previous studies have addressed the transcriptional regulation of cell junction proteins by transcription factors (e.g., [beta]-Catenin-TCF/LEF, HNF-4a, Cdx2, Cdx1, GATA4, Slug and Snail) [3,4,5,6] as well as the epigenetic regulation of promoter chromatin accessibility via histone modifications in some detail [7]. However, our knowledge regarding the transcriptional regulation of cell junction proteins by the transcript elongation machinery promoting and fine-tuning RNA polymerase II (PolII) activity is limited. Negative elongation factor (NELF) together with DRB sensitivity-inducing factor (DSIF) are both thought to prevent transcription elongation of PolII-transcribed gene loci [8] based on the so-called promoter-proximal pause/release concept [9]. However, current findings imply that NELF, within early elongation complexes, affects transcription independent of the RNA Pol II pause/release model [10].","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00817-2"

However, the specific factors influencing individual clinical outcomes remain unclear. Thus, to characterize the versatile interplay of mucosal and systemic immune responses with the local microbiome and the viral load, as well as its impact on the course of the disease, Smith et al. performed integrated analyses of nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma samples from COVID-19 patients with varying degrees of illness severity. They observed that spike-specific neutralizing antibodies were heterogeneous between paired plasma samples and nasopharyngeal swabs from individual SARS-CoV-2 patients, suggesting a tissue-dependent regulation of humoral immune responses. Their study also confirmed that systemic inflammatory responses were associated with viral load. Interestingly, dysbiosis of the local microbiota and an accumulation of (facultative) pathogenic bacteria in the nasopharynx, frequently reported in secondary respiratory infections, were linked to mucosal inflammation and severe COVID-19. Conversely, the levels of cytokines, including IL-33 and different interferons that might be important for viral control, were reduced. Thus, Smith et al. revealed the nasopharyngeal microbiome as a novel player influencing local and systemic immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently the clinical outcome of COVID-19 [1].","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00822-5"
"cmi","A new perspective is needed for positive selection of germinal center B cells with higher-affinity B cell receptors","In a recent issue of Nature Immunology, Chen et al. identified differential expression signatures of metabolic programs within the germinal center (GC) compartment to distinguish GC B cells from different zones [1]. Furthermore, they identified an important role of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in the process of positive selection of B cells with higher-affinity B cell receptors (BCRs) in GCs. GCs are inducible secondary lymphoid microanatomical structures that provide niches for B cells to capture and present antigens in the light zone (LZ) and to undergo clonal expansion and BCR somatic hypermutation (SHM) in the dark zone (DZ) Fig. 1. Alternating migration of activated GC B cells between the LZ and DZ is assumed to result in positive selection of clones with higher-affinity B cell antigen receptors. These clones are characterized by accelerated cell division, suggesting a genomic program activated by BCR and CD40 signaling [2]. Although GC B cells of the LZ have been suggested to rely primarily on glycolysis due to the hypoxic nature of the LZ niche, isolated GC B cells demonstrated an oxidative phenotype in vitro [3]. Chen et al. recently reported that GC B cells require OXPHOS activity not only for their clonal expansion but also, and at least as importantly, for efficient positive selection of high-affinity BCR-expressing GC B cell clones in the DZ. The researchers also first described a link between switching of the GC B cell metabolic profile, cell cycle control, cell expansion, and positive selection of cells with high-affinity B cell receptors. These observations clearly underline that cellular energy metabolism is an important part of the background machinery that ensures the proper functioning of immune cells (here, GC B cells)-a view that is more than 20 years old [4].","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00823-4"
"cmi","MCMV-based vaccine vectors expressing full-length viral proteins provide long-term humoral immune protection upon a single-shot vaccination","Global pandemics caused by influenza or coronaviruses cause severe disruptions to public health and lead to high morbidity and mortality. There remains a medical need for vaccines against these pathogens. CMV (cytomegalovirus) is a [beta]-herpesvirus that induces uniquely robust immune responses in which remarkably large populations of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are maintained for a lifetime. Hence, CMV has been proposed and investigated as a novel vaccine vector for expressing antigenic peptides or proteins to elicit protective cellular immune responses against numerous pathogens. We generated two recombinant murine CMV (MCMV) vaccine vectors expressing hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus (MCMVHA) or the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (MCMVS). A single injection of MCMVs expressing either viral protein induced potent neutralizing antibody responses, which strengthened over time. Importantly, MCMVHA-vaccinated mice were protected from illness following challenge with the influenza virus, and we excluded that this protection was due to the effects of memory T cells. Conclusively, we show here that MCMV vectors induce not only long-term cellular immunity but also humoral responses that provide long-term immune protection against clinically relevant respiratory pathogens.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00814-5"

While some variants spread only locally, others, referred to as variants of concern, disseminated globally and became drivers of the pandemic. All SARS-CoV-2 variants harbor mutations relative to the virus circulating early in the pandemic, and mutations in the viral spike (S) protein are considered of particular relevance since the S protein mediates host cell entry and constitutes the key target of the neutralizing antibody response. As a consequence, mutations in the S protein may increase SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and enable its evasion of neutralizing antibodies.

Furthermore, multiple emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants have shown enhanced infectivity, transmissibility, pathogenicity and ability to escape neutralization by vaccine-induced humoral immunity [1]. The antibody resistance of SARS-CoV-2 variants constitutes a challenge for current vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. No specific antiviral is currently available for coronavirus in humans [2]. Although remdesivir was approved by the FDA for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the therapeutic effect is limited, particularly for critical cases with severe pneumonia.

Here, we describe the pro-tumorigenic roles of lipid uptake, metabolism and synthesis and detail the therapeutic potential of targeting lipid metabolism in cancer. Additionally, we highlight new insights into the distinct immunosuppressive effects of lipids in the tumour microenvironment. Lipids threaten an anti-tumour environment whereby metabolic adaptation to lipid metabolism is linked to immune dysfunction. Finally, we describe the differential effects of commondietary lipids on cancer growth which may uncover a role for specific dietary regimens in association with traditional cancer therapies. Understanding the relationship between dietary lipids, tumour, and immune cells is important in the context of obesity which may reveal a possibility to harness the diet in the treatment of cancers.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00781-x"

Plant-derived virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidates have previously demonstrated immunogenicity and efficacy against influenza. Here, we report the immunogenicity and protection induced in rhesus macaques by intramuscular injections of a VLP bearing a SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (CoVLP) vaccine candidate formulated with or without Adjuvant System 03 (AS03) or cytidine-phospho-guanosine (CpG) 1018. Although a single dose of the unadjuvanted CoVLP vaccine candidate stimulated humoral and cell-mediated immune responses, booster immunization (at 28 days after priming) and adjuvant administration significantly improved both responses, with higher immunogenicity and protection provided by the AS03-adjuvanted CoVLP. Fifteen micrograms of CoVLP adjuvanted with AS03 induced a polyfunctional interleukin-2 (IL-2)-driven response and IL-4 expression in CD4 T cells. Animals were challenged by multiple routes (i.e., intratracheal, intranasal, and ocular) with a total viral dose of 106 plaque-forming units of SARS-CoV-2. Lower viral replication in nasal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as well as fewer SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and immune cell infiltrates in the lungs concomitant with reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemotactic factors in the BALF were observed in animals immunized with the CoVLP adjuvanted with AS03. No clinical, pathologic, or virologic evidence of vaccine-associated enhanced disease was observed in vaccinated animals. The CoVLP adjuvanted with AS03 was therefore selected for vaccine development and clinical trials.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00809-2"
"cmi","Conventional type 1 dendritic cells protect against age-related adipose tissue dysfunction and obesity","Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) scan and integrate environmental cues in almost every tissue, including exogenous metabolic signals. While cDCs are critical in maintaining immune balance, their role in preserving energy homeostasis is unclear. Here, we showed that Batf3-deficient mice lacking conventional type 1 DCs (cDC1s) had increased body weight and adiposity during aging. This led to impaired energy expenditure and glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and liver steatosis. cDC1 deficiency caused adipose tissue inflammation that was preceded by a paucity of NK1.1+ invariant NKT (iNKT) cells. Accordingly, among antigen-presenting cells, cDC1s exhibited notable induction of IFN-[gamma] production by iNKT cells, which plays a metabolically protective role in lean adipose tissue. Flt3L treatment, which expands the dendritic cell (DC) compartment, mitigated diet-induced obesity and hyperlipidemia in a Batf3-dependent manner. This effect was partially mediated by NK1.1+ cells. These results reveal a new critical role for the cDC1-iNKT cell axis in the regulation of adipose tissue homeostasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00812-7"
"cmi","The transcription factor KLF14 regulates macrophage glycolysis and immune function by inhibiting HK2 in sepsis","Sepsis is a heterogeneous syndrome induced by a dysregulated host response to infection. Glycolysis plays a role in maintaining the immune function of macrophages, which is crucial for severely septic patients. However, how the pathways that link glycolysis and macrophages are regulated is still largely unknown. Here, we provide evidence to support the function of KLF14, a novel Krüppel-like transcription factor, in the regulation of glycolysis and the immune function of macrophages during sepsis. KLF14 deletion led to significantly increased mortality in lethal models of murine endotoxemia and sepsis. Mechanistically, KLF14 decreased glycolysis and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines by macrophages by inhibiting the transcription of HK2. In addition, we confirmed that the expression of KLF14 was upregulated in septic patients. Furthermore, pharmacological activation of KLF14 conferred protection against sepsis in mice. These findings uncover a key role of KLF14 in modulating the inflammatory signaling pathway and shed light on the development of KLF14-targeted therapeutics for sepsis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00806-5"
"cmi","SARS-CoV-2 treatment effects induced by ACE2-expressing microparticles are explained by the oxidized cholesterol-increased endosomal pH of alveolar macrophages","Exploring the cross-talk between the immune system and advanced biomaterials to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection is a promising strategy. Here, we show that ACE2-overexpressing A549 cell-derived microparticles (AO-MPs) are a potential therapeutic agent against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Intranasally administered AO-MPs dexterously navigate the anatomical and biological features of the lungs to enter the alveoli and are taken up by alveolar macrophages (AMs). Then, AO-MPs increase the endosomal pH but decrease the lysosomal pH in AMs, thus escorting bound SARS-CoV-2 from phago-endosomes to lysosomes for degradation. This pH regulation is attributable to oxidized cholesterol, which is enriched in AO-MPs and translocated to endosomal membranes, thus interfering with proton pumps and impairing endosomal acidification. In addition to promoting viral degradation, AO-MPs also inhibit the proinflammatory phenotype of AMs, leading to increased treatment efficacy in a SARS-CoV-2-infected mouse model without side effects. These findings highlight the potential use of AO-MPs to treat SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and showcase the feasibility of MP therapies for combatting emerging respiratory viruses in the future.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00813-6"

Here, we unveiled the guiding role of three essential factors, Lhx2, Hoxa9, and Runx1, the simultaneous expression of which preferentially drives B lineage fate commitment and in vivo B lymphopoiesis using PSCs as a cell source. In the presence of Lhx2, Hoxa9, and Runx1 expression, PSC-derived induced hematopoietic progenitors (iHPCs) immediately gave rise to pro/pre-B cells in recipient bone marrow, which were able to further differentiate into entire B cell lineages, including innate B-1a, B-1b, and marginal zone B cells, as well as adaptive follicular B cells. In particular, the regenerative B cells produced adaptive humoral immune responses, sustained antigen-specific antibody production, and formed immune memory in response to antigen challenges. The regenerative B cells showed natural B cell development patterns of immunoglobulin chain switching and hypermutation via cross-talk with host T follicular helper cells, which eventually formed T cell-dependent humoral responses. This study exhibits de novo evidence that B lymphopoiesis can be regenerated from PSCs via an HSC-independent approach, which provides insights into treating B cell-related deficiencies using PSCs as an unlimited cell resource.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00805-6"

The emerging field of immunometabolism highlights the importance of cellular metabolism for the maintenance and activities of immune cells. Macrophages are embryo- or adult bone marrow-derived leukocytes that are key for healthy tissue homeostasis but can also contribute to pathologies such as metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, fibrosis or cancer. Macrophage metabolism has largely been studied in vitro. However, different organs contain diverse macrophage populations that specialize in distinct and often tissue-specific functions. This context specificity creates diverging metabolic challenges for tissue macrophage populations to fulfill their homeostatic roles in their particular microenvironment and conditions their response in pathological conditions.

"cmi","Resident and migratory adipose immune cells control systemic metabolism and thermogenesis","Glucose is a vital source of energy for all mammals. The balance between glucose uptake, metabolism and storage determines the energy status of an individual, and perturbations in this balance can lead to metabolic diseases. The maintenance of organismal glucose metabolism is a complex process that involves multiple tissues, including adipose tissue, which is an endocrine and energy storage organ that is critical for the regulation of systemic metabolism. Adipose tissue consists of an array of different cell types, including specialized adipocytes and stromal and endothelial cells. In addition, adipose tissue harbors a wide range of immune cells that play vital roles in adipose tissue homeostasis and function. These cells contribute to the regulation of systemic metabolism by modulating the inflammatory tone of adipose tissue, which is directly linked to insulin sensitivity and signaling. Furthermore, these cells affect the control of thermogenesis. While lean adipose tissue is rich in type 2 and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, obesity tips the balance in favor of a proinflammatory milieu, leading to the development of insulin resistance and the dysregulation of systemic metabolism. Notably, anti-inflammatory immune cells, including regulatory T cells and innate lymphocytes, protect against insulin resistance and have the characteristics of tissue-resident cells, while proinflammatory immune cells are recruited from the circulation to obese adipose tissue. Here, we review the key findings that have shaped our understanding of how immune cells regulate adipose tissue homeostasis to control organismal metabolism.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00804-7"

Recent studies have preliminarily described the safety and immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and in liver transplant recipients [4, 5]. However, to date, there is no detailed information on the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection. It has been reported that CHB patients have impaired immune systems [6]. Hence, whether immunocompromised CHB patients within the different clinical stages can be safely vaccinated with the various types of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and produce an effective immune response remains unclear.

Lectins such as sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 1 (Siglec-1/CD169) mediate the attachment of viruses to APCs. Here, we show that APCs effectively capture SARS-CoV-2 within compartments via recognition of Siglec-1. This receptor interacts with sialylated gangliosides on membranes of SARS-CoV-2 variants, as previously shown for retroviruses or filoviruses [1]. Blockage of Siglec-1 on monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) decreased SARS-CoV-2 viral transfer or trans-infection to bystander target cells. However, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) capturing SARS-CoV-2 via Siglec-1 did not transmit infectious particles.

IL-12 family members are generally heterodimers and share three [alpha]-subunits (p35, p19, and p28) and two [beta]-subunits (p40 and EBI3). However, a [beta]-sheet p40 homodimer has been shown to exist and antagonize IL-12 and IL-23 signaling 1. Therefore, we assumed the existence of a p40-EBI3 heterodimer in nature and sought to investigate its role in immune regulation.MethodsThe presence of the p40-EBI3 heterodimer was confirmed by ELISA, immunoprecipitation, and western blotting. A p40-EBI3 vector and p40-EBI3-Fc protein were synthesized to confirm the immunological role of this protein in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). The anti-inflammatory effects of p40-EBI3 were analyzed with regard to clinical, histological, and immune cell-regulating features in mice with CIA.ResultsClinical arthritis scores and the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-17, IL-1[beta], IL-6, and TNF-[alpha]) were significantly attenuated in p40-EBI3-overexpressing and p40-EBI3-Fc-treated mice with CIA compared to vehicle-treated mice with CIA. Structural joint damage and vessel formation-related gene expression were also reduced by p40-EBI3 heterodimer treatment. In vitro, the p40-EBI3-Fc protein significantly suppressed the differentiation of Th17 cells and reciprocally induced CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ (regulatory T) cells. p40-EBI3 also inhibited osteoclast formation in a concentration-dependent manner.ConclusionIn this study, p40-EBI3 ameliorated proinflammatory conditions both in vivo and in vitro. We propose that p40-EBI3 is a novel anti-inflammatory cytokine involved in suppressing the immune response through the expansion of Treg cells and suppression of Th17 cells and osteoclastogenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00798-2"
"cmi","Homeoprotein SIX1 compromises antitumor immunity through TGF-[beta]-mediated regulation of collagens","The tumor microenvironment (TME), including infiltrated immune cells, is known to play an important role in tumor growth; however, the mechanisms underlying tumor immunogenicity have not been fully elucidated. Here, we discovered an unexpected role for the transcription factor SIX1 in regulating the tumor immune microenvironment. Based on analyses of patient datasets, we found that SIX1 was upregulated in human tumor tissues and that its expression levels were negatively correlated with immune cell infiltration in the TME and the overall survival rates of cancer patients. Deletion of Six1 in cancer cells significantly reduced tumor growth in an immune-dependent manner with enhanced antitumor immunity in the TME. Mechanistically, SIX1 was required for the expression of multiple collagen genes via the TGFBR2-dependent Smad2/3 activation pathway, and collagen deposition in the TME hampered immune cell infiltration and activation. Thus, our study uncovers a crucial role for SIX1 in modulating tumor immunogenicity and provides proof-of-concept evidence for targeting SIX1 in cancer immunotherapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00800-x"
"cmi","Supplying the trip to antibody production-nutrients, signaling, and the programming of cellular metabolism in the mature B lineage","The COVID pandemic has refreshed and expanded recognition of the vital role that sustained antibody (Ab) secretion plays in our immune defenses against microbes and of the importance of vaccines that elicit Ab protection against infection. With this backdrop, it is especially timely to review aspects of the molecular programming that govern how the cells that secrete Abs arise, persist, and meet the challenge of secreting vast amounts of these glycoproteins. Whereas plasmablasts and plasma cells (PCs) are the primary sources of secreted Abs, the process leading to the existence of these cell types starts with naive B lymphocytes that proliferate and differentiate toward several potential fates. At each step, cells reside in specific microenvironments in which they not only receive signals from cytokines and other cell surface receptors but also draw on the interstitium for nutrients. Nutrients in turn influence flux through intermediary metabolism and sensor enzymes that regulate gene transcription, translation, and metabolism. This review will focus on nutrient supply and how sensor mechanisms influence distinct cellular stages that lead to PCs and their adaptations as factories dedicated to Ab secretion. Salient findings of this group and others, sometimes exhibiting differences, will be summarized with regard to the journey to a distinctive metabolic program in PCs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00782-w"
"cmi","CD98-induced CD147 signaling stabilizes the Foxp3 protein to maintain tissue homeostasis","Regulatory T cell (Treg) stability is necessary for the proper control of immune activity and tissue homeostasis. However, it remains unclear whether Treg stability must be continually reinforced or is established during development under physiological conditions. Foxp3 has been characterized as a central mediator of the genetic program that governs Treg stability. Here, we demonstrate that to maintain Foxp3 protein expression, Tregs require cell-to-cell contact, which is mediated by the CD147-CD98 interaction. As Tregs are produced, CD147, which is expressed on their surface, is stimulated by CD98, which is widely expressed in the physiological environment. As a result, CD147's intracellular domain binds to CDK2 and retains it near the membrane, leading to Foxp3 dephosphorylation and the prevention of Foxp3 degradation. In addition, the optimal distribution of Foxp3+ Tregs under both pathological and physiological conditions depends on CD98 expression. Thus, our study provides direct evidence that Foxp3-dependent Treg stability is reinforced in the periphery by the interaction between CD147 and CD98 in the surrounding environment. More importantly, Tregs with high CD147 expression effectively inhibit inflammatory responses and maintain Foxp3 stability, which has guiding significance for the application of Tregs in immunotherapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00785-7"
"cmi","Autophagy takes the STING out of DNA sensing","The innate immune system has evolved to detect molecular signatures associated with invading microbes and the cellular damage these microbes cause. Recognition of microbial genomes, particularly those of intracellular microbes such as viruses, is crucial in triggering a protective response and preventing infection. Many nucleic acid forms are uniquely associated with pathogens (e.g., 5'ppp-RNA, dsRNA) or localize in abnormal cellular compartments during infection (e.g., cytosolic DNA), facilitating the distinction between self and nonself [1]. In particular, the detection of cytosolic DNA has emerged as an important process in infection, as well as cancer, sterile inflammation, and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in which self-DNA induces type I interferon (IFN) signaling and increases the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although it has been known for decades that foreign DNA activates potent immune responses [2], only recently have we started to identify the proteins that are responsible for these responses and how they work [3]. A crucial molecule in this process is stimulator of interferon genes (STING), an ER/Golgi-resident protein that recognizes cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), the product of the activated DNA-binding enzyme cGAMP synthase (cGAS). Activation of STING results in a potent transcriptional response involving IFN and multiple inflammatory genes. To ensure that immune responses are proportionate and can eliminate the exogenous challenge without inducing excessive immunopathology, a fine balance between activation and deactivation must be maintained [4]. Writing in Cellular & Molecular Immunology, Hou et al. [5]. revealed how activated STING is delivered for degradation by the autophagic cargo receptor CCDC50, illuminating the mechanisms that control STING turnover and regulate immune responses to infection and chronic autoimmune disease (Fig. 1).Fig. 1The role of CCDC50 in suppressing the IFN-mediated immune response. Foreign nucleic acids trigger a potent immune response characterized by the production of inflammatory mediators, including type I interferon (IFN). Foreign RNA is recognized by RNA immune sensors such as retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5). Cytosolic DNA can be recognized by cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), which in turn activates stimulator of IFN genes (STING). Signal transduction from these sensors converges to activate the immune transcription factors IFN responsive factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor [kappa]-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-[kappa]B). These transcription factors drive the expression of hundreds of genes, including cytokines and chemokines and their modulators, immunoreceptors and stress response genes. Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 50 (CCDC50) is an autophagic cargo receptor that directs polyubiquitin-activated STING, RIG-I, and MDA5 toward nucleated phagophores and drives their autophagic degradation. This negative regulation results in reductions in IFN and innate responsesFull size image","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00797-3"
"cmi","Screening HLA-A-restricted T cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 and the induction of CD8+ T cell responses in HLA-A transgenic mice","Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific T cells have been found to play essential roles in host immune protection and pathology in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), this study focused on the functional validation of T cell epitopes and the development of vaccines that induce specific T cell responses. A total of 120 CD8+ T cell epitopes from the E, M, N, S, and RdRp proteins were functionally validated. Among these, 110, 15, 6, 14, and 12 epitopes were highly homologous with SARS-CoV, OC43, NL63, HKU1, and 229E, respectively; in addition, four epitopes from the S protein displayed one amino acid that was distinct from the current SARS-CoV-2 variants. Then, 31 epitopes restricted by the HLA-A2 molecule were used to generate peptide cocktail vaccines in combination with Poly(I:C), R848 or poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoparticles, and these vaccines elicited robust and specific CD8+ T cell responses in HLA-A2/DR1 transgenic mice as well as wild-type mice. In contrast to previous research, this study established a modified DC-peptide-PBL cell coculture system using healthy donor PBMCs to validate the in silico predicted epitopes, provided an epitope library restricted by nine of the most prevalent HLA-A allotypes covering broad Asian populations, and identified the HLA-A restrictions of these validated epitopes using competitive peptide binding experiments with HMy2.CIR cell lines expressing the indicated HLA-A allotype, which initially confirmed the in vivo feasibility of 9- or 10-mer peptide cocktail vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. These data will facilitate the design and development of vaccines that induce antiviral CD8+ T cell responses in COVID-19 patients.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00784-8"
"cmi","The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 variant A.30 is heavily mutated and evades vaccine-induced antibodies with high efficiency","The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, continues to rage in many countries, straining health systems and economies. Vaccines protect against severe disease and death and are considered central to ending the pandemic. COVID-19 vaccines (and SARS-CoV-2 infection) elicit antibodies that are directed against the viral spike (S) protein and neutralize the virus. However, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with S protein mutations that confer resistance to neutralization might compromise vaccine efficacy [1]. Furthermore, emerging viral variants with enhanced transmissibility, likely due to altered virus-host cell interactions, might rapidly spread globally. Therefore, it is important to investigate whether emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants exhibit altered host cell interactions and resistance against antibody-mediated neutralization.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00779-5"
"cmi","Impact of intracellular innate immune receptors on immunometabolism","Immunometabolism, which is the metabolic reprogramming of anaerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and metabolite synthesis upon immune cell activation, has gained importance as a regulator of the homeostasis, activation, proliferation, and differentiation of innate and adaptive immune cell subsets that function as key factors in immunity. Metabolic changes in epithelial and other stromal cells in response to different stimulatory signals are also crucial in infection, inflammation, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disorders. The crosstalk between the PI3K-AKT-mTOR and LKB1-AMPK signaling pathways is critical for modulating both immune and nonimmune cell metabolism. The bidirectional interaction between immune cells and metabolism is a topic of intense study. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytokine receptors, and T and B cell receptors have been shown to activate multiple downstream metabolic pathways. However, how intracellular innate immune sensors/receptors intersect with metabolic pathways is less well understood. The goal of this review is to examine the link between immunometabolism and the functions of several intracellular innate immune sensors or receptors, such as nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NLRs, or NOD-like receptors), absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-like receptors (ALRs), and the cyclic dinucleotide receptor stimulator of interferon genes (STING). We will focus on recent advances and describe the impact of these intracellular innate immune receptors on multiple metabolic pathways. Whenever appropriate, this review will provide a brief contextual connection to pathogenic infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, metabolic disorders, and/or inflammatory bowel diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00780-y"

As the humoral immune response plays essential roles in disease occurrence and development, understanding the dynamics and characteristics of virus-specific humoral immunity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients is of great importance for controlling this disease. In this review, we summarize the characteristics of the humoral immune response after SARS-CoV-2 infection and further emphasize the potential applications and therapeutic prospects of SARS-CoV-2-specific humoral immunity and the critical role of this immunity in vaccine development. Notably, serological antibody testing based on the humoral immune response can guide public health measures and control strategies; however, it is not recommended for population surveys in areas with very low prevalence. Existing evidence suggests that asymptomatic individuals have a weaker immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas SARS-CoV-2-infected children have a more effective humoral immune response than adults. The correlations between antibody (especially neutralizing antibody) titers and protection against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection should be further examined. In addition, the emergence of cross-reactions among different coronavirus antigens in the development of screening technology and the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement related to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination should be given further attention.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00774-w"

Neutralizing antibodies are produced upon vaccination or infection; for the latter, it is known that levels correlate with the duration and severity of clinical symptoms [5].

"cmi","The blood-brain barrier in systemic infection and inflammation","The vascular blood-brain barrier is a highly regulated interface between the blood and brain. Its primary function is to protect central neurons while signaling the presence of systemic inflammation and infection to the brain to enable a protective sickness behavior response. With increasing degrees and duration of systemic inflammation, the vascular blood-brain barrier becomes more permeable to solutes, undergoes an increase in lymphocyte trafficking, and is infiltrated by innate immune cells; endothelial cell damage may occasionally occur. Perturbation of neuronal function results in the clinical features of encephalopathy. Here, the molecular and cellular anatomy of the vascular blood-brain barrier is reviewed, first in a healthy context and second in a systemic inflammatory context. Distinct from the molecular and cellular mediators of the blood-brain barrier's response to inflammation, several moderators influence the direction and magnitude at genetic, system, cellular and molecular levels. These include sex, genetic background, age, pre-existing brain pathology, systemic comorbidity, and gut dysbiosis. Further progress is required to define and measure mediators and moderators of the blood-brain barrier's response to systemic inflammation in order to explain the heterogeneity observed in animal and human studies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00757-x"

"cmi","HBeAg induces liver sinusoidal endothelial cell activation to promote intrahepatic CD8 T cell immunity and HBV clearance","It is believed that the inherent tolerogenic property of the liver is involved in the chronicity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection [1]. However, exposure to HBV in adults usually leads to spontaneous clearance of the virus and the induction of potent and effective anti-HBV T cell immunity in the liver [2], suggesting that the immune microenvironment of the liver switches from limiting to allowing effector T cell responses during acute resolution of HBV infection. To date, it remains largely unknown how the immune microenvironment of the liver is regulated and by which mechanism a favorable intrahepatic anti-HBV T cell response is generated in an infected individual. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) play key roles in intrahepatic immune surveillance against infection by regulating the activation of local immune cells [3]. We have previously demonstrated that LSECs switch from a tolerogenic to an immunogenic state and trigger cytotoxic effector CD8 T cell activation under inflammatory conditions [4, 5]. Here, we investigated whether LSECs exhibit plasticity and switch from a tolerogenic to an immunogenic state upon HBV exposure.We first analyzed LSEC-mediated T cell suppression during the course of acute resolution of HBV replication using the HBV hydrodynamic injection (HDI) mouse model. LSECs were freshly purified at 14 days post injection (dpi) and cocultured with T cell receptor (TCR)-activated T cells (Fig. 1A). These T cells produced significantly higher levels of IFN[gamma] than those cocultured with control LSECs (Fig. 1A). LSECs from HBV HDI mice also showed less suppression of CD8 T cell proliferation than LSECs from control mice (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that the ability of LSECs to suppress T cell activation was abolished in HBV HDI mice at 14 dpi. Next, we examined whether exposure to specific HBV antigens altered the ability of LSECs to suppress T cell activation. Our data showed that in vitro pretreatment of LSECs with recombinant HBeAg (rHBeAg) completely abolished the suppression of T cell IFN[gamma] production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Activated T cells cocultured with LSECs exposed to HBeAg in vivo also showed significantly increased IFN[gamma] production compared with those cocultured with control LSECs (Fig. 1B). Moreover, CD3/CD28 Dynabead-activated human PBMCs cocultured with rHBeAg-pretreated human LSECs produced significantly higher amounts of IFN[gamma] than PBMCs cultured with control LSECs (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that HBeAg stimulation could abrogate LSEC-mediated T cell suppression in both mice and humans.Fig. 1: HBeAg induces liver sinusoidal endothelial cell activation to promote intrahepatic CD8 T cell immunity and HBV clearance.A LSECs from mice that were hydrodynamically injected with pSM2 plasmid (HBV) or PBS (HDI Ctrl) were isolated 14 days postinjection (dpi) and cocultured with polyclonally stimulated splenocytes at a ratio of 1:2 (LSECs: splenocytes). Anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated splenocytes were used as a responder control (RC). Unstimulated splenocytes were used as a negative control (NC). IFN[gamma] production was measured after 48 h. CFSE-labeled polyclonally stimulated splenocytes were cocultured with LSECs, and after 72 h, CD8 T cell proliferation was analyzed by flow cytometry. B Naïve mouse or primary human LSECs were treated with recombinant HBeAg (rHBeAg) or left untreated (Ctrl) for 24 h, washed and cocultured with polyclonally stimulated splenocytes or PBMCs at a ratio of 1:2. LSECs from mice that were hydrodynamically injected with pcDNA3.1/HBeAg or the pcDNA3.1/null plasmid at 2 dpi were isolated and cocultured with polyclonally stimulated splenocytes at a ratio of 1:2. IFN[gamma] production was measured after 48 h. Anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated splenocytes were used as a responder control (RC). Unstimulated splenocytes were used as a negative control (NC). C LSECs from naïve mice were mock-treated or treated with rHBeAg, and total RNA was extracted from the cells 6 h later for RNA-seq analysis.

D Supernatants of rHBeAg-LSECs or HBV-LSECs were analyzed for TNF [alpha] and IL-27. E Polyclonally stimulated splenocytes were cocultured with rHBeAg-LSECs or HBV-LSECs, and then 10 [mu]g/ml anti-IL-27 Abs (aIL-27) or anti-TNF[alpha] Abs (aTNF[alpha]) were added to the cocultures, with untreated cocultures as the control (Ctrl). IFN[gamma] production was measured by ELISA after 48 h. F Polyclonally stimulated splenocytes were cocultured with LSECs from naïve mice, and 50 ng/ml rIL-27 or 100 ng/ml rTNF[alpha] was added to the cocultures. IFN[gamma] production was measured by ELISA after 48 h. Anti-CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated splenocytes only were used as a responder controls (RC). Unstimulated splenocytes were used as a negative control (NC). Unpaired t-test or one-way ANOVA is used. Error bars, mean +/- SEM; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.Full size imageTo further examine the possible mechanisms by which HBeAg-exposed LSECs (HBeAg-LSECs) regulate T cell activation, HBeAg-LSECs and unstimulated control LSECs (Ctrl-LSECs) were subjected to transcriptome RNA sequencing analysis (Fig. S1A-C). The pathway functional enrichment of coexpressed DEGs analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that gene sets associated with the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and TNF signaling pathway were enriched in HBeAg-LSECs (Fig. 1C), among which the most upregulated gene was IL27 (~613-fold increase), and the TNF signaling pathway exhibited the maximum enriched ratio (Figs. 1C and S1D). Collectively, these data suggest that HBeAg-LSECs induce T cell activation by producing cytokines. This result was further confirmed by the observation that the transfer of HBeAg-LSEC supernatants into cocultures of activated T cells and untreated LSECs significantly increased IFN[gamma] production by activated T cells (Fig. S1E). Next, we examined the roles of TNF and IL27 in HBeAg-LSEC-induced T cell immunity. Significantly increased amounts of TNF and IL27 were measured in the supernatant of HBeAg-LSECs after 24 h of in vitro stimulation or LSECs purified from HBV HDI mice compared with those produced by the corresponding Ctrl-LSECs (Figs. 1D and S2A, B). TNF or IL27 blockade significantly abrogated IFN[gamma] production by activated T cells cocultured with HBeAg-LSECs or LSECs from HBV HDI mice (Figs. 1E and S2C, D). In contrast, adding recombinant TNF or IL27 to cocultures of activated T cells and untreated LSECs significantly increased IFN[gamma] production by activated T cells (Figs. 1F and S2E).Taken together, our study highlights a previously unappreciated role of HBeAg in inducing LSECs to trigger specific T cell activation partially by increasing IL27 and TNF expression and provides a new regulatory mechanism of the intrahepatic immune microenvironment during HBV infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00769-7"

Expanding these principles through continuous basic research may help broaden translational efforts. With this mindset, we focused this review on three threads of basic research directly relating to mechanisms underlying ICT. Specifically, this review covers three aspects of dendritic cell (DC) biology connected with antitumor immune responses but are not specifically oriented toward therapeutic use. First, we review recent advances in the development of the cDC1 subset of DCs, identifying important features distinguishing these cells from other types of DCs. Second, we review the antigen-processing pathway called cross-presentation, which was discovered in the mid-1970s and remains an enigma. This pathway serves an essential in vivo function unique to cDC1s and may be both a physiologic bottleneck and therapeutic target. Finally, we review the longstanding field of helper cells and the related area of DC licensing, in which CD4 T cells influence the strength or quality of CD8 T cell responses.

"cmi","Regulation of antitumor immunity by inflammation-induced epigenetic alterations","Chronic inflammation promotes tumor development, progression, and metastatic dissemination and causes treatment resistance. The accumulation of genetic alterations and loss of normal cellular regulatory processes are not only associated with cancer growth and progression but also result in the expression of tumor-specific and tumor-associated antigens that may activate antitumor immunity. This antagonism between inflammation and immunity and the ability of cancer cells to avoid immune detection affect the course of cancer development and treatment outcomes. While inflammation, particularly acute inflammation, supports T-cell priming, activation, and infiltration into infected tissues, chronic inflammation is mostly immunosuppressive. However, the main mechanisms that dictate the outcome of the inflammation-immunity interplay are not well understood. Recent data suggest that inflammation triggers epigenetic alterations in cancer cells and components of the tumor microenvironment. These alterations can affect and modulate numerous aspects of cancer development, including tumor growth, the metabolic state, metastatic spread, immune escape, and immunosuppressive or immunosupportive leukocyte generation. In this review, we discuss the role of inflammation in initiating epigenetic alterations in immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts, and cancer cells and suggest how and when epigenetic interventions can be combined with immunotherapies to improve therapeutic outcomes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00756-y"

"cmi","Biology and pathology of the uterine microenvironment and its natural killer cells","Tissues are the new frontier of discoveries in immunology. Cells of the immune system are an integral part of tissue physiology and immunity. Determining how immune cells inhabit, housekeep, and defend gut, lung, brain, liver, uterus, and other organs helps revealing the intimate details of tissue physiology and may offer new therapeutic targets to treat pathologies. The uterine microenvironment modulates the development and function of innate lymphoid cells [ILC, largely represented by natural killer (NK) cells], macrophages, T cells, and dendritic cells. These immune cells, in turn, contribute to tissue homeostasis. Regulated by ovarian hormones, the human uterine mucosa (endometrium) undergoes ~400 monthly cycles of breakdown and regeneration from menarche to menopause, with its fibroblasts, glands, blood vessels, and immune cells remodeling the tissue into the transient decidua. Even more transformative changes occur upon blastocyst implantation. Before the placenta is formed, the endometrial glands feed the embryo by histiotrophic nutrition while the uterine spiral arteries are stripped of their endothelial layer and smooth muscle actin. This arterial remodeling is carried out by invading fetal trophoblast and maternal immune cells, chiefly uterine NK (uNK) cells, which also assist fetal growth. The transformed arteries no longer respond to maternal stimuli and meet the increasing demands of the growing fetus. This review focuses on how the everchanging uterine microenvironment affects uNK cells and how uNK cells regulate homeostasis of the decidua, placenta development, and fetal growth. Determining these pathways will help understand the causes of major pregnancy complications.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00739-z"
"cmi","Tissue-specific Tregs in cancer metastasis: opportunities for precision immunotherapy","Decades of advancements in immuno-oncology have enabled the development of current immunotherapies, which provide long-term treatment responses in certain metastatic cancer patients. However, cures remain infrequent, and most patients ultimately succumb to treatment-refractory metastatic disease. Recent insights suggest that tumors at certain organ sites exhibit distinctive response patterns to immunotherapy and can even reduce antitumor immunity within anatomically distant tumors, suggesting the activation of tissue-specific immune tolerogenic mechanisms in some cases of therapy resistance. Specialized immune cells known as regulatory T cells (Tregs) are present within all tissues in the body and coordinate the suppression of excessive immune activation to curb autoimmunity and maintain immune homeostasis. Despite the high volume of research on Tregs, the findings have failed to reconcile tissue-specific Treg functions in organs, such as tolerance, tissue repair, and regeneration, with their suppression of local and systemic tumor immunity in the context of immunotherapy resistance. To improve the understanding of how the tissue-specific functions of Tregs impact cancer immunotherapy, we review the specialized role of Tregs in clinically common and challenging organ sites of cancer metastasis, highlight research that describes Treg impacts on tissue-specific and systemic immune regulation in the context of immunotherapy, and summarize ongoing work reporting clinically feasible strategies that combine the specific targeting of Tregs with systemic cancer immunotherapy. Improved knowledge of Tregs in the framework of their tissue-specific biology and clinical sites of organ metastasis will enable more precise targeting of immunotherapy and have profound implications for treating patients with metastatic cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00742-4"

In patients with COVID-19, CD8+ T cells exhibiting activated phenotypes are commonly observed, although the absolute number of CD8+ T cells is decreased. In addition, several studies have reported an upregulation of inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors, such as PD-1, and the expression of exhaustion-associated gene signatures in CD8+ T cells from patients with COVID-19. However, whether CD8+ T cells are truly exhausted during COVID-19 has been a controversial issue. In the present review, we summarize the current understanding of CD8+ T-cell exhaustion and describe the available knowledge on the phenotypes and functions of CD8+ T cells in the context of activation and exhaustion. We also summarize recent reports regarding phenotypical and functional analyses of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells and discuss long-term SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T-cell memory.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00750-4"
"cmi","Metabolic programming in dendritic cells tailors immune responses and homeostasis","It is being increasingly acknowledged that immune cells depend on certain metabolic traits to perform their functions and that the extracellular environment can influence cell metabolism and vice versa. Dendritic cell (DC) subsets traffic through highly diverse environments from the bone marrow, where they develop, to the various peripheral tissues, where they differentiate and capture antigens, before they migrate to the lymph node to present antigens and prime T cells. It is plausible that DC subsets modulate their stimulatory abilities in response to unique metabolic programming. The metabolic requirements of DCs are just recently being discovered, and subset- and context-specific metabolic phenotypes in DCs are highly intertwined with DC functions. In this review, we present the current knowledge on the intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of DC metabolism, how they regulate DC function with examples from tumor biology and in interaction with the microbiota, and discuss how this can be applied therapeutically.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00753-1"
"cmi","Microglia as hackers of the matrix: sculpting synapses and the extracellular space","Microglia shape the synaptic environment in health and disease, but synapses do not exist in a vacuum. Instead, pre- and postsynaptic terminals are surrounded by extracellular matrix (ECM), which together with glia comprise the four elements of the contemporary tetrapartite synapse model. While research in this area is still just beginning, accumulating evidence points toward a novel role for microglia in regulating the ECM during normal brain homeostasis, and such processes may, in turn, become dysfunctional in disease. As it relates to synapses, microglia are reported to modify the perisynaptic matrix, which is the diffuse matrix that surrounds dendritic and axonal terminals, as well as perineuronal nets (PNNs), specialized reticular formations of compact ECM that enwrap neuronal subsets and stabilize proximal synapses. The interconnected relationship between synapses and the ECM in which they are embedded suggests that alterations in one structure necessarily affect the dynamics of the other, and microglia may need to sculpt the matrix to modify the synapses within. Here, we provide an overview of the microglial regulation of synapses, perisynaptic matrix, and PNNs, propose candidate mechanisms by which these structures may be modified, and present the implications of such modifications in normal brain homeostasis and in disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00751-3"

We generated PD-1 and T cell receptor (TCR) deficient mesothelin-specific CAR-T (MPTK-CAR-T) cells using CRISPR-Cas9 technology and evaluated them in a dose-escalation study. A total of 15 patients received one or more infusions of MPTK-CAR-T cells without prior lymphodepletion. No dose-limiting toxicity or unexpected adverse events were observed in any of the 15 patients. The best overall response was stable disease (2/15 patients). Circulating MPTK-CAR-T cells peaked at days 7-14 and became undetectable beyond 1 month. TCR-positive CAR-T cells rather than TCR-negative CAR-T cells were predominantly detected in effusion or peripheral blood from three patients after infusion. We further confirmed the reduced persistence of TCR-deficient CAR-T cells in animal models. Our results establish the preliminary feasibility and safety of CRISPR-engineered CAR-T cells with PD-1 disruption and suggest that the natural TCR plays an important role in the persistence of CAR-T cells when treating solid tumors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00749-x"
"cmi","Neuron navigator 2 is a novel mediator of rheumatoid arthritis","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease mainly characterized by synovial tumor-like hyperplasia, synovial inflammation, and damage to adjacent cartilage and bones.1 Our previous study provided evidence that cystathionine-[gamma]-lyase (CSE) and the histone demethylase JMJD3 are significantly increased in RA, and CSE was found to negatively regulate the inflammatory response in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs), which was mainly attributed to JMJD3 inhibition, in RA.2 Our recent data provided further novel insight into the molecular mechanism by which the inflammatory response is regulated in RA pathogenesis. As a member of the neuron navigator (NAV) family, NAV2 was reported to be associated with deeper invasion and lymph node and distant metastases in colorectal carcinoma.3 Our latest study provides evidence that NAV2 expression is clearly higher in RA patients. TNF-[alpha] intervention can significantly increase the level of NAV2, promote proliferation and invasion and further trigger the Wnt/[beta]-catenin signaling pathway.

"cmi","The therapeutic implications of immunosuppressive tumor aerobic glycolysis","In 2011, Hanahan and Weinberg added “Deregulating Cellular Energetics” and “Avoiding Immune Destruction” to the six previous hallmarks of cancer. Since this seminal paper, there has been a growing consensus that these new hallmarks are not mutually exclusive but rather interdependent. The following review summarizes how founding genetic events for tumorigenesis ultimately increase tumor cell glycolysis, which not only supports the metabolic demands of malignancy but also provides an immunoprotective niche, promoting malignant cell proliferation, maintenance and progression. The mechanisms by which altered metabolism contributes to immune impairment are multifactorial: (1) the metabolic demands of proliferating tumor cells and activated immune cells are similar, thus creating a situation where immune cells may be in competition for key nutrients; (2) the metabolic byproducts of aerobic glycolysis directly inhibit antitumor immunity while promoting a regulatory immune phenotype; and (3) the gene programs associated with the upregulation of glycolysis also result in the generation of immunosuppressive cytokines and metabolites. From this perspective, we shed light on important considerations for the development of new classes of agents targeting cancer metabolism. These types of therapies can impair tumor growth but also pose a significant risk of stifling antitumor immunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00727-3"
"cmi","c-Met enforces proinflammatory and migratory features of human activated CD4+ T cells","The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met is essential for embryonic development and tissue regeneration, as it promotes cell survival, proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis [1, 2]. The HGF/c-Met axis modulates several inflammatory-mediated diseases by acting on a wide variety of cells [3]. Nevertheless, studies on the role of c-Met in peripheral T cell functions are very limited, partly because we and others have reported negligible c-Met expression in naive T cells [2, 4]. Recently, we found that a fraction of murine cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) expressed c-Met (c-Met+ CTLs). We also demonstrated the presence of c-Met+ CTLs in mouse tumors [5] and central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity models [6]. Interestingly, c-Met+ CTL populations arise only under conditions caused by a pathological microenvironment. Hence, this particular c-Met+ population is barely detectable in tumor-free [5] and naïve (preimmunized) mice [7], suggesting that c-Met+ T cells are able to expand only after activation or in pathological settings. Based on these findings, we wondered whether c-Met expression can be induced on CD4+ T lymphocytes from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon T cell receptor (TCR) triggering.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00721-9"
"cmi","Advances and challenges of mesenchymal stem cells for pregnancy-related diseases","Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with pluripotency, wide origin and strong migration ability, but low immunogenicity and lack of ethical controversies, have been intensely investigated for clinical applications within the last decades. Our previously published data in this issue of Cellular and Molecular Immunology demonstrated that adoptive transfer of MSCs can prevent fetal loss in lipopolysaccharide-induced and spontaneous abortion models via a paracrine effect and a cell contact-dependent manner. MSC-derived TSG-6 promotes the transformation of pro-inflammatory macrophages (M1) to anti-inflammatory ones (M2), as well as inhibits the proliferation and inflammatory response of CD4+ T cells. MSC-M1 contact increases the production of TSG-6 and thus enhances TSG-6-mediated paracrine effect. In addition, CD200 on MSCs interacting with CD200R on M1 played an indispensable role in the transition of M1 to M2 by MSCs. Notably, M1 exerted a promotion effect on the CD200 expression of MSCs. Therefore, soluble factor, TSG-6 cooperates with the MSC-M1 contact, involved in the immunosuppression by MSCs against abortion.1","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00707-7"
"cmi","A DL-4- and TNF[alpha]-based culture system to generate high numbers of nonmodified or genetically modified immunotherapeutic human T-lymphoid progenitors","Several obstacles to the production, expansion and genetic modification of immunotherapeutic T cells in vitro have restricted the widespread use of T-cell immunotherapy. In the context of HSCT, delayed naïve T-cell recovery contributes to poor outcomes. A novel approach to overcome the major limitations of both T-cell immunotherapy and HSCT would be to transplant human T-lymphoid progenitors (HTLPs), allowing reconstitution of a fully functional naïve T-cell pool in the patient thymus. However, it is challenging to produce HTLPs in the high numbers required to meet clinical needs. Here, we found that adding tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF[alpha]) to a DL-4-based culture system led to the generation of a large number of nonmodified or genetically modified HTLPs possessing highly efficient in vitro and in vivo T-cell potential from either CB HSPCs or mPB HSPCs through accelerated T-cell differentiation and enhanced HTLP cell cycling and survival. This study provides a clinically suitable cell culture platform to generate high numbers of clinically potent nonmodified or genetically modified HTLPs for accelerating immune recovery after HSCT and for T-cell-based immunotherapy (including CAR T-cell therapy).","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00706-8"
"cmi","Mucins produced by type II pneumocyte: culprits in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis","The pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sweeping across the world and has caused the loss of more than 3.3 million lives. Before clearance by virus-specific T and B cell-mediated adaptive immunity, excessive inflammation by innate immune cells might cause severe lung and even multiorganic pathologies, thus interfering with antiviral immunity. To curb infection and subsequent organic damage, a deep understanding of the pathogenetic process is highly desirable. Recently, we found that IFN-driven mucin expression in type II alveolar epithelial cells is crucial in initiating hypoxia and early lung pathology1, and SARS-CoV-2 is disposed of by M1 and M2 alveolar macrophages (AMs) in distinct manners2. In this correspondence, we propose that (1) following the invasion of the alveoli and uptake by local alveolar macrophages, SARS-CoV-2 may stimulate macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines, including type I interferon; (2) type I interferon acts on neighboring alveolar type II pneumocytes and activates the cytoplasmic transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR); (3) subsequently, AhR is translocated to the nucleus, where it promotes the expression of mucin genes, leading to mucus production; and (4) mucus begins to accumulate in the alveoli and gradually impairs the exchange of O2 and CO2, initially causing hypoxia and then dampening CO2 exhalation, leading to a critical illness. Here, we dissect these early pathogenic events, which might provide clues to interfering with SARS-CoV-2 infection at an early stage.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00714-8"

The identification of the genetic causes of these diseases therefore has critical clinical implications. We performed whole-exome sequencing of patients with immune dysregulation disorders and identified two patients with previously undescribed mutations in LRRC32, which encodes glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP). These patients were characterized by markedly reduced numbers and frequencies of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Tregs with mutated LRRC32 exhibited strongly diminished cell-surface GARP expression and reduced suppressor function. In a model of conditional Garp deficiency in mice, we confirmed increased susceptibility to inflammatory diseases once GARP expression on Tregs was decreased. Garp deficiency led to an unstable Treg phenotype due to diminished Foxp3 protein acetylation and stability. Our study reinforces the understanding of the immunological mechanisms of immune dysregulation and expands the knowledge on the immunological function of GARP as an important regulator of Treg stability.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00701-z"
"cmi","Aberrant cytokine milieu and signaling affect immune cell phenotypes and functions in tuberculosis pathology: What can we learn from this phenomenon for application to inflammatory syndromes?","Our previous study published in Cellular & Molecular Immunology (Harling et al.1) described aberrant immunological features in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. Overall, we provided evidence supporting an impact chain regarding aberrant high interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 cytokine expression and respective receptor signaling affecting T-cell functions in acute tuberculosis. Constitutive STAT3 phosphorylation, high expression of its key regulator suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)3 and spontaneous IL-6/IL-10 secretion characterized CD4+ T cells from tuberculosis patients. As a consequence, effector cytokine expression of Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis-specific memory T cells was potentially impaired by SOCS3 blocking IL-2-dependent STAT5 phosphorylation. Notably, based on principal component analysis, IL-6, IL-10, pSTAT3, and SOCS3 were the most influential factors that distinguished tuberculosis patients from healthy controls. The study by Harling et al. and others2,3,4,5 performed by our group in the same region in Ghana strengthened the assumption about generally impaired immune mechanisms in acute tuberculosis (depicted in Fig. 1). Phenotypic and functional changes in adaptive and innate immune cells provide a complex picture of tuberculosis pathognomonic mechanisms potentially caused by aberrantly high IL-6 and IL-10 levels. Here, we comment on key findings and the potential relevance for inflammatory syndromes in infectious diseases.Fig. 1IL-6/IL-10-driven immune disorder state in acute tuberculosis and implications for effector and memory T-cell responses.

However, it is largely unknown how cGAS expression is regulated during pathogen infection and autoimmunity. Here, we report that during herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection, two microRNAs (miR-23a and miR-23b) whose levels significantly decrease due to their interaction with the lncRNA Oasl2-209 directly regulate the expression of cGAS. Overexpression of miR-23a/b markedly dampens cytosolic DNA-induced innate immune responses, whereas inhibition of miR-23a/b enhances these responses. Mice treated with miR-23a/b agomirs exhibit increased susceptibility to HSV-1 infection. Moreover, cGAS is significantly upregulated in the Trex1−/− mouse autoimmune disease model. Administration of miR-23a/b blunts self DNA-induced autoinflammatory responses in Trex1−/− mice.

We previously reported that Mn2+ is important in the host defense against cytosolic dsDNA by facilitating cGAS-STING activation and that Mn2+ alone directly activates cGAS independent of dsDNA, leading to an unconventional catalytic synthesis of 2'3'-cGAMP. Herein, we found that Mn2+ strongly promoted immune responses by facilitating antigen uptake, presentation, and germinal center formation via both cGAS-STING and NLRP3 activation. Accordingly, a colloidal manganese salt (Mn jelly, MnJ) was formulated to act not only as an immune potentiator but also as a delivery system to stimulate humoral and cellular immune responses, inducing antibody production and CD4+/CD8+ T-cell proliferation and activation by either intramuscular or intranasal immunization. When administered intranasally, MnJ also worked as a mucosal adjuvant, inducing high levels of secretory IgA. MnJ showed good adjuvant effects for all tested antigens, including T cell-dependent and T cell-independent antigens, such as bacterial capsular polysaccharides, thus indicating that it is a promising adjuvant candidate.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00669-w"
"cmi","The microbiota is dispensable for the early stages of peripheral regulatory T cell induction within mesenteric lymph nodes","Intestinal Foxp3+ regulatory T cell (Treg) subsets are crucial players in tolerance to microbiota-derived and food-borne antigens, and compelling evidence suggests that the intestinal microbiota modulates their generation, functional specialization, and maintenance. Selected bacterial species and microbiota-derived metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), have been reported to promote Treg homeostasis in the intestinal lamina propria. Furthermore, gut-draining mesenteric lymph nodes (mLNs) are particularly efficient sites for the generation of peripherally induced Tregs (pTregs). Despite this knowledge, the direct role of the microbiota and their metabolites in the early stages of pTreg induction within mLNs is not fully elucidated. Here, using an adoptive transfer-based pTreg induction system, we demonstrate that neither transfer of a dysbiotic microbiota nor dietary SCFA supplementation modulated the pTreg induction capacity of mLNs. Even mice housed under germ-free (GF) conditions displayed equivalent pTreg induction within mLNs. Further molecular characterization of these de novo induced pTregs from mLNs by dissection of their transcriptomes and accessible chromatin regions revealed that the microbiota indeed has a limited impact and does not contribute to the initialization of the Treg-specific epigenetic landscape. Overall, our data suggest that the microbiota is dispensable for the early stages of pTreg induction within mLNs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00647-2"
"cmi","Hyaluronan is a natural and effective immunological adjuvant for protein-based vaccines","One of the main goals of vaccine research is the development of adjuvants that can enhance immune responses and are both safe and biocompatible. We explored the application of the natural polymer hyaluronan (HA) as a promising immunological adjuvant for protein-based vaccines. Chemical conjugation of HA to antigens strongly increased their immunogenicity, reduced booster requirements, and allowed antigen dose sparing. HA-based bioconjugates stimulated robust and long-lasting humoral responses without the addition of other immunostimulatory compounds and proved highly efficient when compared to other adjuvants. Due to its intrinsic biocompatibility, HA allowed the exploitation of different injection routes and did not induce inflammation at the inoculation site. This polymer promoted rapid translocation of the antigen to draining lymph nodes, thus facilitating encounters with antigen-presenting cells. Overall, HA can be regarded as an effective and biocompatible adjuvant to be exploited for the design of a wide variety of vaccines.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00667-y"
"cmi","Hydroxychloroquine modulates immunological pathways activated by RNA:DNA hybrids in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome patients carrying RNASEH2 mutations","Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) is a rare genetic disease caused by mutations in nine genes that are all involved in nucleic acid metabolism or sensing.1,2 The three RNASEH2 subunits represent the most frequently mutated genes in AGS patients,1,3 and mutations in RNASEH2 subunits lead to the accumulation of endogenous RNA:DNA hybrids that may trigger an interferon-[alpha]-mediated immune response4 through the activation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs).5 PRRs perform surveillance on extracellular, endosomal, and cytosolic compartments to identify signs of infection: endogenous nucleic acids that are inappropriately cleared may enter and accumulate in the cytoplasm, driving inflammation and autoimmune diseases.6 This accumulation may be the cause of the clinical autoimmune phenotype of AGS patients carrying RNASEH2 mutations. A proven effective cure for AGS has not been discovered, and targeting these two pathways may lead to a treatment that improves patients' immunological symptoms. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) interferes with normal antigen processing and presentation and is widely used in the clinical treatment of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.7 HCQ is also a well-known inhibitor of autophagy that prevents the degradation of autolysosomes. This drug inhibits acidification and maturation of endosomes and increases the pH in lysosomes, resulting in the inhibition of their main functions, such as downstream cell signaling through TLRs.7 Therefore, the aim of our work was to investigate whether HCQ is able to modulate the abnormal inflammatory response driven by RNA:DNA hybrids.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00657-0"
"cmi","Placenta-derived IL-32[beta] activates neutrophils to promote preeclampsia development","Immune activation at the maternal-fetal interface is a main pathogenic factor of preeclampsia (PE). Neutrophils (PMNs) are activated in PE patients, but the mechanism and consequences of PMN activation need to be further explored. Here, we demonstrated that interleukin-32 (IL-32) expression was significantly upregulated in syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs) and that IL-32[beta] was the major isoform with increased expression in the placenta of severe PE (sPE) patients. Furthermore, the level of IL-32 expression in the placenta was correlated with its level in the serum of sPE patients, indicating that IL-32 in the serum is derived mainly from the placenta. Then, in vitro experiments showed that IL-32[beta] could highly activate PMNs and that these IL-32[beta]-activated PMNs were better able to adhere to endothelial cells (HUVECs) and enhance the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in HUVECs, which could be reversed by preincubation with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor VAS 2870. In addition, we showed that IL-32[beta] mainly activated PMNs by binding to proteinase 3. Finally, IL-32[beta] administration induced a PE-like phenotype in a pregnant mouse model. This study provides evidence of the involvement of IL-32[beta] in the pathogenesis of PE.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00636-5"
"cmi","The ubiquitin ligase Peli1 inhibits ICOS and thereby Tfh-mediated immunity","T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are crucial for regulating autoimmune inflammation and protective immunity against viral infection. However, the molecular mechanism controlling Tfh cell differentiation is poorly understood. Here, through two mixed bone marrow chimeric experiments, we identified Peli1, a T cell-enriched E3 ubiquitin ligase, as an intrinsic regulator that inhibits Tfh cell differentiation. Peli1 deficiency significantly promoted c-Rel-mediated inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) expression, and PELI1 mRNA expression was negatively associated with ICOS expression on human CD4+ T cells. Mechanistically, increased ICOS expression on Peli1-KO CD4+ T cells enhanced the activation of PI3K-AKT signaling and thus suppressed the expression of Klf2, a transcription factor that inhibits Tfh differentiation. Therefore, reconstitution of Klf2 abolished the differences in Tfh differentiation and germinal center reaction between WT and Peli1-KO cells. As a consequence, Peli1-deficient CD4+ T cells promoted lupus-like autoimmunity but protected against H1N1 influenza virus infection in mouse models. Collectively, our findings established Peli1 as a critical negative regulator of Tfh differentiation and indicated that targeting Peli1 may have beneficial therapeutic effects in Tfh-related autoimmunity or infectious diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00660-5"
"cmi","Single-cell analysis reveals the origins and intrahepatic development of liver-resident IFN-[gamma]-producing [gamma][delta] T cells","[gamma][delta] T cells are heterogeneous lymphocytes located in various tissues. However, a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the origins of [gamma][delta] T cell heterogeneity and the extrathymic developmental pathway associated with liver [gamma][delta] T cells remain largely unsolved. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to comprehensively catalog the heterogeneity of [gamma][delta] T cells derived from murine liver and thymus samples. We revealed the developmental trajectory of [gamma][delta] T cells and found that the liver contains [gamma][delta] T cell precursors (pre-[gamma][delta] T cells). The developmental potential of hepatic [gamma][delta] T precursor cells was confirmed through in vitro coculture experiments and in vivo adoptive transfer experiments. The adoptive transfer of hematopoietic progenitor Lin−Sca-1+Mac-1+ (LSM) cells from fetal or adult liver samples to sublethally irradiated recipients resulted in the differentiation of liver LSM cells into pre-[gamma][delta] T cells and interferon-gamma+ (IFN-[gamma]+) but not interleukin-17a+ (IL-17a+) [gamma][delta] T cells in the liver. Importantly, thymectomized mouse models showed that IFN-[gamma]-producing [gamma][delta] T cells could originate from liver LSM cells in a thymus-independent manner. These results suggested that liver hematopoietic progenitor LSM cells were able to differentiate into pre-[gamma][delta] T cells and functionally mature [gamma][delta] T cells, which implied that these cells are involved in a distinct developmental pathway independent of thymus-derived [gamma][delta] T cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-021-00656-1"
"cmi","SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 attenuates type I interferon production by inhibiting IRF3 nuclear translocation","SARS-CoV-2 is the pathogenic agent of COVID-19, which has evolved into a global pandemic. Compared with some other respiratory RNA viruses, SARS-CoV-2 is a poor inducer of type I interferon (IFN). Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 nsp12, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), suppresses host antiviral responses. SARS-CoV-2 nsp12 attenuated Sendai virus (SeV)- or poly(I:C)-induced IFN-[beta] promoter activation in a dose-dependent manner. It also inhibited IFN promoter activation triggered by RIG-I, MDA5, MAVS, and IRF3 overexpression. Nsp12 did not impair IRF3 phosphorylation but suppressed the nuclear translocation of IRF3. Mutational analyses suggested that this suppression was not dependent on the polymerase activity of nsp12. Given these findings, our study reveals that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp can antagonize host antiviral innate immunity and thus provides insights into viral pathogenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00619-y"

This characteristic has devastating consequences for patients with immune-mediated diseases, including many neurological conditions. However, nature often creates a system of “checks and balances”, and the immune system is no exception, having developed a repair strategy to mitigate unwanted tissue damage resulting from leukocyte responses to microbes.

CD4+ T cells have been reported to play vital roles in GO progression. To explore the pathogenic CD4+ T cell types that drive GO progression, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), T cell receptor sequencing (TCR-Seq), flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assays to evaluate CD4+ T cells from GO and GH patients. scRNA-Seq revealed the novel GO-specific cell type CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), which are characterized by chemotactic and inflammatory features. The clonal expansion of this CD4+ CTL population, as demonstrated by TCR-Seq, along with their strong cytotoxic response to autoantigens, localization in orbital sites, and potential relationship with disease relapse provide strong evidence for the pathogenic roles of GZMB and IFN-[gamma]-secreting CD4+ CTLs in GO. Therefore, cytotoxic pathways may become potential therapeutic targets for GO.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00615-2"
"cmi","Systematic evaluation of IgG responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-derived peptides for monitoring COVID-19 patients","Serological tests play an essential role in monitoring and combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Recombinant spike protein (S protein), especially the S1 protein, is one of the major reagents used for serological tests. However, the high cost of S protein production and possible cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses pose unavoidable challenges. By taking advantage of a peptide microarray with full spike protein coverage, we analyzed 2,434 sera from 858 COVID-19 patients, 63 asymptomatic patients and 610 controls collected from multiple clinical centers. Based on the results, we identified several S protein-derived 12-mer peptides that have high diagnostic performance. In particular, for monitoring the IgG response, one peptide (aa 1148-1159 or S2-78) exhibited a sensitivity (95.5%, 95% CI 93.7-96.9%) and specificity (96.7%, 95% CI 94.8-98.0%) comparable to those of the S1 protein for the detection of both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, the diagnostic performance of the S2-78 (aa 1148-1159) IgG was successfully validated by ELISA in an independent sample cohort. A panel of four peptides, S1-93 (aa 553-564), S1-97 (aa 577-588), S1-101 (aa 601-612) and S1-105 (aa 625-636), that likely will avoid potential cross-reactivity with sera from patients infected by other coronaviruses was constructed.

Very recently, we genetically linked a short-peptide fusion inhibitor with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) attachment signal, rendering modified cells fully resistant to HIV infection. In this study, GPI-anchored m36.4, a single-domain antibody (nanobody) targeting the coreceptor-binding site of gp120, was constructed with a lentiviral vector. We verified that m36.4 was efficiently expressed on the plasma membrane of transduced TZM-bl cells and targeted lipid raft sites without affecting the expression of HIV receptors (CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4). Significantly, TZM-bl cells expressing GPI-m36.4 were highly resistant to infection with divergent HIV-1 subtypes and potently blocked HIV-1 envelope-mediated cell-cell fusion and cell-cell viral transmission. Furthermore, we showed that GPI-m36.4-modified human CEMss-CCR5 cells were nonpermissive to both CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolates and displayed a strong survival advantage over unmodified cells. It was found that GPI-m36.4 could also impair HIV-1 Env processing and viral infectivity in transduced cells, underlying a multifaceted mechanism of antiviral action. In conclusion, our studies characterize m36.4 as a powerful nanobody that can generate HIV-resistant cells, offering a novel gene therapy approach that can be used alone or in combination.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00627-y"

"cmi","The roles of microglia in viral encephalitis: from sensome to therapeutic targeting","Viral encephalitis is a devastating disease with high mortality, and survivors often suffer from severe neurological complications. Microglia are innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma whose turnover is reliant on local proliferation. Microglia express a diverse range of proteins, which allows them to continuously sense the environment and quickly react to changes. Under inflammatory conditions such as CNS viral infection, microglia promote innate and adaptive immune responses to protect the host. However, during viral infection, a dysregulated microglia-T-cell interplay may result in altered phagocytosis of neuronal synapses by microglia that causes neurocognitive impairment. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role of microglia in viral encephalitis, propose questions to be answered in the future and suggest possible therapeutic targets.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00620-5"

However, the mechanism underlying this failure is poorly understood. We aimed to investigate the influence of bile acids (BAs), especially taurocholic acid (TCA), on the response to PegIFN[alpha] therapy in CHB patients. Here, we used mass spectrometry to determine serum BA profiles in 110 patients with chronic HBV infection and 20 healthy controls (HCs). We found that serum BAs, especially TCA, were significantly elevated in HBeAg-positive CHB patients compared with those in HCs and patients in other phases of chronic HBV infection. Moreover, serum BAs, particularly TCA, inhibited the response to PegIFN[alpha] therapy in HBeAg-positive CHB patients. Mechanistically, the expression levels of IFN-[gamma], TNF-[alpha], granzyme B, and perforin were measured using flow cytometry to assess the effector functions of immune cells in patients with low or high BA levels. We found that BAs reduced the number and proportion and impaired the effector functions of CD3+CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells in HBeAg-positive CHB patients. TCA in particular reduced the frequency and impaired the effector functions of CD3+CD8+ T and NK cells in vitro and in vivo and inhibited the immunoregulatory activity of IFN-[alpha] in vitro. Thus, our results show that BAs, especially TCA, inhibit the response to PegIFN[alpha] therapy by impairing the effector functions of CD3+CD8+ T and NK cells in HBeAg-positive CHB patients. Our findings suggest that targeting TCA could be a promising approach for restoring IFN-[alpha] responsiveness during CHB treatment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00601-8"

TLR7 is a pattern recognition receptor that senses single-stranded RNAs from viruses and host tissue cells; however, its role in type 1 diabetes development remains unclear. In our study, we discovered that Tlr7-deficient (Tlr7−/−) nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, a model of human type 1 diabetes, exhibited a significantly delayed onset and reduced incidence of type 1 diabetes compared with Tlr7-sufficient (Tlr7+/+) NOD mice. Mechanistic investigations showed that Tlr7 deficiency significantly altered B-cell differentiation and immunoglobulin production. Moreover, Tlr7−/− NOD B cells were found to suppress diabetogenic CD4+ T-cell responses and protect immunodeficient NOD mice from developing diabetes induced by diabetogenic T cells. In addition, we found that Tlr7 deficiency suppressed the antigen-presenting functions of B cells and inhibited cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell activation by downregulating the expression of both nonclassical and classical MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules on B cells. Our data suggest that TLR7 contributes to type 1 diabetes development by regulating B-cell functions and subsequent interactions with T cells. Therefore, therapeutically targeting TLR7 may prove beneficial for disease protection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00590-8"

The highly divergent and variable clinical outcomes, as well as the fluctuating involvement of different organ systems, link SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis to the immune response of an individual host. Thus, detailed knowledge of the cellular and humoral mechanisms underlying antiviral immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is pivotal for understanding the concept of host susceptibility, evaluating therapeutic regimens and designing vaccination strategies.

"cmi","Potentiation of NETs release is novel characteristic of TREM-1 activation and the pharmacological inhibition of TREM-1 could prevent from the deleterious consequences of NETs release in sepsis","During sepsis, neutrophil activation induces endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction partly through neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) release. The triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cell-1 (TREM-1) is an orphan immune receptor that amplifies the inflammatory response mediated by Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) engagement. Although the key role of TLR4 signaling in NETosis is known, the role of TREM-1 in this process has not yet been investigated. Here, we report that TREM-1 potentiates NET release by human and murine neutrophils and is a component of the NET structure. In contrast, pharmacologic inhibition or genetic ablation of TREM-1 decreased NETosis in vitro and during experimental septic shock in vivo. Moreover, isolated NETs were able to activate ECs and impair vascular reactivity, and these deleterious effects were dampened by TREM-1 inhibition. TREM-1 may, therefore, constitute a new therapeutic target to prevent NETosis and associated endothelial dysfunction.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00591-7"

Both human and murine Treg cells are characterized by high expression of the cytokine IL-2 receptor [alpha] chain (CD25) and expression of the transcription factor Foxp3, which is necessary for the development, function and stability of these cells. The main function of Treg cells is the regulation or suppression other immune cell functions, such as the activation, proliferation, and cytokine production of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells. In this way, Treg cells control the immune response to antigens, including toxins, chemicals, bacteria, viruses, or other substances, that come from outside the body as well as the immune response to self-antigens, thereby helping to prevent autoimmune disease. However, little is known about the effects of glucocorticoids on these cells. This lack of understanding is initially surprising because Treg cells were identified many years ago, and research in the field of glucocorticoids is very intensive due to the immense clinical importance of these therapeutics. Given this background, the new insights gained represent an important enrichment of our knowledge about both Treg cells and the mechanisms of glucocorticoid action and may help to identify new ways to optimize the benefit-risk ratio of these important drugs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00598-0"

However, it is not completely understood to what degree IL-2R signaling is required for Treg cell homeostasis, lineage stability and function in both resting and inflammatory conditions. Here, we characterized a spontaneous mutant mouse strain endowed with a hypomorphic Tyr129His variant of CD25, the [alpha]-chain of IL-2R, which resulted in diminished receptor expression and reduced IL-2R signaling. Under noninflammatory conditions, Cd25Y129H mice harbored substantially lower numbers of peripheral Treg cells with stable Foxp3 expression that prevented the development of spontaneous autoimmune disease. In contrast, Cd25Y129H Treg cells failed to efficiently induce immune suppression and lost lineage commitment in a T-cell transfer colitis model, indicating that unimpaired IL-2R signaling is critical for Treg cell function in inflammatory environments. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing of Treg cells revealed that impaired IL-2R signaling profoundly affected the balance of central and effector Treg cell subsets. Thus, partial loss of IL-2R signaling differentially interferes with the maintenance, heterogeneity, and suppressive function of the Treg cell pool.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00599-z"

In this study, using either live SARS-CoV-2 particles or retroviruses pseudotyped with the SARS-CoV-2 S viral surface protein (Spike), we studied the neutralizing antibody (nAb) response in serum samples from a cohort of 140 SARS-CoV-2 qPCR-confirmed infections, including patients with mild symptoms and also more severe forms, including those that required intensive care. We show that nAb titers correlated strongly with disease severity and with anti-spike IgG levels. Indeed, patients from intensive care units exhibited high nAb titers; conversely, patients with milder disease symptoms had heterogeneous nAb titers, and asymptomatic or exclusive outpatient-care patients had no or low nAbs. We found that nAb activity in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients displayed a relatively rapid decline after recovery compared to individuals infected with other coronaviruses. Moreover, we found an absence of cross-neutralization between endemic coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, indicating that previous infection by human coronaviruses may not generate protective nAbs against SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we found that the D614G mutation in the spike protein, which has recently been identified as the current major variant in Europe, does not allow neutralization escape. Altogether, our results contribute to our understanding of the immune correlates of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, and rapid evaluation of the role of the humoral response in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is warranted.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00588-2"

Our previous studies showed that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) exhibited impaired immunosuppressive function during disease progression in patients with SS and mice with experimental Sjögren's syndrome (ESS), but it remains unclear whether restoring the function of MDSCs can effectively ameliorate the development of ESS. In this study, we found that murine olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (OE-MSC-Exos) significantly enhanced the suppressive function of MDSCs by upregulating arginase expression and increasing ROS and NO levels. Moreover, treatment with OE-MSC-Exos via intravenous injection markedly attenuated disease progression and restored MDSC function in ESS mice. Mechanistically, OE-MSC-Exo-secreted IL-6 activated the Jak2/Stat3 pathway in MDSCs. In addition, the abundant S100A4 in OE-MSC-Exos acted as a key factor in mediating the endogenous production of IL-6 by MDSCs via TLR4 signaling, indicating an autocrine pathway of MDSC functional modulation by IL-6. Taken together, our results demonstrated that OE-MSC-Exos possess therapeutic potential to attenuate ESS progression by enhancing the immunosuppressive function of MDSCs, possibly constituting a new strategy for the treatment of Sjögren's syndrome and other autoimmune diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00587-3"

"cmi","A machine learning approach to predict response to immunotherapy in type 1 diabetes","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease mediated by self-reactive T cells that destroy insulin-producing [beta] cells of the pancreatic islets.1 The disease is a complex multifactorial disorder resulting from a poorly defined interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Approximately 40-50% of the disease risk is linked to genes, with the remaining risk arising from environmental factors. HLA genes account for approximately one-half of T1D risk, and the residual risk may be ascribed to more than 40 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes outside the HLA region. Among confirmed non-HLA susceptibility genes, the best-characterized polymorphisms are related to INS, PTPN22, IL2RA, IFIH1, and CTLA4.2 Islet-specific autoantibodies are a hallmark of T1D and currently the best predictive biomarker of disease progression.3 However, the mechanism leading to the loss of humoral tolerance in T1D is not fully understood, with the exception of a few studies showing diminished B cell central tolerance in patients with T1D.4 B cells acquire their antibody-secreting function after interaction with a specific subset of CD4 T cells in specialized structures within the B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid organs, known as germinal centers. The CD4 T-cell subset that provides the help necessary for B cells to differentiate into memory B cells and high-affinity antibody-producing plasma cells is known as follicular helper T (TFH) cells.5","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00594-4"
"cmi","Immunological mechanisms and therapeutic targets of fatty liver diseases","Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are the two major types of chronic liver disease worldwide. Inflammatory processes play key roles in the pathogeneses of fatty liver diseases, and continuous inflammation promotes the progression of alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Although both ALD and NAFLD are closely related to inflammation, their respective developmental mechanisms differ to some extent. Here, we review the roles of multiple immunological mechanisms and therapeutic targets related to the inflammation associated with fatty liver diseases and the differences in the progression of ASH and NASH. Multiple cell types in the liver, including macrophages, neutrophils, other immune cell types and hepatocytes, are involved in fatty liver disease inflammation. In addition, microRNAs (miRNAs), extracellular vesicles (EVs), and complement also contribute to the inflammatory process, as does intertissue crosstalk between the liver and the intestine, adipose tissue, and the nervous system. We point out that inflammation also plays important roles in promoting liver repair and controlling bacterial infections. Understanding the complex regulatory process of disrupted homeostasis during the development of fatty liver diseases may lead to the development of improved targeted therapeutic intervention strategies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00579-3"

Despite global efforts to control this viral infection, the pandemic is still surging. While facing such a serious, unprecedented situation, vaccines are likely the most promising method to control this newly identified coronavirus. A recent study from Yang et al.2 showed that a recombinant spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS-CoV-2 prepared from insect cells induced protective immunity in nonhuman primates, providing a feasible vaccine candidate for COVID-19 control (Fig. 1).Fig. 1A recombinant vaccine targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike can induce a protective immune response. The recombinant RBD protein was expressed in insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac system and Alum-precipitated for vaccine formulation.

Using the same technology, we report here the identification, by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), of three NK cell subpopulations in human bone marrow. Pseudotime analysis identified a subset of resident CD56bright NK cells, NK0 cells, as the precursor of both circulating CD56dim NK1-like NK cells and CD56bright NK2-like NK cells in human bone marrow and spleen under physiological conditions. Transcriptomic profiles of bone marrow NK cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibited stress-induced repression of NK cell effector functions, highlighting the profound impact of this disease on NK cell heterogeneity.

"cmi","Targeting the CD146/Galectin-9 axis protects the integrity of the blood-brain barrier in experimental cerebral malaria","Cerebral malaria (CM) is a life-threatening diffuse encephalopathy caused by Plasmodium falciparum, in which the destruction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the main cause of death. However, increasing evidence has shown that antimalarial drugs, the current treatment for CM, do little to protect against CM-induced BBB damage. Therefore, a means to alleviate BBB dysfunction would be a promising adjuvant therapy for CM. The adhesion molecule CD146 has been reported to be expressed in both endothelial cells and proinflammatory immune cells and mediates neuroinflammation. Here, we demonstrate that CD146 expressed on BBB endothelial cells but not immune cells is a novel therapeutic target in a mouse model of experimental cerebral malaria (eCM). Endothelial CD146 is upregulated during eCM development and facilitates the sequestration of infected red blood cells (RBCs) and/or proinflammatory lymphocytes in CNS blood vessels, thereby promoting the disruption of BBB integrity. Mechanistic studies showed that the interaction of CD146 and Galectin-9 contributes to the aggregation of infected RBCs and lymphocytes. Deletion of endothelial CD146 or treatment with the anti-CD146 antibody AA98 prevents severe signs of eCM, such as limb paralysis, brain vascular leakage, and death. In addition, AA98 combined with the antiparasitic drug artemether improved the cognition and memory of mice with eCM. Taken together, our findings suggest that endothelial CD146 is a novel and promising target in combination with antiparasitic drugs for future CM therapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00582-8"
"cmi","Uncovering the multifaceted roles played by neutrophils in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) is a life-saving procedure used for the treatment of selected hematological malignancies, inborn errors of metabolism, and bone marrow failures. The role of neutrophils in alloHSCT has been traditionally evaluated only in the context of their ability to act as a first line of defense against infection. However, recent evidence has highlighted neutrophils as key effectors of innate and adaptive immune responses through a wide array of newly discovered functions. Accordingly, neutrophils are emerging as highly versatile cells that are able to acquire different, often opposite, functional capacities depending on the microenvironment and their differentiation status. Herein, we review the current knowledge on the multiple functions that neutrophils exhibit through the different stages of alloHSCT, from the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization in the donor to the immunological reconstitution that occurs in the recipient following HSC infusion. We also discuss the influence exerted on neutrophils by the immunosuppressive drugs delivered in the course of alloHSCT as part of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Finally, the potential involvement of neutrophils in alloHSCT-related complications, such as transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA), acute and chronic GVHD, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation, is also discussed. Based on the data reviewed herein, the role played by neutrophils in alloHSCT is far greater than a simple antimicrobial role. However, much remains to be investigated in terms of the potential functions that neutrophils might exert during a highly complex procedure such as alloHSCT.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00581-9"
"cmi","The SUMOylation of TAB2 mediated by TRIM60 inhibits MAPK/NF-[kappa]B activation and the innate immune response","Activation of the TAK1 signalosome is crucial for mediating the innate immune response to pathogen invasion and is regulated by multiple layers of posttranslational modifications, including ubiquitination, SUMOylation, and phosphorylation; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, TRIM60 negatively regulated the formation and activation of the TAK1 signalosome. Deficiency of TRIM60 in macrophages led to enhanced MAPK and NF-[kappa]B activation, accompanied by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines but not IFN-I. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry assays identified TAB2 as the target of TRIM60 for SUMOylation rather than ubiquitination, resulting in impaired formation of the TRAF6/TAB2/TAK1 complex and downstream MAPK and NF-[kappa]B pathways. The SUMOylation sites of TAB2 mediated by TRIM60 were identified as K329 and K562; substitution of these lysines with arginines abolished the SUMOylation of TAB2. In vivo experiments showed that TRIM60-deficient mice showed an elevated immune response to LPS-induced septic shock and L. monocytogenes infection. Our data reveal that SUMOylation of TAB2 mediated by TRIM60 is a novel mechanism for regulating the innate immune response, potentially paving the way for a new strategy to control antibacterial immune responses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00564-w"
"cmi","Themis regulates metabolic signaling and effector functions in CD4+ T cells by controlling NFAT nuclear translocation","Themis is a T cell lineage-specific molecule that is involved in TCR signal transduction. The effects of germline Themis deletion on peripheral CD4+ T cell function have not been described before. In this study, we found that Themis-deficient CD4+ T cells had poor proliferative responses, reduced cytokine production in vitro and weaker inflammatory potential, as measured by their ability to cause colitis in vivo. Resting T cells are quiescent, whereas activated T cells have high metabolic demands. Fulfillment of these metabolic demands depends upon nutrient availability and upregulation of nutrient intake channels after efficient TCR signal transduction, which leads to metabolic reprogramming in T cells. We tested whether defects in effector functions were caused by impaired metabolic shifts in Themis-deficient CD4+ T cells due to inefficient TCR signal transduction, in turn caused by the lack of Themis. We found that upon TCR stimulation, Themis-deficient CD4+ T cells were unable to upregulate the expression of insulin receptor (IR), glucose transporter (GLUT1), the neutral amino acid transporter CD98 and the mTOR pathway, as measured by c-Myc and pS6 expression. Mitochondrial analysis of activated Themis-deficient CD4+ T cells showed more oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) than aerobic glycolysis, indicating defective metabolic reprogramming. Furthermore, we found reduced NFAT translocation in Themis-deficient CD4+ T cells upon TCR stimulation. Using previously reported ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data, we found that NFAT nuclear translocation controls IR gene expression. Together, our results describe an internal circuit between TCR signal transduction, NFAT nuclear translocation, and metabolic signaling in CD4+ T cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00578-4"

Currently, neutrophils, with their autocrine, paracrine, and immune modulation functions, have been shown to be involved in liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer.

"cmi","Priming with FLO8-deficient Candida albicans induces Th1-biased protective immunity against lethal polymicrobial sepsis","The morphological switch between yeast and hyphae of Candida albicans is essential for its interaction with the host defense system. However, the lack of understanding of host-pathogen interactions during C. albicans infection greatly hampers the development of effective immunotherapies. Here, we found that priming with the C. albicans FLO8-deficient (flo8) mutant, locked in yeast form, protected mice from subsequent lethal C. albicans infection. Deficiency of Dectin-2, a fungus-derived [alpha]-mannan recognition receptor, completely blocked flo8 mutant-induced protection. Mechanistically, the flo8 mutant-induced Dectin-2/CARD9-mediated IL-10 production in DCs and macrophages to block thymus atrophy by inhibiting the C. albicans-induced apoptosis of thymic T cells, which facilitated the continuous output of naive T cells from the thymus to the spleen. Continuous recruitment of naive T cells to the spleen enhanced Th1-biased antifungal immune responses. Consequently, depletion of CD4+ T cells or blockade of IL-10 receptor function using specific antibodies in mice completely blocked the protective effects of flo8 mutant priming against C. albicans infection. Moreover, mannans exposed on the surface of the flo8 mutant were responsible for eliciting protective immunity by inhibiting the C. albicans-induced apoptosis of thymic T cells to sustain the number of naive T cells in the spleen. Importantly, priming with the flo8 mutant extensively protected mice from polymicrobial infection caused by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) by enhancing Th1-biased immune responses. Together, our findings imply that targeting FLO8 in C. albicans elicits protective immune responses against polymicrobial infections and that mannans extracted from the flo8 mutant are potential immunotherapeutic candidate(s) for controlling infectious diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00576-6"

"cmi","Opposing regulatory functions of the TIM3 (HAVCR2) signalosome in primary effector T cells as revealed by quantitative interactomics","Deciphering how T-cell antigen receptor signals are modulated by coinhibitors is a fundamental goal in immunology and of considerable clinical interest because blocking coinhibitory signals via therapeutic antibodies have become a standard cancer immunotherapeutic strategy. Most of the attention devoted to T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM3; also known as HAVCR2 or CD366) molecules stems from their expression on exhausted T cells in settings of chronic viral infection and tumors. Moreover, T cells expressing high levels of both PD-1 and TIM3 coinhibitors appear more dysfunctional than those expressing PD-1 alone. Combination therapies intending to block both PD-1 and TIM3 are thus actively being explored in the cancer treatment setting. Upon interaction with Galectin-9 (GAL-9) and carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM-1), the tyrosines found in the TIM3 cytoplasmic tail are phosphorylated.1 Because these conserved tyrosines do not form a recognizable inhibitory signaling motif, the mechanism by which TIM3 transmits inhibitory signals has not been elucidated. Paradoxically, TIM3 also has costimulatory activity in T cells.2,3 Published biochemical studies attempting to unveil the mode of action of TIM3 have relied on approaches addressing one candidate effector at a time with limited quantitative insight, and most used transformed cells. Using mice expressing an affinity Twin-Strep-tag (OST) at the TIM3-protein C-terminus (TIM3OST mice) (Figs. 1a and S1a) and affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (AP-MS), we herein defined the composition and dynamics of the signaling protein complex (signalosome) used by TIM3 in primary effector T cells.

We used a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) and SARS-CoV-2 S protein-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vector-based neutralization assay (pVNT) to assess the degree to which serum antibodies from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent patients interfere with the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S to ACE2. Both tests revealed neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies in the sera of ~90% of mildly and 100% of severely affected COVID-19 convalescent patients. Importantly, sVNT and pVNT results correlated strongly with each other and to the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 S1 IgG and IgA antibodies. Moreover, levels of neutralizing antibodies correlated with the duration and severity of clinical symptoms but not with patient age. Compared to pVNT, sVNT is less sophisticated and does not require any biosafety labs. Since this assay is also much faster and cheaper, sVNT will not only be important for evaluating the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies in a population but also for identifying promising plasma donors for successful passive antibody therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00573-9"

Here, we identified SARS-CoV-2 membrane glycoprotein M as a negative regulator of the innate immune response.

"cmi","Antigen presentation, autoantibody production, and therapeutic targets in autoimmune liver disease","The liver is an important immunological organ that controls systemic tolerance. The liver harbors professional and unconventional antigen-presenting cells that are crucial for tolerance induction and maintenance. Orchestrating the immune response in homeostasis depends on a healthy and well-toned immunological liver microenvironment, which is maintained by the crosstalk of liver-resident antigen-presenting cells and intrahepatic and liver-infiltrating leukocytes. In response to pathogens or autoantigens, tolerance is disrupted by unknown mechanisms. Intrahepatic parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells exhibit unique antigen-presenting properties. The presentation of microbial and endogenous lipid-, metabolite- and peptide-derived antigens from the gut via conventional and nonconventional mechanisms can educate intrahepatic immune cells and elicit effector responses or tolerance. Perturbation of this balance results in autoimmune liver diseases, such as autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Although the exact etiologies of these autoimmune liver diseases are unknown, it is thought that the disruption of tolerance towards self-antigens and microbial metabolites and lipids, as well as alterations in bile acid composition, may result in changes in effector cell activation and polarization and may reduce or impair protective anti-inflammatory regulatory T and B cell responses. Additionally, the canonical and noncanonical transmission of antigens and antigen:MHC complexes via trogocytosis or extracellular vesicles between different (non) immune cells in the liver may play a role in the induction of hepatic inflammation and tolerance. Here, we summarize emerging aspects of antigen presentation, autoantibody production, and the application of novel therapeutic approaches in the characterization and treatment of autoimmune liver diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00568-6"
"cmi","Implications of metabolism-driven myeloid dysfunctions in cancer therapy","Immune homeostasis is maintained by an adequate balance of myeloid and lymphoid responses. In chronic inflammatory states, including cancer, this balance is lost due to dramatic expansion of myeloid progenitors that fail to mature to functional inflammatory neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), thus giving rise to a decline in the antitumor effector lymphoid response. Cancer-related inflammation orchestrates the production of hematopoietic growth factors and cytokines that perpetuate recruitment and activation of myeloid precursors, resulting in unresolved and chronic inflammation. This pathologic inflammation creates profound alterations in the intrinsic cellular metabolism of the myeloid progenitor pool, which is amplified by competition for essential nutrients and by hypoxia-induced metabolic rewiring at the tumor site. Therefore, persistent myelopoiesis and metabolic dysfunctions contribute to the development of cancer, as well as to the severity of a broad range of diseases, including metabolic syndrome and autoimmune and infectious diseases. The aims of this review are to (1) define the metabolic networks implicated in aberrant myelopoiesis observed in cancer patients, (2) discuss the mechanisms underlying these clinical manifestations and the impact of metabolic perturbations on clinical outcomes, and (3) explore new biomarkers and therapeutic strategies to restore immunometabolism and differentiation of myeloid cells towards an effector phenotype to increase host antitumor immunity. We propose that the profound metabolic alterations and associated transcriptional changes triggered by chronic and overactivated immune responses in myeloid cells represent critical factors influencing the balance between therapeutic efficacy and immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) for current therapeutic strategies, including immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00556-w"
"cmi","Low-dose IL-2 therapy compensates for metabolic shifts and reverses anxiety-like behavior in PD-1 deficiency-induced autoimmunity","In patients with autoimmune diseases, psychological comorbidities, including anxiety, depression and cognitive dysfunction, often occur.1 Anxiety and depression in these patients not only cause a significant disease burden1 but also might prevent effective treatment through the neuro-immune axis.2 The latter issue results in disease aggravation and, in turn, adversely impacts psychological and social wellbeing. Therefore, effective treatment is required to break the vicious feedforward cycle of physical-psychological interactions. Although patient anxiety and depression are driven by prolonged pain and fatigue, recent studies have suggested a new mechanism whereby the dysregulated immune system can directly modulate the nervous system to induce emotional and behavioral changes. In PD-1-deficient (Pdcd1−/−) mice, a model for excessive immune activation, aberrant activation of T cells induces metabolic shifts by depleting amino acids, including tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr), which are essential precursors for monoamine neurotransmitter synthesis in the brain. Impaired brain function then results in anxiety-like behavior and exacerbates fear responses.3 In another study, CD4+ T cell-derived xanthine was shown to act on oligodendrocytes and underpin stress-induced anxiety-like behavior.4 These new discoveries suggest that anxiety and depression in autoimmune diseases can be caused, at least partially, by altered immune systems, such as excessive T-cell activation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00562-y"
"cmi","Unique immunological profile in patients with COVID-19","The relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and host immunity is poorly understood. We performed an extensive analysis of immune responses in 32 patients with severe COVID-19, some of whom succumbed. A control population of healthy subjects was included. Patients with COVID-19 had an altered distribution of peripheral blood lymphocytes, with an increased proportion of mature natural killer (NK) cells and low T-cell numbers. NK cells and CD8+ T cells overexpressed T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-3 (TIM-3) and CD69. NK cell exhaustion was attested by increased frequencies of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) positive cells and reduced frequencies of natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D)-, DNAX accessory molecule-1 (DNAM-1)- and sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectin 7 (Siglec-7)-expressing NK cells, associated with a reduced ability to secrete interferon (IFN)[gamma]. Patients with poor outcome showed a contraction of immature CD56bright and an expansion of mature CD57+ Fc[epsilon]RI[gamma]neg adaptive NK cells compared to survivors. Increased serum levels of IL-6 were also more frequently identified in deceased patients compared to survivors. Of note, monocytes secreted abundant quantities of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1[beta] which persisted at lower levels several weeks after recovery with concomitant normalization of CD69, PD-1 and TIM-3 expression and restoration of CD8+ T cell numbers. A hyperactivated/exhausted immune response dominate in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, probably driven by an uncontrolled secretion of inflammatory cytokines by monocytes. These findings unveil a unique immunological profile in COVID-19 patients that will help to design effective stage-specific treatments for this potentially deadly disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00557-9"

Although there is growing evidence that BLT1 plays crucial roles in immune responses, its role in dendritic cells remains largely unknown. Here, we identified novel DC subsets defined by the expression of BLT1, namely, BLT1hi and BLT1lo DCs. We also found that BLT1hi and BLT1lo DCs differentially migrated toward LTB4 and CCL21, a lymph node-homing chemoattractant, respectively. By generating LTB4-producing enzyme LTA4H knockout mice and CD11c promoter-driven Cre recombinase-expressing BLT1 conditional knockout (BLT1 cKO) mice, we showed that the migration of BLT1hi DCs exacerbated allergic contact dermatitis. Comprehensive transcriptome analysis revealed that BLT1hi DCs preferentially induced Th1 differentiation by upregulating IL-12p35 expression, whereas BLT1lo DCs accelerated T cell proliferation by producing IL-2. Collectively, the data reveal an unexpected role for BLT1 as a novel DC subset marker and provide novel insights into the role of the LTB4-BLT1 axis in the spatiotemporal regulation of distinct DC subsets.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00559-7"
"cmi","A compromised specific humoral immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain is related to viral persistence and periodic shedding in the gastrointestinal tract","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been redetected after discharge in some coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. The reason for the recurrent positivity of the test and the potential public health concern due to this occurrence are still unknown. Here, we analyzed the viral data and clinical manifestations of 289 domestic Chinese COVID-19 patients and found that 21 individuals (7.3%) were readmitted for hospitalization after detection of SARS-CoV-2 after discharge. First, we experimentally confirmed that the virus was involved in the initial infection and was not a secondary infection. In positive retests, the virus was usually found in anal samples (15 of 21, 71.4%). Through analysis of the intracellular viral subgenomic messenger RNA (sgmRNA), we verified that positive retest patients had active viral replication in their gastrointestinal tracts (3 of 16 patients, 18.7%) but not in their respiratory tracts. Then, we found that viral persistence was not associated with high viral titers, delayed viral clearance, old age, or more severe clinical symptoms during the first hospitalization. In contrast, viral rebound was associated with significantly lower levels of and slower generation of viral receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific IgA and IgG antibodies. Our study demonstrated that the positive retest patients failed to create a robust protective humoral immune response, which might result in SARS-CoV-2 persistence in the gastrointestinal tract and possibly in active viral shedding. Further exploration of the mechanism underlying the rebound in SARS-CoV-2 in this population will be crucial for preventing virus spread and developing effective vaccines.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00550-2"

Activation and expansion of V[gamma]9V[delta]2 T cells is also achieved by aminobisphosphonates (n-BPs), which promote the intracellular accumulation of PAgs. Because of their potent cytotoxic and antitumor activity, V[gamma]9V[delta]2 T cells are particularly indicated for use in cancer immunotherapy, even against tumors with low mutational burdens.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00553-z"
"cmi","Transcription tipping points for T follicular helper cell and T-helper 1 cell fate commitment","During viral infection, immune cells coordinate the induction of inflammatory responses that clear infection and humoral responses that promote protection. CD4+ T-cell differentiation sits at the center of this axis. Differentiation toward T-helper 1 (Th1) cells mediates inflammation and pathogen clearance, while T follicular helper (Tfh) cells facilitate germinal center (GC) reactions for the generation of high-affinity antibodies and immune memory. While Th1 and Tfh differentiation occurs in parallel, these CD4+ T-cell identities are mutually exclusive, and progression toward these ends is determined via the upregulation of T-bet and Bcl6, respectively. These lineage-defining transcription factors act in concert with multiple networks of transcriptional regulators that tip the T-bet and Bcl6 axis in CD4+ T-cell progenitors to either a Th1 or Tfh fate. It is now clear that these transcriptional networks are guided by cytokine cues that are not only varied between distinct viral infections but also dynamically altered throughout the duration of infection. Thus, multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors combine to specify the fate, plasticity, and function of Th1 and Tfh cells during infection. Here, we review the current information on the mode of action of the lineage-defining transcription factors Bcl6 and T-bet and how they act individually and in complex to govern CD4+ T-cell ontogeny. Furthermore, we outline the multifaceted transcriptional regulatory networks that act upstream and downstream of Bcl6 and T-bet to tip the differentiation equilibrium toward either a Tfh or Th1 fate and how these are impacted by dynamic inflammatory cues.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00554-y"
"cmi","STING regulates BCR signaling in normal and malignant B cells","STING is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein critical for sensing cytoplasmic DNA and promoting the production of type I interferons; however, the role of STING in B cell receptor (BCR) signaling remains unclear. We generated STING V154M knock-in mice and showed that B cells carrying constitutively activated STING specifically degraded membrane-bound IgM, Ig[alpha], and Ig[beta] via SEL1L/HRD1-mediated ER-associated degradation (ERAD). B cells with activated STING were thus less capable of responding to BCR activation by phosphorylating Ig[alpha] and Syk than those without activated STING. When immunized with T-independent antigens, STING V154M mice produced significantly fewer antigen-specific plasma cells and antibodies than immunized wild-type (WT) mice. We further generated B cell-specific STINGKO mice and showed that STINGKO B cells indeed responded to activation by transducing stronger BCR signals than their STING-proficient counterparts. When B cell-specific STINGKO mice were T-independently immunized, they produced significantly more antigen-specific plasma cells and antibodies than immunized STINGWT mice. Since both human and mouse IGHV-unmutated malignant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells downregulated the expression of STING, we explored whether STING downregulation could contribute to the well-established robust BCR signaling phenotype in malignant CLL cells. We generated a STING-deficient CLL mouse model and showed that STING-deficient CLL cells were indeed more responsive to BCR activation than their STING-proficient counterparts. These results revealed a novel B cell-intrinsic role of STING in negatively regulating BCR signaling in both normal and malignant B cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00552-0"

To date, over 23 million people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide, and this disease has caused more than 800,000 deaths. Hyperinflammation elicited by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been reported to contribute to illness severity and death.1,2 Humoral immune responses play important roles in therapy and prophylaxis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Since the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to trigger virion endocytosis, antibodies against this domain may be able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and possibly provide protective immunity in COVID-19 patients.3 Clinical trials investigating the administration of convalescent plasma and the interleukin (IL)-6 antagonist tocilizumab to treat COVID-19 patients are currently underway,4 but the overly robust expansion of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) could play a major role in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 patients.5 Thus, a detailed characterization of the associations between humoral immune responses and inflammatory factors could result in a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2-host interactions in COVID-19 patients.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00551-1"

However, it remains unclear whether TNF-[alpha]-activated TNFR1 and TNFR2 are regulated by extracellular factors. Here, we showed that soluble glycosylated interleukin-17 receptor D (sIL-17RD), which was produced by proteolytic cleavage, enhanced TNF-[alpha]-induced RA. We revealed that IL-17RD shedding was induced by the proteolytic enzyme TACE and enhanced by TNF-[alpha] expression in macrophages. Intriguingly, sIL-17RD was elevated in the sera of arthritic mice and rats. Recombinant sIL-17RD significantly enhanced the TNF-[alpha]-induced proinflammatory response by promoting TNF-[alpha]-TNFR-sIL-17RD complex formation and receptor clustering, leading to the accelerated development of collagen-induced arthritis. Our observations revealed that ectodomain shedding of IL-17RD occurred in RA to boost the TNF-[alpha]-induced inflammatory response. Targeting sIL-17RD may provide a new strategy for the therapy of RA.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00548-w"

However, whether LXRs play a role in thymocyte development remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrated that LXR[beta] deficiency caused a reduction in single-positive (SP) thymocytes, whereas the transitions from the double-negative to SP stage were normal. Meanwhile, LXR[beta]-null SP thymocytes exhibited increased apoptosis and impairment of the IL-7R[alpha]-Bcl2 axis. In addition, the LXR agonist T0901317 promoted the survival of SP thymocytes with enhanced IL-7R[alpha] expression in wild-type mice but not in LXR[beta]-deficient mice. Mechanistically, LXR[beta] positively regulated the expression of IL-7R[alpha] via direct binding to the Il7r allele in SP thymocytes, and forced expression of IL-7R[alpha] or Bcl2 restored the survival of LXR[beta]-defective SP thymocytes. Thus, our results indicate that LXR[beta] functions as an important transcription factor upstream of IL-7R[alpha] to promote the survival of SP thymocytes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00546-y"
"cmi","The innate immune effector ISG12a promotes cancer immunity by suppressing the canonical Wnt/[beta]-catenin signaling pathway","The ability to harness innate immunity is a promising solution for improving cancer immunotherapy. Interferon (IFN) induces expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) by activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway to promote innate immunity and inhibit malignant tumor growth, but the functions and mechanisms of most ISGs in cancer regulation are unknown. As an innate immune effector, ISG12a promotes the innate immune response to viral infection. In this study, ISG12a was found to be expressed at low levels in gastrointestinal cancer, represented by hepatocellular cancer (HCC) and gastric cancer (GC), and it identified as a tumor suppressor that affects clinical prognosis. ISG12a silencing accelerated the malignant transformation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of cancer cells. Mechanistically, ISG12a promoted [beta]-catenin proteasomal degradation by inhibiting the degradation of ubiquitinated Axin, thereby suppressing the canonical Wnt/[beta]-catenin signaling pathway. Notably, [beta]-catenin was identified as a transcription factor for PD-L1. Inhibition of Wnt/[beta]-catenin signaling by ISG12a suppressed expression of the immune checkpoint PD-L1, rendering cancer cells sensitive to NK cell-mediated killing. This study reveals a mechanism underlying the anticancer effects of IFN. Some ISGs, as represented by ISG12a, may be useful in cancer therapy and prevention. The identified interrelations among innate immunity, Wnt/[beta]-catenin signaling, and cancer immunity may provide new insight into strategies that will improve the efficiency of immunotherapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00549-9"

Reports are accumulating of recurrent viral RNA-positive (RP) nasopharyngeal or anal specimens from recovered patients in China, Italy, South Korea, and France.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 Two cohort studies reported that 14.5% (38/262) and 16.7% (69/414) of patients with COVID-19 retesting were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA after discharge.2,6 The potential causes of RP specimens may be related to several aspects, such as virological factors, including residual viral reservoir, intermittent viral release, tissue distribution or false negatives, as well as immunological and sampling methodological factors.3,9,10 Given that an increasing number of RP cases have been reported worldwide, this phenomenon cannot be simply ascribed to false-negative testing. It indeed occurs, as truly discharged patients could suffer reactivation or could be reinfected with SARS-CoV-2.3 The risk of possible retransmission still exists, and the serological characteristics remain largely unknown, which could jeopardize the management of recovered COVID-19 patients.11","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00528-0"

Due to their HLA-independent mode of action, allogeneic V[gamma]9V[delta]2 T cells can be considered for clinical application. To apply allogeneic V[gamma]9V[delta]2 T cells in adoptive immunotherapy, the methodology used to obtain adequate cell numbers with optimal effector function in vitro needs to be optimized, and clinical safety and efficacy also need to be proven. Therefore, we developed a novel formula to improve the expansion of peripheral [gamma][delta] T cells from healthy donors. Then, we used a humanized mouse model to validate the therapeutic efficacy of expanded [gamma][delta] T cells in vivo; furthermore, the expanded [gamma][delta] T cells were adoptively transferred into late-stage liver and lung cancer patients. We found that the expanded cells possessed significantly improved immune effector functions, including proliferation, differentiation, and cancer cell killing, both in vitro and in the humanized mouse model. Furthermore, a phase I clinical trial in 132 late-stage cancer patients with a total of 414 cell infusions unequivocally validated the clinical safety of allogeneic V[gamma]9V[delta]2 T cells. Among these 132 patients, 8 liver cancer patients and 10 lung cancer patients who received >=5 cell infusions showed greatly prolonged survival, which preliminarily verified the efficacy of allogeneic V[gamma]9V[delta]2 T-cell therapy. Our clinical studies underscore the safety and efficacy of allogeneic V[gamma]9V[delta]2 T-cell immunotherapy, which will inspire further clinical investigations and eventually benefit cancer patients.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0515-7"
"cmi","Macrophages and the maintenance of homeostasis","There have been many chapters written about macrophage polarization. These chapters generally focus on the role of macrophages in orchestrating immune responses by highlighting the T-cell-derived cytokines that shape these polarizing responses. This bias toward immunity is understandable, given the importance of macrophages to host defense. However, macrophages are ubiquitous and are involved in many different cellular processes, and describing them as immune cells is undoubtedly an oversimplification. It disregards their important roles in development, tissue remodeling, wound healing, angiogenesis, and metabolism, to name just a few processes. In this chapter, we propose that macrophages function as transducers in the body. According to Wikipedia, “A transducer is a device that converts energy from one form to another.” The word transducer is a term used to describe both the “sensor,” which can interpret a wide range of energy forms, and the “actuator,” which can switch voltages or currents to affect the environment. Macrophages are able to sense a seemingly endless variety of inputs from their environment and transduce these inputs into a variety of different response outcomes. Thus, rather than functioning as immune cells, they should be considered more broadly as cellular transducers that interpret microenvironmental changes and actuate vital tissue responses. In this chapter, we will describe some of the sensory stimuli that macrophages perceive and the responses they make to these stimuli to achieve their prime directive, which is the maintenance of homeostasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00541-3"

Most COVID-19 infections are mild or even asymptomatic, but the poor prognosis of severe or critically ill patients is still a major challenge. The host immune response is a key determinant for viral clearance. Accumulating evidence suggests that typical lymphopenia and cytokine release syndrome are two features that predict poor prognosis in COVID-19.3 In particular, the levels of blood interleukin-6 (IL-6) are closely correlated with the severity of COVID-19 and have been considered an independent biomarker for predicting poor prognosis.4 However, the sources and dynamics of increased IL-6 in COVID-19 patients remain largely unknown. Here, we reported that septic shock or sepsis was strongly associated with a dramatic rise in blood IL-6 in critical cases and further demonstrated maximal IL-6 levels over a certain threshold as a powerful biomarker for fatal outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00522-6"

In addition, Tregs that reside or accumulate in nonlymphoid tissues, called tissue Tregs, exhibit tissue-specific functions and contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and repair. In an experimental mouse model of crescentic glomerulonephritis induced by an anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, Tregs started to accumulate in the kidney on day 10 of disease onset and remained at high levels (~30-35% of CD4+ T cells) during the late stage (days 21-90), which correlated with stable disease control. Treg depletion on day 21 resulted in the relapse of renal dysfunction and an increase in Th1 cells, suggesting that Tregs are essential for disease control during the convalescence stage. The Tregs that accumulated in the kidney showed tissue Treg phenotypes, including high expression of GATA3, ST2 (the IL33 receptor subunit), amphiregulin (Areg), and PPAR[gamma]. Although T-bet+ Tregs and ROR[gamma]t+ Tregs were observed in the kidney, GATA3+ Tregs were predominant during the convalescence stage, and a PPAR[gamma] agonist enhanced the accumulation of GATA3+ Tregs in the kidney. To understand the function of specific genes in kidney Tregs, we developed a novel T cell transfer system to T cell-deficient mice. This experiment demonstrates that ST2, Areg, and CCR4 in Tregs play important roles in the accumulation of GATA3+ Tregs in the kidney and in the amelioration of renal injury. Our data suggest that GATA3 is important for the recruitment of Tregs into the kidney, which is necessary for convalescence after renal tissue destruction.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00547-x"

An altered distribution of B-cell subsets is usually observed in chronic viral infections, including hepatitis C and B3,4 and HIV.5 In an effort to identify characteristic changes that may be associated with favorable or poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19, we studied peripheral blood B-cell subsets in 17 patients presenting with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection and interstitial pneumonia with a viral RNA-positive nasopharyngeal swab or bronchoalveolar lavage. All were admitted to the hospital because of severe dyspnea requiring at least a Venturi type of mask for oxygen ventilation.

Recent studies of human tissues and blood samples have established a new subset of CD4+ B helper T cells named peripheral helper T (Tph) cells. Unlike T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which interact with B cells within lymphoid organs, Tph cells provide help to B cells within inflamed tissues. Tph cells share many B helper-associated functions with Tfh cells and induce B cell differentiation toward antibody-producing cells. The differentiation mechanism is also partly shared between Tph and Tfh cells in humans, and both Tfh and Tph cells can be found within the same tissues, including cancer tissues. However, Tph cells display features distinct from those of Tfh cells, such as the expression of chemokine receptors associated with Tph cell localization within inflamed tissues and a low Bcl-6/Blimp1 ratio. Unlike that of Tfh cells, current evidence shows that the target of Tph cells is limited to memory B cells. In this review, we first summarize recent findings on human Tph cells and discuss how Tph and Tfh cells play shared and distinct roles in human diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00529-z"

However, the adverse side effects associated with agonist antibodies have hindered their clinical development. Here, we aimed to study the immune-related adverse events of repeated doses and long-term use of agonistic anti-4-1BB mAbs. We show that chronic activation of 4-1BB signals induced the accumulation of IFN-[gamma]-producing PD-1+CD8+ T cells in the secondary lymphoid organs of tumor-bearing mice by increasing the number of dividing CD8+ T cells, which was beneficial for suppressing tumor growth in the early phase of anti-4-1BB induction. However, repeated exposure to anti-4-1BB mAbs led to granuloma development in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) of mice due to recruitment and accumulation of macrophages via the CD8+ T cell-IFN-[gamma] axis. This was accompanied by excessive lymph node swelling, which impaired the sequential activation of CD8+ T cells. Our data provide insights into the immune-related adverse events of long-term agonist 4-1BB antibody dosing, which should be considered during the clinical development of immunomodulating therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-00533-3"

The early interactions between Mtb and the host innate immune system largely determine the establishment of TB infection and disease development. Upon infection, host cells detect Mtb through a set of innate immune receptors and launch a range of cellular innate immune events. However, these innate defense mechanisms are extensively modulated by Mtb to avoid host immune clearance. In this review, we describe the emerging role of cytosolic nucleic acid-sensing pathways at the host-Mtb interface and summarize recently revealed mechanisms by which Mtb circumvents host cellular innate immune strategies such as membrane trafficking and integrity, cell death and autophagy. In addition, we discuss the newly elucidated strategies by which Mtb manipulates the host molecular regulatory machinery of innate immunity, including the intranuclear regulatory machinery, the ubiquitin system, and cellular intrinsic immune components. A better understanding of innate immune evasion mechanisms adopted by Mtb will provide new insights into TB pathogenesis and contribute to the development of more effective TB vaccines and therapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0502-z"

Since antigenic information from transformed tissues is rarely unambiguous, we recently introduced novel T-cell-engaging antibody fragments called hemibodies for the combinatorial, ultraprecise targeting of cancer.1 Here, we report the unprecedented enhancement of the plasticity of immunological synapse (IS) formation and variant signaling topology at the cancer cell-T-cell interface induced by hemibodies compared to that induced by BiTEs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0507-7"
"cmi","Ligand recognition by the [gamma][delta] TCR and discrimination between homeostasis and stress conditions","T lymphocytes comprise cells expressing either an [alpha][beta] or a [gamma][delta] TCR. The riddle how [alpha][beta] TCRs are triggered by specific peptides presented in the context of MHC was elucidated some time ago. In contrast, the mechanisms that underlie antigen recognition by [gamma][delta] TCRs are still baffling the scientific community. It is clear that activation of [gamma][delta] TCRs does not necessarily depend on MHC antigen presentation. To date, diverse and largely host-cell-derived molecules have been identified as cognate antigens for the [gamma][delta] TCR. However, for most [gamma][delta] TCRs, the activating ligand is still unknown and many open questions with regard to physiological relevance and generalizable concepts remain. Especially the question of how [gamma][delta] T cells can distinguish homeostatic from stress conditions via their TCR remains largely unresolved. Recent discoveries in the field might have paved the way towards a better understanding of antigen recognition by the [gamma][delta] TCR and have made it conceivable to revise the current knowledge and contextualize the new findings.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0503-y"
"cmi","Cancer immunotherapy with [gamma][delta] T cells: many paths ahead of us","[gamma][delta] T cells play uniquely important roles in stress surveillance and immunity for infections and carcinogenesis. Human [gamma][delta] T cells recognize and kill transformed cells independently of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restriction, which is an essential feature of conventional [alpha][beta] T cells. V[gamma]9V[delta]2 [gamma][delta] T cells, which prevail in the peripheral blood of healthy adults, are activated by microbial or endogenous tumor-derived pyrophosphates by a mechanism dependent on butyrophilin molecules. [gamma][delta] T cells expressing other T cell receptor variable genes, notably V[delta]1, are more abundant in mucosal tissue. In addition to the T cell receptor, [gamma][delta] T cells usually express activating natural killer (NK) receptors, such as NKp30, NKp44, or NKG2D which binds to stress-inducible surface molecules that are absent on healthy cells but are frequently expressed on malignant cells. Therefore, [gamma][delta] T cells are endowed with at least two independent recognition systems to sense tumor cells and to initiate anticancer effector mechanisms, including cytokine production and cytotoxicity. In view of their HLA-independent potent antitumor activity, there has been increasing interest in translating the unique potential of [gamma][delta] T cells into innovative cellular cancer immunotherapies. Here, we discuss recent developments to enhance the efficacy of [gamma][delta] T cell-based immunotherapy. This includes strategies for in vivo activation and tumor-targeting of [gamma][delta] T cells, the optimization of in vitro expansion protocols, and the development of gene-modified [gamma][delta] T cells. It is equally important to consider potential synergisms with other therapeutic strategies, notably checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy, or the (local) activation of innate immunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0504-x"

DP is caused by diabetes-enhanced host immune-inflammatory responses to bacterial insult. In this study, we found that persistently elevated CCL2 levels in combination with proinflammatory monocyte infiltration of periodontal tissues were closely related to DP. Moreover, inhibition of CCL2 by oral administration of bindarit reduced alveolar bone loss and increased periodontal epithelial thickness by suppressing periodontal inflammation. Furthermore, bindarit suppressed the infiltration of proinflammatory monocytes and altered the inflammatory properties of macrophages in the diabetic periodontium. This finding provides a basis for the development of an effective therapeutic approach for treating DP.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0500-1"

"cmi","Identification of druggable inhibitory immune checkpoints on Natural Killer cells in COVID-19","Infection with SARS-COV-2 is the cause of COVID-19 and has generated an unprecedented health crisis worldwide. While most of the patients experience mild symptoms, around 20% develop severe disease, characterized by pneumonia and in the worst cases by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).1 The analysis and understanding of the immune responses arising in the course of SARS-COV-2 infection may help to propose therapeutic solutions. Due to the crucial role of Natural Killer (NK) cells in antiviral immune responses,2 we analyzed NK cells in blood from a cohort of 82 individuals: 10 healthy controls (HC), 10 paucisymptomatic COVID-19 patients (pauci), 34 patients with pneumonia (pneumo) and 28 patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The absolute numbers of peripheral blood NK cells, B, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocytes were lower in the pneumonia and ARDS groups than in healthy controls, consistent with previously published results3 (Fig. 1a). We investigated the NK cell subsets further and found that among CD45+CD3−CD56+ total NK cells the proportion of mature NK cells, a subset defined on the basis of its expression of the CD16 and CD57 cell surface receptors, was markedly lower in patients with ARDS (Fig. 1b). Given their role in viral infection, the loss of mature NK cells may contribute to the pulmonary complications occurring in the most severe cases of COVID-19. We then focused our analysis on molecular pathways likely to improve NK cell antiviral activity to promote SARS-CoV-2 clearance, and analyzed the expression of several immune checkpoints. Given the availability of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies blocking the immunosuppressive functions of PD-1,4 NKG2A,5 and CD396 initially developed for cancer therapies, we analyzed the expression of these molecules on NK cells in our cohort. PD-1 and NKG2A are cell surface receptors, and their engagement with their ligands, PD-L1 and HLA-E, respectively, inhibits the function of T and NK cells. CD39 is an ectoenzyme that cleaves extracellular ATP and ADP, which can be released from dead cells upon viral infection, leading to the generation of adenosine, which has strong immunosuppressive effects on T and NK cells.Fig. 1COVID-19 is associated with lymphopenia and a dysfunctional NK cell phenotype. a Absolute numbers of circulating NK, B, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells per microliter of peripheral blood from healthy donors and COVID-19 patients. b Left: UMAP projection of concatenated peripheral CD45+CD3−CD56+ NK cells from all samples identifies 3 NK clusters: CD16-CD57−, CD16+CD57− and CD16+CD57+.

"cmi","The history and advances in cancer immunotherapy: understanding the characteristics of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and their therapeutic implications","Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment and rejuvenated the field of tumor immunology. Several types of immunotherapy, including adoptive cell transfer (ACT) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have obtained durable clinical responses, but their efficacies vary, and only subsets of cancer patients can benefit from them. Immune infiltrates in the tumor microenvironment (TME) have been shown to play a key role in tumor development and will affect the clinical outcomes of cancer patients. Comprehensive profiling of tumor-infiltrating immune cells would shed light on the mechanisms of cancer-immune evasion, thus providing opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. However, the highly heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the TME impedes the precise dissection of intratumoral immune cells. With recent advances in single-cell technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry, systematic interrogation of the TME is feasible and will provide insights into the functional diversities of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In this review, we outline the recent progress in cancer immunotherapy, particularly by focusing on landmark studies and the recent single-cell characterization of tumor-associated immune cells, and we summarize the phenotypic diversities of intratumoral immune cells and their connections with cancer immunotherapy. We believe such a review could strengthen our understanding of the progress in cancer immunotherapy, facilitate the elucidation of immune cell modulation in tumor progression, and thus guide the development of novel immunotherapies for cancer treatment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0488-6"
"cmi","Potential contribution of increased soluble IL-2R to lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients","Since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), more than 6 million cases are confirmed and over 300,000 cases are dead after infection. Dysfunction of immunity in COVID-19 patients has been considered as one of the fatal factors for patients, especially cytokine release syndrome and lymphopenia.1,2,3 The reduced number and increased exhaustion level of lymphocyte are associated with elevated inflammatory cytokines in COVID-19 patients.4,5 However, the mechanism of cytokine-induced lymphopenia in COVID-19 is very unclear. IL-2 is critical for the proliferation, differentiation, and function of T cells, including Tregs, CD4+, and CD8+ effector cells.6 Here, we reported the negative relationship between the concentration of soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) and T-cell number in blood from COVID-19 patients. In vitro addition of recombinant CD25 could inhibit the proliferation and function of T cells from PBMC after stimulated with TCR signaling, which could be rescued by strong IL-2 signaling. Our data suggested the importance of IL-2 signaling in lymphopenia of COVID-19 patients.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0484-x"
"cmi","ADAM12 is a costimulatory molecule that determines Th1 cell fate and mediates tissue inflammation","A disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)12 was previously found to be expressed in T cells in the inflamed brain. However, the function of ADAM12 in T-cell responses in general and in tissue inflammation has not been examined. Here, we studied the role of ADAM12 in T-cell responses, fate determination on activation, and its functions in T cells to mediate tissue inflammation. We identified ADAM12 as a costimulatory molecule that is expressed on naive T cells and downregulated on stimulation. ADAM12 mimics CD28 costimulatory signaling to activate and induce the proliferation of T-helper 1 (Th1) cells. Monoclonal ADAM12 Fab antibodies trigger T-cell activation by amplifying TCR signaling to stimulate T-bet-mediated IFN[gamma] production. Lack of genomic ADAM12 and its knockdown in T cells diminished T-bet and IFN[gamma] production in Th1 cells, whereas other T cells, including Th17 cells, were unaffected. ADAM12 had similar functions in vivo on myelin antigen (MOG35-55)-induced T-cell activation. We found that genetic loss of ADAM12 profoundly alleviated Th1-mediated neuroinflammation and thus disease severity in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of multiple sclerosis. Transcriptomic profiling of MOG35-55-specific ADAM12−/− T cells revealed differentially expressed genes that are important for T-cell activation, proliferation, and costimulatory signaling and Th1 pathogenicity, consistent with their inability to cause T-cell-mediated skin inflammation in a model of adoptive delayed-type hypersensitivity. We conclude that ADAM12 is a T-cell costimulatory molecule that contributes to the pathogenesis of tissue inflammation and a potential target for the treatment of Th1-mediated diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0486-8"

At present, the other pharmacological functions of ticagrelor remain poorly understood. The NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a critical role in the innate immune system, but its excessive activation also contributes to the pathogenesis of complex diseases. In this study, we systematically examined the effects of ticagrelor on the NLRP3 inflammasome and found that ticagrelor inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages independent of its classic inhibitory effect on the P2Y12 signaling pathway. Further mechanistic studies demonstrate that ticagrelor attenuates the oligomerization of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) by blocking chloride efflux, an effect achieved through the degradation of chloride intracellular channel proteins (CLICs) and blockade of the translocation of CLICs to the plasma membrane. Moreover, experiments on lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis and alum-induced peritonitis in mice confirmed that ticagrelor mitigates the severity of systemic inflammation independent of P2Y12 receptor antagonism. Importantly, oral administration of ticagrelor rapidly and strongly inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with acute coronary syndrome. Overall, our study reveals a novel pharmacological function of ticagrelor in addition to its classic antiplatelet properties, which suggests that ticagrelor may serve as a potential therapeutic agent for use in NLRP3-associated diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0444-5"
"cmi","Regulation of natural killer cell activity by glucocorticoids, serotonin, dopamine, and epinephrine","The immune system and the nervous system are highly complex organs composed of various different cells that must interact with each other for proper function of the system. This communication can be mediated by soluble factors. The factors released by the nervous system (neurotransmitters) differ from those released by the immune system (cytokines). Nevertheless, the nervous and immune systems can influence each other's activity because immune cells express neurotransmitter receptors, and neurons express cytokine receptors. Moreover, immune cells can synthesize and release neurotransmitters themselves, thus using neurotransmitter-mediated pathways via autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that are important for early and effective immune reactions against infections and cancer. Many studies have shown the strong influence of stress and the nervous system on NK cell activity. This phenomenon may be one reason why chronic stress leads to a higher incidence of infections and cancer. Here, we review the effects of neuroendocrine factors on the different activities of NK cells. Understanding the effects of neuroendocrine factors on NK cell activities during physiological and pathophysiological conditions may result in novel therapeutic strategies to enhance NK cell functions against tumors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0477-9"

Using the avian-derived B cell line DT40, we previously developed an antibody display technology, namely, the ADLib system, which rapidly generates antigen-specific mAbs. Here, we report the development of a human version of the ADLib system and showcase the streamlined generation and optimization of functional human mAbs. Tailored libraries were first constructed by replacing endogenous immunoglobulin genes with designed human counterparts. From these libraries, clones producing full-length human IgGs against distinct antigens can be isolated, as exemplified by the selection of antagonistic mAbs. Taking advantage of avian biology, effective affinity maturation was achieved in a straightforward manner by seamless diversification of the parental clones into secondary libraries followed by single-cell sorting, quickly affording mAbs with improved affinities and functionalities. Collectively, we demonstrate that the human ADLib system could serve as an integrative platform with unique diversity for rapid de novo generation and optimization of therapeutic or diagnostic antibody leads. Furthermore, our results suggest that libraries can be constructed by introducing exogenous genes into DT40 cells, indicating that the ADLib system has the potential to be applied for the rapid and effective directed evolution and optimization of proteins in various fields beyond biomedicine.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0440-9"

The viral spike protein binds the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor-binding domain (RBD), and thus is believed to be a major target to block viral entry. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share this mechanism. Here we functionally analyzed the key amino acid residues located within receptor binding motif of RBD that may interact with human ACE2 and available neutralizing antibodies. The in vivo experiments showed that immunization with either the SARS-CoV RBD or SARS-CoV-2 RBD was able to induce strong clade-specific neutralizing antibodies in mice; however, the cross-neutralizing activity was much weaker, indicating that there are distinct antigenic features in the RBDs of the two viruses. This finding was confirmed with the available neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. It is worth noting that a newly developed SARS-CoV-2 human antibody, HA001, was able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, but failed to recognize SARS-CoV. Moreover, the potential epitope residues of HA001 were identified as A475 and F486 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, representing new binding sites for neutralizing antibodies. Overall, our study has revealed the presence of different key epitopes between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which indicates the necessity to develop new prophylactic vaccine and antibody drugs for specific control of the COVID-19 pandemic although the available agents obtained from the SARS-CoV study are unneglectable.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0458-z"

However, the mechanisms by which irradiated cells function as immunogenic tumor vaccines and induce effective antitumor responses have not been fully explored. Here, we demonstrate that oxidized mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling play a key roles in the enhanced antitumor effect achieved with an irradiated tumor cell vaccine. Elevations in ROS and oxidized mtDNA 8-OHG content could be induced in irradiated tumor cells. Oxidized mtDNA derived from irradiated tumor cells gained access to the cytosol of dendritic cells (DCs). Oxidized mtDNA, as a DAMP or adjuvant, activated the STING-TBK1-IRF3-IFN-[beta] pathway in DCs, which subsequently cross-presented irradiated tumor cell-derived antigens to CD8+ T cells and elicited antitumor immunity. The results of our study provide insight into the mechanism by which an irradiated cell vaccine mediates antitumor immunity, which may have implications for new strategies to improve the efficacy of irradiated vaccines.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0456-1"

However, locoregional treatment of primary tumors often results in distant progression, including lung metastasis, the most common type of visceral metastasis. As a minimally invasive thermal therapy, microwave ablation (MWA) has been attempted in the treatment of breast cancer, but the innate immune response after MWA has not yet been reported. Using two murine models of stage IV breast cancer, we found that MWA of primary breast cancer inhibited the progression of lung metastasis and improved survival. NK cells were activated after MWA of the primary tumor and exhibited enhanced cytotoxic functions, and the cytotoxic pathways of NK cells were activated. Depletion experiments showed that NK cells but not CD4+ or CD8+ T cells played a pivotal role in prolonging survival. Then, we found that compared with surgery or control treatment, MWA of the primary tumor induced completely different NK-cell-related cytokine profiles. Macrophages were activated after MWA of the primary tumor and produced IL-15 that activated NK cells to inhibit the progression of metastasis. In addition, MWA of human breast cancer stimulated an autologous NK-cell response. These results demonstrate that MWA of the primary tumor in metastatic breast cancer inhibits metastatic progression via the macrophage/IL-15/NK-cell axis. MWA of the primary tumor may be a promising treatment strategy for de novo stage IV breast cancer, although further substantiation is essential for clinical testing.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0449-0"

Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel strategies to shorten TB treatment regimens and to treat drug-resistant TB. Using an albumin-fusion strategy, we created a novel albumin-fused granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (albGM-CSF) molecule that harnesses albumin's long half-life and targeting abilities to enhance the biostability of GM-CSF and direct it to the lymph nodes, where the effects of GM-CSF can increase dendritic cell populations crucial for eliciting a potent immune response. In this study, we demonstrate that albGM-CSF serves as a novel immunotherapy for chronic Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infections by enhancing GM-CSF biostability in serum. Specifically, albumin is very safe, stable, and has a long half-life, thereby enhancing the biostability of GM-CSF. In the lungs and draining lymph nodes, albGM-CSF is able to increase the numbers of dendritic cells, which are crucial for the activation of naive T cells and for eliciting potent immune responses. Subcutaneous administration of albGM-CSF alone reduced the mean lung bacillary burden in mice with chronic tuberculosis infection. While GM-CSF administration was associated with IL-1[beta] release from Mtb-infected dendritic cells and macrophages, higher IL-1[beta] levels were observed in albGM-CSF-treated mice with chronic tuberculosis infection than in mice receiving GM-CSF. Albumin fusion with GM-CSF represents a promising strategy for the control of chronic lung tuberculosis infections and serves as a novel therapeutic vaccination platform for other infectious diseases and malignancies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0439-2"

"cmi","Cannabinoids drive Th17 cell differentiation in patients with rheumatic autoimmune diseases","The legalization of cannabinoids for medical use has reinforced their emerging role as a treatment of chronic pain in patients with cancer or rheumatic diseases.1,2 In addition to their role as pain relievers, evidence obtained from animal models suggests that cannabinoids have immunosuppressive properties.3 However, a definite immunosuppressive function of cannabinoids has not yet been confirmed in clinical trials.4 We therefore analyzed the influence of the cannabis derivative cannabidiol (CBD) and the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide (AEA) on T helper type 17 (Th17) cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Interestingly, in vitro culture in the presence of CBD significantly increased Th17 cell differentiation in CD4+ T cells from the peripheral blood of patients with RA, SLE, or PsA, while Th17 cell differentiation was suppressed in healthy individuals (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1A). In RA patients, the median Th17 cell frequency in CBD-treated cells was 6.54 +/- 0.52 vs. 3.27 +/- 0.23 in the vehicle control group (p < 0.0001), and in healthy controls, the frequency was 1.86 +/- 0.25 in CBD-treated cells vs. 3.62 +/- 0.32 in the vehicle control group (p = 0.0002). AEA showed similar effects on CD4+ T cells from patients but did not affect CD4+ T cells from healthy controls (Fig. 1a). The addition of the Th17 skewing cytokines transforming growth factor-[beta], interleukin (IL)-1[beta], IL-6, and IL-23 further increased the Th17-inducing properties of CBD (Fig. 1b). As shown previously in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice, the production of interferon-[gamma] and tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] was reduced in the presence of CBD in patients with rheumatic diseases, as well as in healthy individuals (Supplementary Fig. S1B, C). During our study, some of our RA patients reported the use or planned use of CBD oil as a pain reliever. In these cases, we compared Th17 cell frequencies before and after treatment initialization and found that treatment with CBD oil for 4-8 weeks drove Th17 cell expansion in vivo (1.10 +/- 0.32 before vs. 4.52 +/- 1.34 after CBD treatment; Fig. 1c). Interestingly, disease activity measured by Disease Activity Score 28-joint count C reactive protein significantly increased during CBD treatment (Fig. 1d). In accordance with previous reports, this immunomodulatory effect of CBD was not mediated by the receptors CB1, CB2, or GPR55 (Supplementary Fig. S2A).5 To further assess the characteristics of the CBD-induced Th17 cells, we analyzed their gene expression profiles and discovered a CBD-mediated increase in SGK1 expression (Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. S2C). This is remarkable, as SGK1 is an important regulator of the reciprocal development of proinflammatory Th17 cells.6 In addition, the expression of CSF2 was decreased and the expression of AHR was increased by CBD (Fig. 1f-g  and Supplementary Fig. S2B, C).Fig. 1Cannabinoids induce Th17 cell differentiation in patients with rheumatic diseases. a Expression of IL-17A in CD4+ T cells from healthy controls and patients was analyzed by flow cytometry (HC, n = 13; RA, n = 36; SLE, n = 5, PsA, n = 5). b CBD-mediated induction of IL-17A expression in CD4+ T cells from RA patients in the presence of TGF[beta], IL-1[beta], IL-6, and IL-23 (n = 12). c Increase in IL-17A-positive Th17 cells in patients receiving cannabidiol oil for 4-8 weeks (n = 5). d DAS28-CRP in patients receiving cannabidiol oil for 4-8 weeks (n = 5). e-g Heat maps showing gene expression in RA patients treated with CBD or AEA.

This disease can progress quickly, and 2-3% of patients die within a short time, which is generally due to multiple organ failure.4,5,6,7 Clinically, COVID-19 patients are classified into mild, moderate, severe, and critical cases.5,6,7 The immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is probably linked to the severity of disease. Recently, Zheng et al.8 showed that elevated levels of T-cell exhaustion and reduced functional diversity of T cells in peripheral blood may predict severe progression in COVID-19 patients; however, a more comprehensive understanding of the pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains to be delineated.

"cmi","Glutamate triggers the expression of functional ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors in mast cells","Mast cells are emerging as players in the communication between peripheral nerve endings and cells of the immune system. However, it is not clear the mechanism by which mast cells communicate with peripheral nerves. We previously found that mast cells located within healing tendons can express glutamate receptors, raising the possibility that mast cells may be sensitive to glutamate signaling. To evaluate this hypothesis, we stimulated primary mast cells with glutamate and showed that glutamate induced the profound upregulation of a panel of glutamate receptors of both the ionotropic type (NMDAR1, NMDAR2A, and NMDAR2B) and the metabotropic type (mGluR2 and mGluR7) at both the mRNA and protein levels. The binding of glutamate to glutamate receptors on the mast cell surface was confirmed. Further, glutamate had extensive effects on gene expression in the mast cells, including the upregulation of pro-inflammatory components such as IL-6 and CCL2. Glutamate also induced the upregulation of transcription factors, including Egr2, Egr3 and, in particular, FosB. The extensive induction of FosB was confirmed by immunofluorescence assessment. Glutamate receptor antagonists abrogated the responses of the mast cells to glutamate, supporting the supposition of a functional glutamate-glutamate receptor axis in mast cells. Finally, we provide in vivo evidence supporting a functional glutamate-glutamate receptor axis in the mast cells of injured tendons. Together, these findings establish glutamate as an effector of mast cell function, thereby introducing a novel principle for how cells in the immune system can communicate with nerve cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0421-z"
"cmi","Default polyfunctional T helper 1 response to ample signal 1 alone","CD4+ T cells integrate well-defined signals from the T-cell receptor (TCR) (signal 1) and a host of costimulatory molecules (signal 2) to initiate clonal expansion and differentiation into diverse functional T helper (Th) subsets. However, our ability to guide the expansion of context-appropriate Th subsets by deploying these signals in vaccination remains limited. Using cell-based vaccines, we selectively amplified signal 1 by exclusive presentation of an optimized peptide:MHC II (pMHC II) complex in the absence of classic costimulation. Contrary to expectations, amplified signal 1 alone was strongly immunogenic and selectively expanded high-affinity TCR clonotypes, despite delivering intense TCR signals. In contrast to natural infection or standard vaccines, amplified signal 1, presented by a variety of professional and nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), induced exclusively polyfunctional Th1 effector and memory cells, which protected against retroviral infection and tumor challenge, and expanded tumor-reactive CD4+ T cells otherwise rendered unresponsive in tumor-bearing hosts. Together, our findings uncover a default Th1 response to ample signal 1 and offer a means to selectively prime such protective responses by vaccination.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0415-x"

Rab44 is a large Rab-GTPase that contains a Rab-GTPase domain and some additional N-terminal domains.6,7 Here, we investigated the role of Rab44 in the physiology of mast cells and in anaphylaxis. Rab44 was expressed as two isoforms in murine bone-marrow mast cells (BMMCs), both of which were deleted in Rab44-knockout mice. The Rab44-knockout mice exhibited diminished anaphylaxis, and the Rab44-knockout BMMCs showed a decrease in Fc[epsilon]RI-mediated histamine and [beta]-hexosaminidase secretion. Thus, Rab44 regulates granule exocytosis in mast cells and IgE-mediated anaphylaxis in mice.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0413-z"
"cmi","SPOP negatively regulates Toll-like receptor-induced inflammation by disrupting MyD88 self-association","Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways need to be tightly controlled to avoid excessive inflammation and unwanted damage to the host. Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) is a critical adaptor of TLR signaling. Here, we identified the speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) as a MyD88-associated protein. SPOP was recruited to MyD88 following TLR4 activation. TLR4 activation also caused the translocation of SPOP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. SPOP depletion promoted the aggregation of MyD88 and recruitment of the downstream signaling kinases IRAK4, IRAK1 and IRAK2. Consistently, overexpression of SPOP inhibited the TLR4-mediated activation of NF-[kappa]B and production of inflammatory cytokines, whereas SPOP depletion had the opposite effects. Furthermore, knockdown of SPOP increased MyD88 aggregation and inflammatory cytokine production upon TLR2, TLR7 and TLR9 activation. Our findings reveal a mechanism by which MyD88 is regulated and highlight a role for SPOP in limiting inflammatory responses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0411-1"

"cmi","Therapeutic ACPA inhibits NET formation: a potential therapy for neutrophil-mediated inflammatory diseases","Excessive release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) is associated with disease severity and contributes to tissue injury, followed by severe organ damage. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of NET release reduces pathology in multiple inflammatory disease models, indicating that NETs are potential therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate using a preclinical basket approach that our therapeutic anti-citrullinated protein antibody (tACPA) has broad therapeutic potential. Treatment with tACPA prevents disease symptoms in various mouse models with plausible NET-mediated pathology, including inflammatory arthritis (IA), pulmonary fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease and sepsis. We show that citrulline residues in the N-termini of histones 2A and 4 are specific targets for therapeutic intervention, whereas antibodies against other N-terminal post-translational histone modifications have no therapeutic effects. Because citrullinated histones are generated during NET release, we investigated the ability of tACPA to inhibit NET formation. tACPA suppressed NET release from human neutrophils triggered with physiologically relevant human disease-related stimuli. Moreover, tACPA diminished NET release and potentially initiated NET uptake by macrophages in vivo, which was associated with reduced tissue damage in the joints of a chronic arthritis mouse model of IA. To our knowledge, we are the first to describe an antibody with NET-inhibiting properties and thereby propose tACPA as a drug candidate for NET-mediated inflammatory diseases, as it eliminates the noxious triggers that lead to continued inflammation and tissue damage in a multidimensional manner.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0381-3"

The CoV spike (S) protein plays the most important roles in viral attachment, fusion and entry, and serves as a target for development of antibodies, entry inhibitors and vaccines.

SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV RBD and could block the binding and, hence, attachment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2-expressing cells, thus inhibiting their infection to host cells. SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies could cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, and SARS-CoV RBD-induced antisera could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the potential to develop SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccines for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0400-4"

Specifically, memory CD8 T cells engage oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation to fulfill their metabolic demands. In contrast, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) display severe metabolic defects, which may underlie their functional decline. Here, we show that overexpression of proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1[alpha]), the master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis (MB), favors CD8 T cell central memory formation rather than resident memory generation. PGC-1[alpha]-overexpressing CD8 T cells persist and mediate more robust recall responses to bacterial infection or peptide vaccination. Importantly, CD8 T cells with enhanced PGC-1[alpha] expression provide stronger antitumor immunity in a mouse melanoma model. Moreover, TILs overexpressing PGC-1[alpha] maintain higher mitochondrial activity and improved expansion when rechallenged in a tumor-free host.

"cmi","The deubiquitinase OTUB1 augments NF-[kappa]B-dependent immune responses in dendritic cells in infection and inflammation by stabilizing UBC13","Dendritic cells (DCs) are indispensable for defense against pathogens but may also contribute to immunopathology. Activation of DCs upon the sensing of pathogens by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) is largely mediated by pattern recognition receptor/nuclear factor-[kappa]B (NF-[kappa]B) signaling and depends on the appropriate ubiquitination of the respective signaling molecules. However, the ubiquitinating and deubiquitinating enzymes involved and their interactions are only incompletely understood. Here, we reveal that the deubiquitinase OTU domain, ubiquitin aldehyde binding 1 (OTUB1) is upregulated in DCs upon murine Toxoplasma gondii infection and lipopolysaccharide challenge. Stimulation of DCs with the TLR11/12 ligand T. gondii profilin and the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide induced an increase in NF-[kappa]B activation in OTUB1-competent cells, resulting in elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production, which was also observed upon the specific stimulation of TLR2, TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9. Mechanistically, OTUB1 promoted NF-[kappa]B activity in DCs by K48-linked deubiquitination and stabilization of the E2-conjugating enzyme UBC13, resulting in increased K63-linked ubiquitination of IRAK1 (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1) and TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6). Consequently, DC-specific deletion of OTUB1 impaired the production of cytokines, in particular IL-12, by DCs over the first 2 days of T. gondii infection, resulting in the diminished production of protective interferon-[gamma] (IFN-[gamma]) by natural killer cells, impaired control of parasite replication, and, finally, death from chronic T. encephalitis, all of which could be prevented by low-dose IL-12 treatment in the first 3 days of infection. In contrast, impaired OTUB1-deficient DC activation and cytokine production by OTUB1-deficient DCs protected mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced immunopathology. Collectively, these findings identify OTUB1 as a potent novel regulator of DCs during infectious and inflammatory diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0362-6"
"cmi","B7-H7 (HHLA2) inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation in the presence of TCR and CD28 signaling","Modulation of T-cell responses has played a key role in treating cancers and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, understanding how different receptors on T cells impact functional outcomes is crucial. The influence of B7-H7 (HHLA2) and CD28H (TMIGD2) on T-cell activation remains controversial. Here we examined global transcriptomic changes in human T cells induced by B7-H7. Stimulation through TCR with OKT3 and B7-H7 resulted in modest fold changes in the expression of select genes; however, these fold changes were significantly lower than those induced by OKT3 and B7-1 stimulation. The transcriptional changes induced by OKT3 and B7-H7 were insufficient to provide functional stimulation as measured by evaluating T-cell proliferation and cytokine production. Interestingly, B7-H7 was coinhibitory when simultaneously combined with TCR and CD28 stimulation. This inhibitory activity was comparable to that observed with PD-L1. Finally, in physiological assays using T cells and APCs, blockade of B7-H7 enhanced T-cell activation and proliferation, demonstrating that this ligand acts as a break signal. Our work defines that the transcriptomic changes induced by B7-H7 are insufficient to support full costimulation with TCR signaling and, instead, B7-H7 inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation in the presence of TCR and CD28 signaling.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-020-0361-7"
"cmi","Inflammation-induced inhibition of chaperone-mediated autophagy maintains the immunosuppressive function of murine mesenchymal stromal cells","Macroautophagy has been implicated in modulating the therapeutic function of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). However, the biological function of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) in MSCs remains elusive. Here, we found that CMA was inhibited in MSCs in response to the proinflammatory cytokines interferon-[gamma] (IFN-[gamma]) and tumor necrosis factor-[alpha] (TNF-[alpha]). In addition, suppression of CMA by knocking down the CMA-related lysosomal receptor lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP-2A) in MSCs significantly enhanced the immunosuppressive effect of MSCs on T cell proliferation, and as expected, LAMP-2A overexpression in MSCs exerted the opposite effect on T cell proliferation. This effect of CMA on the immunosuppressive function of MSCs was attributed to its negative regulation of the expression of chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 10 (CXCL10), which recruits inflammatory cells, especially T cells, to MSCs, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which leads to the subsequent inhibition of T cell proliferation via nitric oxide (NO). Mechanistically, CMA inhibition dramatically promoted IFN-[gamma] plus TNF-[alpha]-induced activation of NF-[kappa]B and STAT1, leading to the enhanced expression of CXCL10 and iNOS in MSCs. Furthermore, we found that IFN-[gamma] plus TNF-[alpha]-induced AKT activation contributed to CMA inhibition in MSCs. More interestingly, CMA-deficient MSCs exhibited improved therapeutic efficacy in inflammatory liver injury. Taken together, our findings established CMA inhibition as a critical contributor to the immunosuppressive function of MSCs induced by inflammatory cytokines and highlighted a previously unknown function of CMA.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0345-7"

A mechanistic study of microgravity-regulated immune cell function is necessary to overcome this challenge. Here, we demonstrate that both spaceflight (real) and simulated microgravity significantly reduce macrophage differentiation, decrease macrophage quantity and functional polarization, and lead to metabolic reprogramming, as demonstrated by changes in gene expression profiles. Moreover, we identified RAS/ERK/NF[kappa]B as a major microgravity-regulated pathway. Exogenous ERK and NF[kappa]B activators significantly counteracted the effect of microgravity on macrophage differentiation. In addition, microgravity also affects the p53 pathway, which we verified by RT-qPCR and Western blot.

"cmi","CD147 deficiency in T cells prevents thymic involution by inhibiting the EMT process in TECs in the presence of TGF[beta]","Thymic involution during aging is a major cause of decreased T-cell production and reduced immunity. Here, we show that the loss of CD147 on T cells prevents thymic senescence, resulting in slowed shrinkage of the thymus with age and increased production of naive T cells. This phenotype is the result of slowing of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in thymic epithelial cells (TECs), which eventually leads to reduced adipocyte accumulation. In an in vitro coculture system, we found that TGF[beta] is an important factor in the EMT process in TECs and that it can reduce the expression of E-cadherin through p-Smad2/FoxC2 signaling. Moreover, CD147 on T cells can accelerate the decline in E-cadherin expression by interacting with Annexin A2 on TECs. In the presence of TGF[beta], Annexin A2 and E-cadherin colocalize on TECs. However, CD147 on T cells competitively binds to Annexin A2 on TECs, leading to the isolation of E-cadherin. Then, the isolated E-cadherin is easily phosphorylated by phosphorylated Src kinase, the phosphorylation of which was induced by TGF[beta], and finally, p-E-cadherin is degraded. Thus, in the thymus, the interaction between T cells and TECs contributes to thymic involution with age. In this study, we illuminate the mechanism underlying the triggering of the EMT process in TECs and show that inhibiting TGF[beta] and/or CD147 may serve as a strategy to hinder age-related thymic involution.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0353-7"
"cmi","Plasmacytoid dendritic cell deficiency in neonates enhances allergic airway inflammation via reduced production of IFN-[alpha]","Allergic asthma, a chronic inflammatory airway disease associated with type 2 cytokines, often originates in early life. Immune responses at an early age exhibit a Th2 cell bias, but the precise mechanisms remain elusive. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which play a regulatory role in allergic asthma, were shown to be deficient in neonatal mice. We report here that this pDC deficiency renders neonatal mice more susceptible to severe allergic airway inflammation than adult mice in an OVA-induced experimental asthma model. Adoptive transfer of pDCs or administration of IFN-[alpha] to neonatal mice prevented the development of allergic inflammation in wild type but not in IFNAR1−/− mice. Similarly, adult mice developed more severe allergic inflammation when pDCs were depleted. The protective effects of pDCs were mediated by the pDC-/IFN-[alpha]-mediated negative regulation of the secretion of epithelial cell-derived CCL20, GM-CSF, and IL-33, which in turn impaired the recruitment of cDC2 and ILC2 cells to the airway. In asthmatic patients, the percentage of pDCs and the level of IFN-[alpha] were lower in children than in adults. These results indicate that impairment of pDC-epithelial cell crosstalk in neonates is a susceptibility factor for the development of allergen-induced allergic airway inflammation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0333-y"
"cmi","Molecular anatomy and pathogenic actions of Helicobacter pylori CagA that underpin gastric carcinogenesis","Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori cagA-positive strains is the strongest risk factor for gastric cancer. The cagA gene product, CagA, is delivered into gastric epithelial cells via the bacterial type IV secretion system. Delivered CagA then undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at the Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) motifs in its C-terminal region and acts as an oncogenic scaffold protein that physically interacts with multiple host signaling proteins in both tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent and -independent manners. Analysis of CagA using in vitro cultured gastric epithelial cells has indicated that the nonphysiological scaffolding actions of CagA cell-autonomously promote the malignant transformation of the cells by endowing the cells with multiple phenotypic cancer hallmarks: sustained proliferation, evasion of growth suppressors, invasiveness, resistance to cell death, and genomic instability. Transgenic expression of CagA in mice leads to in vivo oncogenic action of CagA without any overt inflammation. The in vivo oncogenic activity of CagA is further potentiated in the presence of chronic inflammation. Since Helicobacter pylori infection triggers a proinflammatory response in host cells, a feedforward stimulation loop that augments the oncogenic actions of CagA and inflammation is created in CagA-injected gastric mucosa. Given that Helicobacter pylori is no longer colonized in established gastric cancer lesions, the multistep nature of gastric cancer development should include a “hit-and-run” process of CagA action. Thus, acquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations that compensate for CagA-directed cancer hallmarks may be required for completion of the “hit-and-run” process of gastric carcinogenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0339-5"
"cmi","Serum-circulating His-tRNA synthetase inhibits organ-targeted immune responses","His-tRNA synthetase (HARS) is targeted by autoantibodies in chronic and acute inflammatory anti-Jo-1-positive antisynthetase syndrome. The extensive activation and migration of immune cells into lung and muscle are associated with interstitial lung disease, myositis, and morbidity. It is unknown whether the sequestration of HARS is an epiphenomenon or plays a causal role in the disease. Here, we show that HARS circulates in healthy individuals, but it is largely undetectable in the serum of anti-Jo-1-positive antisynthetase syndrome patients. In cultured primary human skeletal muscle myoblasts (HSkMC), HARS is released in increasing amounts during their differentiation into myotubes. We further show that HARS regulates immune cell engagement and inhibits CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell activation. In mouse and rodent models of acute inflammatory diseases, HARS administration downregulates immune activation. In contrast, neutralization of extracellular HARS by high-titer antibody responses during tissue injury increases susceptibility to immune attack, similar to what is seen in humans with anti-Jo-1-positive disease. Collectively, these data suggest that extracellular HARS is homeostatic in normal subjects, and its sequestration contributes to the morbidity of the anti-Jo-1-positive antisynthetase syndrome.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0331-0"
"cmi","The intragraft vascularized bone marrow component plays a critical role in tolerance induction after reconstructive transplantation","The role of the vascularized bone marrow component as a continuous source of donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells that facilitate tolerance induction of vascularized composite allografts is not completely understood. In this study, vascularized composite tissue allograft transplantation outcomes between recipients receiving either conventional bone marrow transplantation (CBMT) or vascularized bone marrow (VBM) transplantation from Balb/c (H2d) to C57BL/6 (H2b) mice were compared. Either high- or low-dose CBMT (1.5 × 108 or 3 × 107 bone marrow cells, respectively) was applied. In addition, recipients were treated with costimulation blockade (1 mg anti-CD154 and 0.5 mg CTLA4Ig on postoperative days 0 and 2, respectively) and short-term rapamycin (3 mg/kg/day for the first posttransplant week and then every other day for another 3 weeks). Similar to high-dose conventional bone marrow transplantation, 5/6 animals in the vascularized bone marrow group demonstrated long-term allograft survival (>120 days). In contrast, significantly shorter median survival was noted in the low-dose CBMT group (~64 days). Consistently high chimerism levels were observed in the VBM transplantation group. Notably, low levels of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and a higher ratio of Treg to Teff cells were maintained in VBM transplantation and high-dose CBMT recipients (>30 days) but not in low-dose VBM transplant recipients. Donor-specific hyporesponsiveness was shown in tolerant recipients in vitro. Removal of the vascularized bone marrow component after secondary donor-specific skin transplantation did not affect either primary allograft or secondary skin graft survival.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0325-y"
"cmi","Dendritic cells license regulatory B cells to produce IL-10 and mediate suppression of antigen-specific CD8 T cells","Regulatory B cells (Bregs) suppress and reduce autoimmune pathology. However, given the variety of Breg subsets, the role of Bregs in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes is still unclear. Here, we dissect this fundamental mechanism. We show that natural protection from type 1 diabetes in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice is associated with increased numbers of IL-10-producing B cells, while development of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice occurs in animals with compromised IL-10 production by B cells. However, B cells from diabetic mice regain IL-10 function if activated by the innate immune receptor TLR4 and can suppress insulin-specific CD8 T cells in a dendritic cell (DC)-dependent, IL-10-mediated fashion. Suppression of CD8 T cells is reliant on B-cell contact with DCs. This cell contact results in deactivation of DCs, inducing a tolerogenic state, which in turn can regulate pathogenic CD8 T cells. Our findings emphasize the importance of DC-Breg interactions during the development of type 1 diabetes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0324-z"
"cmi","Jagged1-mediated myeloid Notch1 signaling activates HSF1/Snail and controls NLRP3 inflammasome activation in liver inflammatory injury","Notch signaling plays important roles in the regulation of immune cell functioning during the inflammatory response. Activation of the innate immune signaling receptor NLRP3 promotes inflammation in injured tissue. However, it remains unknown whether Jagged1 (JAG1)-mediated myeloid Notch1 signaling regulates NLRP3 function in acute liver injury. Here, we report that myeloid Notch1 signaling regulates the NLRP3-driven inflammatory response in ischemia/reperfusion (IR)-induced liver injury. In a mouse model of liver IR injury, Notch1-proficient (Notch1FL/FL) mice receiving recombinant JAG1 showed a reduction in IR-induced liver injury and increased Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) expression, whereas myeloid-specific Notch1 knockout (Notch1M-KO) aggravated hepatocellular damage even with concomitant JAG1 treatment. Compared to JAG1-treated Notch1FL/FL controls, Notch1M-KO mice showed diminished HSF1 and Snail activity but augmented NLRP3/caspase-1 activity in ischemic liver. The disruption of HSF1 reduced Snail activation and enhanced NLRP3 activation, while the adoptive transfer of HSF1-expressing macrophages to Notch1M-KO mice augmented Snail activation and mitigated IR-triggered liver inflammation. Moreover, the knockdown of Snail in JAG1-treated Notch1FL/FL livers worsened hepatocellular functioning, reduced TRX1 expression and increased TXNIP/NLRP3 expression. Ablation of myeloid Notch1 or Snail increased ASK1 activation and hepatocellular apoptosis, whereas the activation of Snail increased TRX1 expression and reduced TXNIP, NLRP3/caspase-1, and ROS production. Our findings demonstrated that JAG1-mediated myeloid Notch1 signaling promotes HSF1 and Snail activation, which in turn inhibits NLRP3 function and hepatocellular apoptosis leading to the alleviation of IR-induced liver injury. Hence, the Notch1/HSF1/Snail signaling axis represents a novel regulator of and a potential therapeutic target for liver inflammatory injury.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0318-x"
"cmi","Loss of Lkb1 impairs Treg function and stability to aggravate graft-versus-host disease after bone marrow transplantation","Accumulating evidence suggests that a reduction in the number of Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) contributes to the pathogenesis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), which is a major adverse complication that can occur after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). However, the precise features and mechanism underlying the defects in Tregs remain largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that Tregs were more dramatically decreased in bone marrow compared with those in peripheral blood from aGVHD patients and that bone marrow Treg defects were negatively associated with hematopoietic reconstitution. Tregs from aGVHD patients exhibited multiple defects, including the instability of Foxp3 expression, especially in response to IL-12, impaired suppressor function, decreased migratory capacity, and increased apoptosis. Transcriptional profiling revealed the downregulation of Lkb1, a previously identified critical regulator of murine Treg identity and metabolism, and murine Lkb1-regulated genes in Tregs from aGVHD patients. Foxp3 expression in human Tregs could be decreased and increased by the knockdown and overexpression of the Lkb1 gene, respectively. Furthermore, a loss-of-function assay in an aGVHD murine model confirmed that Lkb1 deficiency could impair Tregs and aggravate disease severity. These findings reveal that Lkb1 downregulation contributes to multiple defects in Tregs in human aGVHD and highlight the Lkb1-related pathways that could serve as therapeutic targets that may potentially be manipulated to mitigate aGVHD.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0312-3"

The differentiation and activation of macrophages require the timely regulation of gene expression, which depends on the interaction of a variety of factors, including transcription factors and epigenetic modifications. Epigenetic changes also give macrophages the ability to switch rapidly between cellular programs, indicating the ability of epigenetic mechanisms to affect phenotype plasticity. In this review, we focus on key epigenetic events associated with macrophage fate, highlighting events related to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, responses to different stimuli and the formation of innate immune memory.

"cmi","Macrophages reprogrammed by lung cancer microparticles promote tumor development via release of IL-1[beta]","Despite their mutual antagonism, inflammation and immunosuppression coexist in tumor microenvironments due to tumor and immune cell interactions, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Previously, we showed that tumor cell-derived microparticles induce an M2 phenotype characterized by immunosuppression in tumor-infiltrating macrophages. Here, we further showed that lung cancer microparticles (L-MPs) induce macrophages to release a key proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1[beta], thus promoting lung cancer development. The underlying mechanism involves the activation of TLR3 and the NLRP3 inflammasome by L-MPs. More importantly, tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment-induced L-MPs also induce human macrophages to release IL-1[beta], leading to a tumor-promoting effect in a humanized mouse model. These findings demonstrated that in addition to their anti-inflammatory effect, L-MPs induce a proinflammatory phenotype in tumor-infiltrating macrophages, promoting the development of inflammatory and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0313-2"

"cmi","Anti-inflammatory mechanisms of the novel cytokine interleukin-38 in allergic asthma","We elucidated the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of IL-38 in allergic asthma. Human bronchial epithelial cells and eosinophils were cocultured upon stimulation with the viral RLR ligand poly (I:C)/LyoVec or infection-related cytokine TNF-[alpha] to induce expression of cytokines/chemokines/adhesion molecules. House dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic asthma and humanized allergic asthma NOD/SCID murine models were established to assess anti-inflammatory mechanisms in vivo. IL-38 significantly inhibited induced proinflammatory IL-6, IL-1[beta], CCL5, and CXCL10 production, and antiviral interferon-[beta] and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression in the coculture system. Mass cytometry and RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that IL-38 could antagonize the activation of the intracellular STAT1, STAT3, p38 MAPK, ERK1/2, and NF-[kappa]B pathways, and upregulate the expression of the host defense-related gene POU2AF1 and anti-allergic response gene RGS13. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-38 into HDM-induced allergic asthma mice could ameliorate airway hyperreactivity by decreasing the accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs and inhibiting the expression of the Th2-related cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung homogenates. Histological examination indicated lung inflammation was alleviated by reductions in cell infiltration and goblet cell hyperplasia, together with reduced Th2, Th17, and innate lymphoid type 2 cell numbers but increased proportions of regulatory T cells in the lungs, spleen, and lymph nodes. IL-38 administration suppressed airway hyperreactivity and asthma-related IL-4 and IL-5 expression in humanized mice, together with significantly decreased CCR3+ eosinophil numbers in the BALF and lungs, and a reduced percentage of human CD4+CRTH2+ Th2 cells in the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes. Together, our results demonstrated the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of IL-38 and provided a basis for the development of a regulatory cytokine-based treatment for allergic asthma.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0300-7"

The non-native conformation of proteins upon accumulation in IBs abrogates their use as vaccines aimed at generating high-affinity antibodies.3 However, IBs exhibit unique properties, including mechanical and thermal stability due to their intrinsic particulate nature, biocompatibility, high antigenic content, low toxicity and relative resistance to proteases.

"cmi","TCR-pMHC bond conformation controls TCR ligand discrimination","A major unanswered question is how a TCR discriminates between foreign and self-peptides presented on the APC surface. Here, we used in situ fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to measure the distances of single TCR-pMHC bonds and the conformations of individual TCR-CD3[zeta] receptors at the membranes of live primary T cells. We found that a TCR discriminates between closely related peptides by forming single TCR-pMHC bonds with different conformations, and the most potent pMHC forms the shortest bond. The bond conformation is an intrinsic property that is independent of the binding affinity and kinetics, TCR microcluster formation, and CD4 binding. The bond conformation dictates the degree of CD3[zeta] dissociation from the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane via a positive calcium signaling feedback loop to precisely control the accessibility of CD3[zeta] ITAMs for phosphorylation. Our data revealed the mechanism by which a TCR deciphers the structural differences among peptides via the TCR-pMHC bond conformation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0273-6"

However, the transcriptional regulation of CTLA-4 is not well understood. Zfp281, a C2H2 zinc finger protein, is a negative regulator of pluripotency maintenance of embryonic stem cells. Nevertheless, the function of Zfp281 in differentiated cells has not been studied. We generated Zfp281 conditional knockout mice in which the function of the Zfp281 gene was conditionally disrupted by the Cd4Cre transgene to study its impact on T cell function. Zfp281 had no effect on T-cell development, but CD4+ T cell activation and cytokine production were impaired due to diminished T-cell receptor signaling. Furthermore, Zfp281 deficiency inhibited in vivo T cell responses to Listeria monocytogenes infection. Using genome-wide expression profiling assays, we determined that Zfp281 repressed Ctla-4 expression by directly binding to GC-rich sites in its promoter, which inhibited the negative feedback of T cell activation. In line with this result, CTLA-4 blockade and shRNA knockdown partly rescued the reduced cytokine production caused by Zfp281 deficiency. These findings indicate that Zfp281 sustains CD4+ T lymphocyte activation by directly repressing Ctla-4 transcription.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0289-y"

However, the expression of Btk in T cells and its role in T-cell function remain largely unknown. Here, we unexpectedly found high expression and activation of BTK in T cells. Deficiencies in BTK resulted in the impaired activation and proliferation of autoreactive T cells and ameliorated bone marrow failure (BMF) in aplastic anemia. Mechanistically, BTK is activated after TCR engagement and then phosphorylates PLC[gamma]1, thus promoting T-cell activation. Treatment with acalabrutinib, a selective BTK inhibitor, decreased T-cell proliferation and ameliorated BMF in mice with aplastic anemia. Our results demonstrate an unexpected role of BTK in optimal T-cell activation and in the pathogenesis of autoimmune aplastic anemia, providing insights into the molecular regulation of T-cell activation and the pathogenesis of T-cell-mediated autoimmune disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0270-9"

This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of regulating miR-142-3p/5p expression in SLE CD4+ T cells. The BCL-6 expression was significantly increased in SLE CD4+ T cells compared with normal controls, and the BCL-6 expression was inversely correlated with miR-142-3p/5p expression. BCL-6 suppresses the expression of miR-142-3p/5p by increasing H3K27me3 level and reducing H3K9/K14ac levels in SLE CD4+ T cells. BCL-6 regulates histone modifications in miR-142 promoter by recruiting EZH2 and HDAC5. Furthermore, we observed significantly decreased CD40L, ICOS, and IL-21 expression levels in SLE CD4+ T cells with BCL-6 interference, and obviously reduced autoantibody IgG production in autologous B cells co-cultured with BCL-6 inhibited SLE CD4+ T cells. Our study found that increased BCL-6 up-regulates H3K27me3 and down-regulates H3K9/14ac at miR-142 promoter in SLE CD4+ T cells.

Interleukin-29 (IL-29), a member of type 3 interferon family, plays a role in host defenses against microbes, however, little is known about its role in metabolic disorders. We explored the function of IL-29 in the pathogenesis of obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance. We found that serum IL-29 level was significantly higher in obese patients. IL-29 upregulated IL-1[beta], IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression and decreased glucose uptake and insulin sensitivity in human Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (SGBS) adipocytes through reducing glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and AKT signals. In addition, IL-29 promoted monocyte/macrophage migration. Inhibition of IL-29 could reduce inflammatory cytokine production in macrophage-adipocyte coculture system, which mimic an obese microenvironment. In vivo, IL-29 reduced insulin sensitivity and increased the number of peritoneal macrophages in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. IL-29 increased M1/M2 macrophage ratio and enhanced MCP-1 expression in adipose tissues of HFD mice. Therefore, we have identified a critical role of IL-29 in obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance, and we conclude that IL-29 may be a novel candidate target for treating obesity and insulin resistance in patients with metabolic disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0262-9"

"cmi","Keratinocytes costimulate naive human T cells via CD2: a potential target to prevent the development of proinflammatory Th1 cells in the skin","The interplay between keratinocytes and immune cells, especially T cells, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory skin diseases. During psoriasis, keratinocytes attract T cells by releasing chemokines, while skin-infiltrating self-reactive T cells secrete proinflammatory cytokines, e.g., IFN[gamma] and IL-17A, that cause epidermal hyperplasia. Similarly, in chronic graft-versus-host disease, allogenic IFN[gamma]-producing Th1/Tc1 and IL-17-producing Th17/Tc17 cells are recruited by keratinocyte-derived chemokines and accumulate in the skin. However, whether keratinocytes act as nonprofessional antigen-presenting cells to directly activate naive human T cells in the epidermis remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that under proinflammatory conditions, primary human keratinocytes indeed activate naive human T cells. This activation required cell contact and costimulatory signaling via CD58/CD2 and CD54/LFA-1. Naive T cells costimulated by keratinocytes selectively differentiated into Th1 and Th17 cells. In particular, keratinocyte-initiated Th1 differentiation was dependent on costimulation through CD58/CD2. The latter molecule initiated STAT1 signaling and IFN[gamma] production in T cells. Costimulation of T cells by keratinocytes resulting in Th1 and Th17 differentiation represents a new explanation for the local enrichment of Th1 and Th17 cells in the skin of patients with a chronic inflammatory skin disease. Consequently, local interference with T cell-keratinocyte interactions may represent a novel strategy for the treatment of Th1 and Th17 cell-driven skin diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0261-x"

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are associated with a greater risk of diabetes. However, the role of GnRH in diabetic wound healing is unclear. We determined whether GnRH-promoted NETosis and induced more severe and delayed diabetic wound healing. A mouse model of diabetes was established using five injections with streptozotocin. Mice with blood glucose levels >250 mg/dL were then used in the experiments. GnRH agonist treatment induced delayed wound healing and increased NETosis at the skin wounds of diabetic mice. In contrast, GnRH antagonist treatment inhibited GnRH agonist-induced delayed wound healing. The expression of NETosis markers PAD4 and citrullinated histone H3 were increased in the GnRH-treated diabetic skin wounds in diabetic mice and patients. In vitro experiments also showed that neutrophils expressed a GnRH receptor and that GnRH agonist treatment increased NETosis markers and promoted phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced NETosis in mouse and human neutrophils. Furthermore, GnRH antagonist treatment suppressed the expression of NETosis markers and PMA-induced NETosis, which were increased by GnRH treatment. These results indicated that GnRH-promoted NETosis and that increased NETosis induced delayed wound healing in diabetic skin wounds. Thus, inhibition of GnRH might be a novel treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0252-y"

Potential applications include the adoptive transfer of in vitro-expanded [gamma][delta] T cells. Therefore, it is important to optimize the culture conditions to enable maximal proliferative and functional activity. Vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) is an essential vitamin with multiple effects on immune cells. It is a cofactor for several enzymes, has antioxidant activity, and is an epigenetic modifier. Here, we investigated the effects of vitamin C (VC) and its more stable derivative, L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (pVC), on the proliferation and effector function of human [gamma][delta] T cells stimulated with zoledronate (ZOL) or synthetic phosphoantigens (pAgs). VC and pVC did not increase [gamma][delta] T-cell expansion within ZOL- or pAg-stimulated PBMCs, but increased the proliferation of purified [gamma][delta] T cells and 14-day-expanded [gamma][delta] T-cell lines in response to [gamma][delta] T-cell-specific pAgs. VC reduced the apoptosis of [gamma][delta] T cells during primary stimulation. While pVC did not prevent activation-induced death of pAg-restimulated [gamma][delta] T cells, it enhanced the cell cycle progression and cellular expansion. Furthermore, VC and pVC enhanced cytokine production during primary activation, as well as upon pAg restimulation of 14-day-expanded [gamma][delta] T cells. VC and pVC also increased the oxidative respiration and glycolysis of [gamma][delta] T cells, but stimulus-dependent differences were observed. The modulatory activity of VC and pVC might help to increase the efficacy of [gamma][delta] T-cell expansion for adoptive immunotherapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0247-8"
"cmi","Spatial distribution of IL4 controls iNKT cell-DC crosstalk in tumors","The spatiotemporal distribution of cytokines orchestrates immune responses in vivo, yet the underlying mechanisms remain to be explored. We showed here that the spatial distribution of interleukin-4 (IL4) in invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells regulated crosstalk between iNKT cells and dendritic cells (DCs) and controlled iNKT cell-mediated T-helper type 1 (Th1) responses. The persistent polarization of IL4 induced by strong lipid antigens, that is, [alpha]-galactosylceramide ([alpha]GC), caused IL4 accumulation at the immunological synapse (IS), which promoted the activation of the IL4R-STAT6 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 6) pathway and production of IL12 in DCs, which enhanced interferon-[gamma] (IFN[gamma]) production in iNKT cells. Conversely, the nonpolarized secretion of IL4 induced by Th2 lipid antigens with a short or unsaturated chain was incapable of enhancing this iNKT cell-DC crosstalk and thus shifted the immune response to a Th2-type response. The nonpolarized secretion of IL4 in response to Th2 lipid antigens was caused by the degradation of Cdc42 in iNKT cells. Moreover, reduced Cdc42 expression was observed in tumor-infiltrating iNKT cells, which impaired IL4 polarization and disturbed iNKT cell-DC crosstalk in tumors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0243-z"
"cmi","Specific contribution of mannose-binding lectin murine isoforms to brain ischemia/reperfusion injury","Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), an initiator of the lectin pathway (LP) of complement activation, is detrimental in ischemic stroke, as shown in clinical studies and rodent models. Whereas humans have one functional MBL protein, rodents have two isoforms, MBL-A and MBL-C, whose functions relative to that of human MBL are unknown. To permit the clinical translation of preclinical data, we aimed to define the specific contributions of MBL-A and MBL-C to brain ischemia. We subjected mice with double (MBL−/−) or single (MBL-A−/− or MBL-C−/−) MBL isoform depletion to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAo). MBL−/− mice had fewer neurological deficits and smaller ischemic lesions than WT mice. MBL-A−/− mice had smaller lesions than WT mice and exhibited no significant behavioral defects, whereas MBL-C−/− mice did not differ from WT mice. The induction of Mbl1 and Mbl2 (the MBL-A and MBL-C genes) expression 48 h after tMCAo was similar across genotypes. The time course of Mbl1 and Mbl2 expression in WT ischemic mice showed that Mbl1 activation occurred earlier (24 h) than Mbl2 activation (48 h). The plasma levels of MBL-A and MBL-C in MBL-C−/− and MBL-A−/− mice, respectively, were similar to those in WT mice both at baseline and at 48 h after tMCAo. At 48 h, MBL-A−/− ischemic mice showed higher MBL-C levels in the brain than WT mice. WT and MBL-C−/− ischemic mice had higher LP activity in plasma and, accordingly, higher levels of C3 deposition in the brain than MBL-A−/− and MBL−/− mice. In conclusion, mice with depletion of both MBL isoforms exhibited strong protection from ischemia/reperfusion injury. MBL-A was the main contributor to injury, likely owing to its earlier activation after ischemia and more efficient activation of the complement system than MBL-C.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0225-1"
"cmi","The histone methyltransferase EZH2 primes the early differentiation of follicular helper T cells during acute viral infection","Epigenetic modifications to histones dictate the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into different subsets of effector T helper (TH) cells. The histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has been implicated in the mechanism regulating the differentiation of TH1, TH2 and regulatory T (Treg) cells. However, whether and how EZH2 regulates follicular helper T (TFH) cell differentiation remain unknown. Using a mouse model of acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, we observed abundant EZH2 expression and associated H3K27me3 modifications preferentially in the early committed virus-specific TFH cells compared to those in TH1 cells. Ablation of EZH2 in LCMV-specific CD4+ T cells leads to a selective impairment of early TFH cell fate commitment, but not late TFH differentiation or memory TFH maintenance. Mechanistically, EZH2 specifically stabilizes the chromatin accessibility of a cluster of genes that are important for TFH fate commitment, particularly B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6), and thus directs TFH cell commitment. Therefore, we identified the chromatin-modifying enzyme EZH2 as a novel regulator of early TFH differentiation during acute viral infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0219-z"
"cmi","Coexpression of CD163 and CD141 identifies human circulating IL-10-producing dendritic cells (DC-10)","Tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) are key players in maintaining immunological homeostasis, dampening immune responses, and promoting tolerance. DC-10, a tolerogenic population of human IL-10-producing DCs characterized by the expression of HLA-G and ILT4, play a pivotal role in promoting tolerance via T regulatory type 1 (Tr1) cells. Thus far, the absence of markers that uniquely identify DC-10 has limited in vivo studies. By in vitro gene expression profiling of differentiated human DCs, we identified CD141 and CD163 as surface markers for DC-10. The coexpression of CD141 and CD163 in combination with CD14 and CD16 enables the ex vivo isolation of DC-10 from the peripheral blood. CD14+CD16+CD141+CD163+ cells isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy subjects (ex vivo DC-10) produced spontaneously and upon activation of IL-10 and limited levels of IL-12. Moreover, in vitro stimulation of allogeneic naive CD4+ T cells with ex vivo DC-10 induced the differentiation of alloantigen-specific CD49b+LAG-3+ Tr1 cells. Finally, ex vivo DC-10 and in vitro generated DC-10 exhibited a similar transcriptional profile, which are characterized by an anti-inflammatory and pro-tolerogenic signature. These results provide new insights into the phenotype and molecular signature of DC-10 and highlight the tolerogenic properties of circulating DC-10. These findings open the opportunity to track DC-10 in vivo and to define their role in physiological and pathological settings.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0218-0"
"cmi","Programming of macrophages by UV-irradiated apoptotic cancer cells inhibits cancer progression and lung metastasis","Apoptotic cell clearance by phagocytes is essential in tissue homeostasis. We demonstrated that conditioned medium (CM) from macrophages exposed to apoptotic cancer cells inhibits the TGF[beta]1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Apoptotic 344SQ (ApoSQ) cell-induced PPAR[gamma] activity in macrophages increased the levels of PTEN, which was secreted in exosomes. Exosomal PTEN was taken up by recipient lung cancer cells. ApoSQ-exposed CM from PTEN knockdown cells failed to enhance PTEN in 344SQ cells, restore cellular polarity, or exert anti-EMT and anti-invasive effects. The CM that was deficient in PPAR[gamma] ligands, including 15-HETE, lipoxin A4, and 15d-PGJ2, could not reverse the suppression of PPAR[gamma] activity or the PTEN increase in 344SQ cells and consequently failed to prevent the EMT process. Moreover, a single injection of ApoSQ cells inhibited lung metastasis in syngeneic immunocompetent mice with enhanced PPAR[gamma]/PTEN signaling both in tumor-associated macrophages and in tumor cells. PPAR[gamma] antagonist GW9662 reversed the signaling by PPAR[gamma]/PTEN; the reduction in EMT-activating transcription factors, such as Snai1 and Zeb1; and the antimetastatic effect of the ApoSQ injection. Thus, the injection of apoptotic lung cancer cells may offer a new strategy for the prevention of lung metastasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0209-1"
"cmi","STING palmitoylation as a therapeutic target","Gain-of-function mutations in the STING-encoding gene TMEM173 are central to the pathology of the autoinflammatory disorder STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI). Furthermore, excessive activity of the STING signaling pathway is associated with autoinflammatory diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS). Two independent studies recently identified pharmacological inhibitors of STING. Strikingly, both types of compounds are reactive nitro-containing electrophiles that target STING palmitoylation, a posttranslational modification necessary for STING signaling. As a consequence, the activation of downstream signaling molecules and the induction of type I interferons were inhibited. The compounds were effective at ameliorating inflammation in a mouse model of AGS and in blocking the production of type I interferons in primary fibroblasts from SAVI patients. This mini-review focuses on the roles of palmitoylation in STING activation and signaling and as a pharmaceutical target for drug development.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-019-0205-5"
"cmi","Reproducing indolent B-cell lymphoma transformation with T-cell immunosuppression in LMP1/CD40-expressing mice","Indolent B-cell lymphomas are a group of incurable cancers of the elderly that encompass various entities, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). All indolent lymphomas may evolve towards aggressive transformation with an increased proliferation index and decreased tumor doubling time. This transformation, which is called Richter's syndrome in CLL, is associated with an aggressive clinical course and poor survival. At least in CLL, transformation of an indolent B-cell clone is molecularly different from that of de novo diffuse large B-cell lymphomas.1 Aging is known to be associated with immune decline, with increased inflammation, decreased immune surveillance and increased onset of malignancies among the consequences.2 Progression of indolent B-cell lymphomas is likely to be associated with escape from immune surveillance.3 Therapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis seem to be effective only for CLL with Richter's transformation.4 However, the role of the immune system in this transformation process is poorly understood.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-018-0197-6"
"cmi","Transmembrane domain-mediated Lck association underlies bystander and costimulatory ICOS signaling","The B7-family inducible costimulator (ICOS) activates phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) and augments calcium mobilization triggered by the T-cell receptor (TCR). We surprisingly found that the entire cytoplasmic domain of ICOS is dispensable for its costimulation of calcium mobilization. This costimulatory function relies on the unique transmembrane domain (TMD) of ICOS, which promotes association with the tyrosine kinase Lck. TMD-enabled Lck association is also required for p85 recruitment to ICOS and subsequent PI3K activation, and Lck underlies both the bystander and costimulatory signaling activity of ICOS. TMD-replaced ICOS, even with an intact cytoplasmic domain, fails to support TFH development or GC formation in vivo. When transplanted onto a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), the ICOS TMD enhances interactions between T cells and antigen-presenting target cells. Therefore, by revealing an unexpected function of the ICOS TMD, our study offers a new perspective for the understanding and potential application of costimulation biology.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-018-0183-z"

However, these pores have never truly been visualized to date. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), which is emerging as a powerful tool to analyze the mechanical properties of biomolecules and cells, is actually an excellent imaging platform that allows biological samples to be visualized by probing surface roughness at the level of atomic resolution. Here, membrane pore structures were clearly visualized using AFM. This visualization not only describes the aperture and depth of the pore complexes but also highlights differences among the pores formed by perforin and gasdermins in tumor cell membranes and by complement in immune cell membranes. Additionally, this type of visualization also reveals the dynamic process of pore formation, fusion, and repair.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-018-0165-1"
"cmi","B cell development is critically dependent on NFATc1 activity","B cell development in bone marrow is a precisely regulated complex process. Through successive stages of differentiation, which are regulated by a multitude of signaling pathways and an array of lineage-specific transcription factors, the common lymphoid progenitors ultimately give rise to mature B cells. Similar to early thymocyte development in the thymus, early B cell development in bone marrow is critically dependent on IL-7 signaling. During this IL-7-dependent stage of differentiation, several transcription factors, such as E2A, EBF1, and Pax5, among others, play indispensable roles in B lineage specification and maintenance. Although recent studies have implicated several other transcription factors in B cell development, the role of NFATc1 in early B cell developmental stages is not known. Here, using multiple gene-manipulated mouse models and applying various experimental methods, we show that NFATc1 activity is vital for early B cell differentiation. Lack of NFATc1 activity in pro-B cells suppresses EBF1 expression, impairs immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, and thereby preBCR formation, resulting in defective B cell development. Overall, deficiency in NFATc1 activity arrested the pro-B cell transition to the pre-B cell stage, leading to severe B cell lymphopenia. Our findings suggest that, along with other transcription factors, NFATc1 is a critical component of the signaling mechanism that facilitates early B cell differentiation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-018-0052-9"
"cmi","Post-transcriptional regulator Rbm47 elevates IL-10 production and promotes the immunosuppression of B cells","Regulatory B cells (Bregs) are a functionally defined B cell subset, and IL-10 is crucial for the suppressive functions of Bregs. However, little is known regarding how IL-10 production is regulated in B cells. To explore the mechanisms by which IL-10 is regulated in B cells, we used mRNA microarrays to screen for molecules that are upregulated in IL-10-producing B cells and identified RNA-binding motif protein 47 (Rbm47) as a post-transcriptional regulator. Rbm47 was found to promote IL-10 production in B cells. We found that Rbm47 promotes the stability of IL-10 mRNA by binding to AU-rich elements in the 3' untranslated region of Il10 mRNA. In addition, we demonstrated that the overexpression of Rbm47 enabled B cells to facilitate Foxp3+ regulator T-cell induction and reduce the severity of DSS-induced ulcerative colitis. Taken together, these results suggest that Rbm47 plays an important role in regulating IL-10 at the post-transcriptional level, thus promoting the regulatory functions of B cells. The findings presented in this study not only increase our understanding of the post-translational regulation of IL-10 in B cells but also identify a novel strategy for the potential application of Bregs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-018-0041-z"
"cmi","The microbiome and autoimmunity: a paradigm from the gut-liver axis","Microbial cells significantly outnumber human cells in the body, and the microbial flora at mucosal sites are shaped by environmental factors and, less intuitively, act on host immune responses, as demonstrated by experimental data in germ-free and gnotobiotic studies. Our understanding of this link stems from the established connection between infectious bacteria and immune tolerance breakdown, as observed in rheumatic fever triggered by Streptococci via molecular mimicry, epitope spread and bystander effects. The availability of high-throughput techniques has significantly advanced our capacity to sequence the microbiome and demonstrated variable degrees of dysbiosis in numerous autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and autoimmune liver disease. It remains unknown whether the observed differences are related to the disease pathogenesis or follow the therapeutic and inflammatory changes and are thus mere epiphenomena. In fact, there are only limited data on the molecular mechanisms linking the microbiota to autoimmunity, and microbial therapeutics is being investigated to prevent or halt autoimmune diseases. As a putative mechanism, it is of particular interest that the apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells in response to microbial stimuli enables the presentation of self-antigens, giving rise to the differentiation of autoreactive Th17 cells and other T helper cells. This comprehensive review will illustrate the data demonstrating the crosstalk between intestinal microbiome and host innate and adaptive immunity, with an emphasis on how dysbiosis may influence systemic autoimmunity. In particular, a gut-liver axis involving the intestinal microbiome and hepatic autoimmunity is elucidated as a paradigm, considering its anatomic and physiological connections.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi20187"
"cmi","Low-dose decitabine enhances the effect of PD-1 blockade in colorectal cancer with microsatellite stability by re-modulating the tumor microenvironment","PD-1 blockade has demonstrated impressive clinical outcomes in colorectal cancers that have high microsatellite instability. However, the therapeutic efficacy for patients with tumors with low microsatellite instability or stable microsatellites needs further improvement. Here, we have demonstrated that low-dose decitabine could increase the expression of immune-related genes such as major histocompatibility complex genes and cytokine-related genes as well as the number of lymphocytes at the tumor site in CT26 colorectal cancer-bearing mice. A more significant inhibition of tumor growth and a prolongation of survival were observed in the CT26 mouse model after treatment with a combination of PD-1 blockade and decitabine than in mice treated with decitabine or PD-1 blockade alone. The anti-tumor effect of the PD-1 blockade was enhanced by low-dose decitabine. The results of RNA sequencing and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of decitabine-treated CT26 cells and tumor samples with microsatellite stability from the patient tumor-derived xenograft model have shown that many immune-related genes, including antigen-processing and antigen-presenting genes, were upregulated, whereas the promoter demethylation was downregulated after decitabine exposure. Therefore, decitabine-based tumor microenvironment re-modulation could improve the effect of the PD-1 blockade. The application of decitabine in PD-1 blockade-based immunotherapy may elicit more potent immune responses, which can provide clinical benefits to the colorectal cancer patients with low microsatellite instability or stable microsatellites.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-018-0026-y"
"cmi","Trophoblast-derived CXCL16 induces M2 macrophage polarization that in turn inactivates NK cells at the maternal-fetal interface","Decidual macrophages (dMΦ) are distinct from the conventional macrophages present in other tissues and express M2 macrophage markers, but the molecular mechanisms of formation and the roles of M2 MΦ during pregnancy have not been completely elucidated. The crosstalk between decidual natural killer cells (dNK) and dMΦ plays an important role in the maintenance of maternal-fetal immune tolerance. Here, CXCL16 derived from first-trimester trophoblast cells induces the polarization of human M2 macrophages. The M2 MΦ polarized by CXCL16 exhibit decreased interleukin-15 production, which facilitates the inactivation of NK cells. The cytotoxicity of NK cells is attenuated by the CXCL16-polarized M2 MΦ. The data shown in the present study provide evidence to support the hypothesis that CXCL16 secreted by trophoblast cells is a key molecule involved in decidual M2 MΦ polarization, which in turn regulates the killing ability of NK cells, thereby contributing to the homeostatic and immune-tolerant milieu required for successful fetal development.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-018-0019-x"

Autophagy is an important degradation pathway that buffers nutrient deprivation by recycling macromolecules in organisms from yeast to man. Perturbations in autophagy are associated with inflammation and cancer development. Emerging studies have characterized the molecular details regarding how autophagy is controlled by immune cells. Among these, dendritic cells (DCs) are one of the most potent professional antigen-presenting cells critical for the activation of naïve T cells to maintain immune tolerance and drive protective immunity to infection and cancer. DCs undergo functional maturation that can either lead to an immunostimulatory phenotype, as in the context of infection, or to a tolerogenic phenotype associated with immunosuppression to self-antigens, as well as to cancer. An increasing number of recent studies has characterized the involvement of autophagy in DC functions in various physiological and pathological contexts. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of these outcomes and discuss the limitation of the models used and the forefront of the knowledge concerning the crosstalk between autophagy and DC biology.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi20182"

Previous studies have shown that CD147 participates in T-cell activation. However, it remains unclear whether CD147 is involved in abnormal Tm-cell activation in RA patients. In this study, we demonstrated that CD147 was predominantly upregulated in Tm cells derived from RA patients. The anti-CD147 mAb 5A12 specifically inhibited Tm-cell activation and proliferation and further restrained osteoclastogenesis. Using a structural-functional approach, we depicted the interface between 5A12 and CD147. This allowed us to identify two critical residues, Lys63 and Asp65, as potential targets for RA treatment, as the double mutation K63A/D65A inhibited Tm-cell activation, mimicking the neutralization by 5A12. This study provides not only a theoretical basis for a “CD147-Tm/Osteoclast-RA chain” for the potential prevention and treatment of RA or other T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases but also a new target for related drug design and development.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-018-0012-4"
"cmi","TLR-mediated metabolic reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment: potential novel strategies for cancer immunotherapy","Cellular energy metabolism not only promotes tumor cell growth and metastasis but also directs immune cell survival, proliferation and the ability to perform specific and functional immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. A better understanding of the molecular regulation of metabolism in different cell components in the tumor-suppressive microenvironment is critical for the development of effective strategies for human cancer treatments. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have recently been recognized as critical factors involved in tumor pathogenesis, regulating both tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating innate and adaptive immune cells. However, little is known about the molecular crosstalk between TLR signaling and tumor or/and immune cell metabolism, although there is abundant expression of TLRs in these cells. In this review, we explore the functional role of TLR signaling in reprogramming cell metabolism in the tumor microenvironment. In particular, we discuss how malignant tumors regulate metabolism to support their growth and survival, summarize more recently identified metabolic profiles of different immune cell subsets and TLR-mediated regulation of cellular metabolism in both tumor and immune cells, and further explore potential strategies targeting cell metabolism for TLR-based cancer therapy. An improved understanding of these issues should open new avenues for the development of novel strategies via TLR-mediated metabolic reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment for cancer immunotherapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi20184"
"cmi","Interferon-[beta] induced in female genital epithelium by HIV-1 glycoprotein 120 via Toll-like-receptor 2 pathway acts to protect the mucosal barrier","More than 40% of HIV infections occur via female reproductive tract (FRT) through heterosexual transmission. Epithelial cells that line the female genital mucosa are the first line of defense against HIV-1 and other sexually transmitted pathogens. These sentient cells recognize and respond to external stimuli by induction of a range of carefully balanced innate immune responses. Previously, we have shown that in response to HIV-1 gp120, the genital epithelial cells (GECs) from upper reproductive tract induce an inflammatory response that may facilitate HIV-1 translocation and infection. In this study, we report that the endometrial and endocervical GECs simultaneously induce biologically active interferon-[beta] (IFN[beta]) antiviral responses following exposure to HIV-1 that act to protect the epithelial tight junction barrier. The innate antiviral response was directly induced by HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 and addition of gp120 neutralizing antibody inhibited IFN[beta] production. Interferon-[beta] was induced by gp120 in upper GECs through Toll-like receptor 2 signaling and required presence of heparan sulfate on epithelial cell surface. The induction of IFN[beta] was dependent upon activation of transcription factor IRF3 (interferon regulatory factor 3). The IFN[beta] was biologically active, had a protective effect on epithelial tight junction barrier and was able to inhibit HIV-1 infection in TZM-bl indicator cells and HIV-1 replication in T cells. This is the first report that recognition of HIV-1 by upper GECs leads to induction of innate antiviral pathways. This could explain the overall low infectivity of HIV-1 in the FRT and could be exploited for HIV-1 prophylaxis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2017168"
"cmi","Type III interferon-induced CBF[beta] inhibits HBV replication by hijacking HBx","Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its associated chronic infection remain serious health threats worldwide. However, there is still no impactful approach for clinical treatment of hepatitis B patients. Therefore, developing a better understanding of the interactions between HBV and its host is particularly important. HBV infection has been reported to induce type-III but not type-I or type-II interferon (IFN). In this study, we identified CBF[beta], an HIV enhancer, as an HBV restriction factor that is specifically induced by type-III IFN in the early stages of HBV infection. Type-III IFN-induced IL-10 played an important role in the production of CBF[beta]. Interestingly, the interaction between CBF[beta]- and HBV-encoded regulatory protein X (HBx) enhanced the stability of CBF[beta], but notably blocked HBx-mediated promotion of HBV replication. CBF[beta] expression was lower in HBV patients than in healthy persons, and the addition of serum from HBV patients inhibited CBF[beta] expression in HepG2 cells. On the contrary, HBV via HBsAg inhibited type-III IFN-induced CBF[beta] expression and decreased the anti-HBV activity of type-III IFN, suggesting that HBV inhibits antiviral interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression and induces IFN resistance. Collectively, our results demonstrate that type-III IFN-triggered and IL-10-induced CBF[beta] are crucial factors for inhibiting HBV replication, and the HBx-CBF[beta]-HBsAg axis reveals a new molecular mechanism of interaction between HBV and its hosts.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41423-018-0006-2"

However, no specific Siglec (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin) genes (Siglecs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of SLE. Here, we performed in silico analysis of the function of three major protective alleles in the locus and found that these alleles were expression quantitative trait loci that enhanced expression of the adjacent SIGLEC12 gene. These data suggest that SIGLEC12 may protect against the development of SLE in Asian populations. Consistent with human genetic data, we identified two missense mutations in lupus-prone B6.NZM
Sle1/Sle2/Sle3 (Sle1-3) mice in Siglece, which is the murine Siglec with the greatest homology to human SIGLEC12. Since the mutations resulted in reduced binding of Siglec E to splenic cells, we evaluated whether Siglece

"cmi","Application of light sheet microscopy for qualitative and quantitative analysis of bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue in mice","Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) develops at unpredictable locations around lung bronchi following pulmonary inflammation. The formation and composition of BALT have primarily been investigated by immunohistology that, due to the size of the invested organ, is usually restricted to a limited number of histological sections. To assess the entire BALT of the lung, other approaches are urgently needed. Here, we introduce a novel light sheet microscopy-based approach for assessing lymphoid tissue in the lung. Using antibody staining of whole lung lobes and optical clearing by organic solvents, we present a method that allows in-depth visualization of the entire bronchial tree, the lymphatic vasculature and the immune cell composition of the induced BALT. Furthermore, three-dimensional analysis of the entire lung allows the qualitative and quantitative enumeration of the induced BALT. Using this approach, we show that a single intranasal application of the replication-deficient poxvirus MVA induces BALT that constitutes up to 8% of the entire lung volume in mice deficient in CCR7, in contrast to wild type mice (WT). Furthermore, BALT induced by heat-inactivated E. coli is dominated by a pronounced T cell infiltration in Cxcr5-deficient mice, in contrast to WT mice.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2017150"

In the peripheral lymphoid system, mature B cells are activated by self or/and foreign antigens and signals from helper T cells for differentiating into either memory B cells or antibody-producing plasma cells. Accumulating evidence has shown that epigenetic regulations modulate somatic hypermutation and class switch DNA recombination during B-cell activation and differentiation. Any abnormalities in these complex regulatory processes may contribute to aberrant antibody production, resulting in autoimmune pathogenesis such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Newly generated knowledge from advanced modern technologies such as next-generation sequencing, single-cell sequencing and DNA methylation sequencing has enabled us to better understand B-cell biology and its role in autoimmune development. Thus this review aims to summarize current research progress in epigenetic modifications contributing to B-cell activation and differentiation, especially under autoimmune conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2017133"
"cmi","The IL-1R/TLR signaling pathway is essential for efficient CD8+ T-cell responses against hepatitis B virus in the hydrodynamic injection mouse model","The outcome of hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection is determined by the complex interactions between replicating HBV and the immune system. While the role of the adaptive immune system in the resolution of HBV infection has been studied extensively, the contribution of innate immune mechanisms remains to be defined. Here we examined the role of the interleukin-1 receptor/Toll-like receptor (IL-1R/TLR) signaling pathway in adaptive immune responses and viral clearance by exploring the HBV mouse model. Hydrodynamic injection with a replication-competent HBV genome was performed in wild-type mice (WT) and a panel of mouse strains lacking specific innate immunity component expression. We found higher levels of HBV protein production and replication in Tlr2−/−, Tlr23479−/−, 3d/Tlr24−/−, Myd88/Trif−/− and Irak4−/− mice, which was associated with reduced HBV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in these mice. Importantly, HBV clearance was delayed for more than 2 weeks in 3d/Tlr24−/−, Myd88/Trif−/− and Irak4−/− mice compared to WT mice. HBV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses were functionally impaired for producing the cytokines IFN-[gamma], TNF-[alpha] and IL-2 in TLR signaling-deficient mice compared to WT mice. In conclusion, the IL-1R/TLR signaling pathway might contribute to controlling HBV infection by augmenting HBV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201743"
"cmi","B cell regulation in cancer and anti-tumor immunity","The balance between immune effector cells and immunosuppressive cells and how this regulates the tumor microenvironment has been well described. A significant contribution of immune regulatory cells, including regulatory T cells, to tumor progression has been widely reported. An emerging body of evidence has recently recognized a role for B cells in modulating the immune response to tumors and lymphoid malignancies. Regulatory B cells (Bregs) are a newly designated subset of B cells that have been shown to play a pivotal role in regulating immune responses involved in inflammation, autoimmunity and, more recently, cancer. Bregs can suppress diverse cell subtypes, including T cells, through the secretion of anti-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-10, and can facilitate the conversion of T cells to regulatory T cells, thus attenuating anti-tumor immune responses. Similar B-cell subpopulations have been reported to be recruited to the tumor but to acquire their immunosuppressive properties within the tumor bed and thereby attenuate anti-tumor immune responses. However, despite a pivotal role for Bregs in promoting inflammation and carcinogenesis, the phenotypic diversity of the cell surface markers that are unique to Bregs remains unclear in mice and humans. In this review, we summarize the characteristics of Bregs and review our current knowledge of Bregs and their inhibition of anti-tumor immune responses in murine tumor models and cancer patients.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201735"
"cmi","CD4+ T cells memorize obesity and promote weight regain","Body weight regain often causes failure of obesity therapies while the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that immune cells, especially CD4+ T cells, mediate the 'memory' of previous obese status. In a weight gain-loss-regain model, we found that C57BL/6J mice with an obesity history showed a much faster rate of body weight regain. This obesity memory could last for at least 2 months after previously obese mice were kept at the same body weight as non-obese mice. Surprisingly, such obesity memory was abrogated by dexamethasone treatment, whereas immunodeficient Rag1−/− and H2A−/− mice failed to establish such memory. Rag1−/− mice repossessed the obesity memory when immune cells or CD4+ T cells isolated from previously obese mice were transferred. Furthermore, depletion of CD4+ T cells led to obesity memory ablation. Taken together, we conclude that CD4+ T cells mediate obesity memory and promote weight regain.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201736"
"cmi","Glucocorticoid receptor promotes the function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells by suppressing HIF1[alpha]-dependent glycolysis","Immunomodulatory signaling imposes tight regulations on metabolic programs within immune cells and consequentially determines immune response outcomes. Although the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) has been recently implicated in regulating the function of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), whether the dysregulation of GR in MDSCs is involved in immune-mediated hepatic diseases and how GR regulates the function of MDSCs in such a context remains unknown. Here, we revealed the dysregulation of GR expression in MDSCs during innate immunological hepatic injury (IMH) and found that GR regulates the function of MDSCs through modulating HIF1[alpha]-dependent glycolysis. Pharmacological modulation of GR by its agonist (dexamethasone, Dex) protects IMH mice against inflammatory injury. Mechanistically, GR signaling suppresses HIF1[alpha] and HIF1[alpha]-dependent glycolysis in MDSCs and thus promotes the immune suppressive activity of MDSCs. Our studies reveal a role of GR-HIF1[alpha] in regulating the metabolism and function of MDSCs and further implicate MDSC GR signaling as a potential therapeutic target in hepatic diseases that are driven by innate immune cell-mediated systemic inflammation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi20175"
"cmi","Loss of T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase in the intestinal epithelium promotes local inflammation by increasing colonic stem cell proliferation","T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TC-PTP) has a critical role in the development of the immune system and has been identified as a negative regulator of inflammation. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the TC-PTP locus have been associated with increased susceptibility to inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) in patients. To further understand how TC-PTP is related to IBDs, we investigated the role of TC-PTP in maintaining the intestinal epithelial barrier using an in vivo genetic approach. Intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of TC-PTP was achieved in a mouse model at steady state and in the context of dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Knockout (KO) of TC-PTP in IECs did not result in an altered intestinal barrier. However, upon DSS treatment, IEC-specific TC-PTP KO mice displayed a more severe colitis phenotype with a corresponding increase in the immune response and inflammatory cytokine profile. The absence of TC-PTP caused an altered turnover of IECs, which is further explained by the role of the tyrosine phosphatase in colonic stem cell (CoSC) proliferation. Our results suggest a novel role for TC-PTP in regulating the homeostasis of CoSC proliferation. This supports the protective function of TC-PTP against IBDs, independently of its previously demonstrated role in intestinal immunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201672"
"cmi","IL-25 stimulates M2 macrophage polarization and thereby promotes mitochondrial respiratory capacity and lipolysis in adipose tissues against obesity","Obesity and associated metabolic diseases are characterized by a chronic low-grade inflammatory state with the infiltration of many inflammatory cells, especially macrophages. Immune molecules, including some cytokines, have a close relationship with metabolism. Interleukin (IL)-25 is a member of the IL-17 cytokine family that can regulate macrophages and alleviate some metabolic dysfunction; however, its role and mechanisms in lipid metabolism remain to be extensively clarified. Human serum and liver biopsy specimens, high-fat diet-induced obesity mice and DB/DB (Lepr−/−) animal models were used to examine IL-25 expression in obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). To observe the role of IL-25 in lipid metabolism, model mice were administered with IL-25 or adoptively transferred with IL-25-educated macrophages in vivo, whereas bone marrow-derived macrophages, the macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and adipocytes differentiated from 3T3-L1 were used in vitro. IL-25 was decreased in NAFLD patients and obese mice. In addition, IL-25 reduced body weight gain and lipid accumulation, enhanced lipid uptake by macrophages and increased the expression of lipolysis and [beta]-oxidation enzymes via alternatively activating macrophages. IL-25 also promoted lipolysis and suppressed lipogenesis in adipocytes co-cultured with the IL-25-educated macrophages. Furthermore, IL-25 improved the mitochondrial respiratory capacity and oxygen consumption rate of macrophages and produced more NAD+/NADH and ATP. In conclusion, IL-25 can stimulate M2 macrophage polarization and thereby promote lipolysis and mitochondrial respiratory capacity, highlighting the potential for IL-25 to be used as a therapeutic agent against obesity and associated metabolic syndromes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201671"
"cmi","CD24 aggravates acute liver injury in autoimmune hepatitis by promoting IFN-[gamma] production by CD4+ T cells","The T-cell-mediated immune response is implicated in many clinical hepatic injuries, such as autoimmune hepatitis and acute virus hepatitis. CD24 is widely expressed by different immune cells and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many autoimmune diseases. However, the role of CD24 in T-cell-mediated liver injury has not been elucidated until now. Here we showed that CD24 deficiency protects mice from concanavalin A (ConA)-induced fulminant liver injury by reducing serum interferon-[gamma] (IFN-[gamma]) levels. CD24 expression by hepatic T cells was markedly increased following ConA challenge. Moreover, decreased IFN-[gamma] production by hepatic CD4+ T cells in CD24-deficient mice was detected, which was correlated with downregulated phosphorylation of STAT1 in hepatic tissue. In vitro experiments also supported the conclusion that CD24 deficiency impaired IFN-[gamma] production by CD4+ T cells following ConA, CD3/CD28 and phorbol myristate acetate/ionomycin stimulation. Our study suggests that CD24 deficiency confers hepatoprotection by decreasing CD4+ T-cell-dependent IFN-[gamma] production in vivo, which suggests that CD24 might be a potential target molecule for reducing clinical hepatitis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201657"

[gamma][delta]T cells perform potent immunosurveillance by exerting direct cytotoxicity, strong cytokine production and indirect antitumor immune responses. However, certain [gamma][delta]T-cell subsets also contribute to tumor progression by facilitating cancer-related inflammation and immunosuppression. Here, we review recent observations regarding the antitumor and protumor roles of major structural and functional subsets of human [gamma][delta]T cells, describing how these subsets are activated and polarized, and how these events relate to subsequent function in tumor immunity.

"cmi","Immunosuppression for in vivo research: state-of-the-art protocols and experimental approaches","Almost every experimental treatment strategy using non-autologous cell, tissue or organ transplantation is tested in small and large animal models before clinical translation. Because these strategies require immunosuppression in most cases, immunosuppressive protocols are a key element in transplantation experiments. However, standard immunosuppressive protocols are often applied without detailed knowledge regarding their efficacy within the particular experimental setting and in the chosen model species. Optimization of such protocols is pertinent to the translation of experimental results to human patients and thus warrants further investigation. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding immunosuppressive drug classes as well as their dosages and application regimens with consideration of species-specific drug metabolization and side effects. It also summarizes contemporary knowledge of novel immunomodulatory strategies, such as the use of mesenchymal stem cells or antibodies. Thus, this review is intended to serve as a state-of-the-art compendium for researchers to refine applied experimental immunosuppression and immunomodulation strategies to enhance the predictive value of preclinical transplantation studies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201639"
"cmi","HMGB1, IL-1[alpha], IL-33 and S100 proteins: dual-function alarmins","Our immune system is based on the close collaboration of the innate and adaptive immune systems for the rapid detection of any threats to the host. Recognition of pathogen-derived molecules is entrusted to specific germline-encoded signaling receptors. The same receptors have now also emerged as efficient detectors of misplaced or altered self-molecules that signal tissue damage and cell death following, for example, disruption of the blood supply and subsequent hypoxia. Many types of endogenous molecules have been shown to provoke such sterile inflammatory states when released from dying cells. However, a group of proteins referred to as alarmins have both intracellular and extracellular functions which have been the subject of intense research. Indeed, alarmins can either exert beneficial cell housekeeping functions, leading to tissue repair, or provoke deleterious uncontrolled inflammation. This group of proteins includes the high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), interleukin (IL)-1[alpha], IL-33 and the Ca2+-binding S100 proteins. These dual-function proteins share conserved regulatory mechanisms, such as secretory routes, post-translational modifications and enzymatic processing, that govern their extracellular functions in time and space. Release of alarmins from mesenchymal cells is a highly relevant mechanism by which immune cells can be alerted of tissue damage, and alarmins play a key role in the development of acute or chronic inflammatory diseases and in cancer development.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201634"
"cmi","CD4 and CD8 T cells mediate distinct lethal meningoencephalitis in mice challenged with Tacaribe arenavirus","Neonates are at increased risk of viral encephalopathies that can result in neurological dysfunction, seizures, permanent disability and even death. The neurological damage results from the combined effect of the virus and the immune response it elicits, thus finding tools to facilitate viral clearance from central nervous system (CNS) while minimizing neuron damage remains a critical challenge. Neonatal mice inoculated intraperitoneally with Tacaribe virus (TCRV) develop seizures, hindlimb paralysis and death within 15 days of inoculation. TCRV localizes to the CNS within days of challenge, primarily infecting astrocytes in the cerebellum and brain stem. We show that infection leads to inflammation, T cell and monocyte infiltration into the cerebellar parenchyma, apoptosis of astrocytes, neuronal degeneration and loss of Purkinje cells. Infiltrating antigen-specific T cells fail to clear the virus but drive the disease, as T-cell-deficient CD3ɛ KO mice survive TCRV infection with minimal inflammation or clinical manifestations despite no difference in CNS viral loads in comparison with T-cell sufficient mice. CD8+ T cells drive the pathology, which even in the absence of CD4+ T-cell help, infiltrate the parenchyma and mediate the apoptotic loss of cerebellar astrocytes, neurodegeneration and loss of Purkinje cells resulting in loss of balance, paralysis and death. CD4+ T cells are also pathogenic inducing gliosis and inflammation in the cerebellum and cerebrum that are associated with wasting and death several weeks after CD4+ T-cell transfer. These data demonstrate distinct pathogenic effects of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and identify them as possible therapeutic targets.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201641"
"cmi","Outrunning the Red Queen: bystander activation as a means of outpacing innate immune subversion by intracellular pathogens","Originally described by the late evolutionary biologist Leigh Van Valen, the Red Queen hypothesis posits that the evolutionary arms race between hosts and their pathogens selects for discrete, genetically encoded events that lead to competitive advantages over the other species. Examples of immune evasion strategies are seen throughout the co-evolution of the mammalian immune system and pathogens, such as the enzymatic inactivation of nuclear factor-[kappa]B signaling or host translation by pathogen-encoded virulence factors. Such immunoevasive maneuvers would be expected to select for the evolution of innate immune counterstrategies. Recent advances in our understanding of host immunity and microbial pathogenesis have provided insight into a particular innate immune adaptation, termed bystander activation. Bystander activation occurs as a consequence of infected cells alerting and instructing neighboring uninfected cells to produce inflammatory mediators, either through direct cell contact or paracrine signals. Thus, bystander activation can allow the immune system to overcome the ability of pathogens to disarm immune signaling in directly infected cells. This review presents an overview of the general hallmarks of bystander activation and their emerging role in innate immunity to intracellular pathogens, as well as examples of recent mechanistic discoveries relating to the bystander activation during infection with specific pathogens relevant to human health and disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201636"
"cmi","The AIM2 inflammasome is a central regulator of intestinal homeostasis through the IL-18/IL-22/STAT3 pathway","Inflammasomes are important for maintaining intestinal homeostasis, and dysbiosis contributes to the pathology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and increases the risk for colorectal cancer. Inflammasome defects contribute to chronic intestinal inflammation and increase the susceptibility to colitis in mice. However, the inflammasome sensor absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) protects against colorectal cancer in an inflammasome-independent manner through DNA-dependent protein kinase and Akt pathways. Yet, the roles of the AIM2 inflammasome in IBD and the early phases of colorectal cancer remain ill-defined. Here we show that the AIM2 inflammasome has a protective role in the intestine. During steady state, Aim2 deletion results in the loss of IL-18 secretion, suppression of the IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP) in intestinal epithelial cells and consequent loss of the STAT3-dependent antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) Reg3[beta] and Reg3[gamma], which promotes dysbiosis-linked colitis. During dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis, a dysfunctional IL-18/IL-22BP pathway in Aim2−/− mice promotes excessive IL-22 production and elevated STAT3 activation. Aim2−/− mice further exhibit sustained STAT3 and Akt activation during the resolution of colitis fueled by enhanced Reg3b and Reg3g expression. This self-perpetuating mechanism promotes proliferation of intestinal crypt cells and likely contributes to the recently described increase in susceptibility of Aim2−/− mice to colorectal cancer. Collectively, our results demonstrate a central role for the AIM2 inflammasome in preventing dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation through regulation of the IL-18/IL-22BP/IL-22 and STAT3 pathway and expression of select AMPs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201635"
"cmi","Human CD39hi regulatory T cells present stronger stability and function under inflammatory conditions","Autoimmune diseases are characterized by an imbalance between regulatory T cells and effector T-cell subsets, such as Th1 and Th17 cells. Studies have confirmed that natural CD4+Foxp3+ Tregs were unstable and dysfunctional in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In the current study, human CD39hi Tregs and CD39low Tregs were sorted from Tregs in vitro after 7 days of expansion. The functions of both Treg subsets were investigated under inflammatory conditions in vitro and in vivo. In the presence of IL-1[beta] and IL-6, cultured CD4+CD39hi Tregs maintained stable forkhead box protein 3 expression, whereas CD4+CD39low Tregs lost Foxp3 expression and trans-differentiated into Th1 or Th17 cells. Decreased IL-1[beta]R and IL-6R expression on the CD39hi Tregs was the primary mechanism responsible for Treg stability. In addition, reduced activation of downstream molecules, such as STAT1 and STAT3, through the modulation of CpG demethylation played an important role. Finally, human CD4+CD39hi Tregs but not CD4+CD39low Tregs protected against xenograft versus host disease in model mice. These results strongly implied the physiological importance of CD39 expression and suggested that manipulation of CD39hi Tregs might represent a novel strategy for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201630"
"cmi","Sam68 is a regulator of Toll-like receptor signaling","Recognition of pathogens by Toll-like receptors (TLR) activate multiple signaling cascades and expression of genes tailored to mount a primary immune response, inflammation, cell survival and apoptosis. Although TLR-induced activation of pathways, such as nuclear factor kappaB (NF-[kappa]B) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), has been well studied, molecular entities controlling quantitative regulation of these pathways during an immune response remain poorly defined. We identified Sam68 as a novel regulator of TLR-induced NF-[kappa]B and MAPK activation. We found that TLR2 and TLR3 are totally dependent, whereas TLR4 is only partially dependent on Sam68 to induce the activation of NF-[kappa]B c-Rel. Absence of Sam68 greatly decreased TLR2- and TLR3-induced NF-[kappa]B p65 activation, whereas TLR4-induced p65 activation in a Sam68-independent manner. In contrast, Sam68 appeared to be a negative regulator of MAPK pathways because absence of Sam68 enhanced TLR2-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK). Interestingly, TLR2- and TLR3-induced gene expression showed a differential requirement of Sam68. Absence of Sam68 impaired TLR2-induced gene expression, suggesting that Sam68 has a critical role in myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88-dependent TLR2 signaling. TLR3-induced gene expression that utilize Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor-domain-containing adapter-inducing beta interferon pathway, depend only partially on Sam68. Our findings suggest that Sam68 may function as an immune rheostat that balances the activation of NF-[kappa]B p65 and c-Rel, as well as MAPK, revealing a potential novel target to manipulate TLR signaling.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201632"
"cmi","Post-translational regulation of inflammasomes","Inflammasomes play essential roles in immune protection against microbial infections. However, excessive inflammation is implicated in various human diseases, including autoinflammatory syndromes, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, precise regulation of inflammasome activities is critical for adequate immune protection while limiting collateral tissue damage. In this review, we focus on the emerging roles of post-translational modifications (PTMs) that regulate activation of the NLRP3, NLRP1, NLRC4, AIM2 and IFI16 inflammasomes. We anticipate that these types of PTMs will be identified in other types of and less well-characterized inflammasomes. Because these highly diverse and versatile PTMs shape distinct inflammatory responses in response to infections and tissue damage, targeting the enzymes involved in these PTMs will undoubtedly offer opportunities for precise modulation of inflammasome activities under various pathophysiological conditions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201629"
"cmi","Liver-infiltrating CD11b−CD27− NK subsets account for NK-cell dysfunction in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and are associated with tumor progression","Natural killer (NK) cells have a vital role in killing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells; however, the mechanism underlying tumor-infiltrating NK (TINK)-cell dysfunction remains poorly understood. Using flow cytometry staining, we precisely characterized the frequency, phenotype and function of NK subsets distinguished by CD27 and CD11b in 30 patients with HCC in comparison to 30 healthy controls. Interestingly, we found a substantial proportion of liver-infiltrating CD11b−CD27− (DN) NK subsets in tumor tissue from HCC patients. Remarkably, these relatively expanded DN NK subsets exhibited an inactive and immature phenotype. By detecting the expression of CD107a and interferon-gamma (IFN-[gamma]) on NK subsets and NK cells, we demonstrated that DN NK subsets exhibited a poor cytotoxic capacity and deficient potential to produce IFN-[gamma] in comparison to the other three subsets, which contributed to the dysfunction of TINK cells in HCC patients. In addition, we found that the presence of DN NK cells was closely associated with the clinical outcomes of HCC patients, as the frequency of DN NK cells among TINK cells was positively correlated with tumor stage and size. A large percentage of DN NK cells among TINK cells was an independent prognostic factor for lower survival in the 60-month follow-up period. In conclusion, a substantial proportion of CD11b−CD27−NK subsets among TINK cells accounts for NK-cell dysfunction in patients with HCC and is associated with tumor progression. Our study may provide a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of patients with HCC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201628"

Over the past several years, growing evidence has highlighted the important roles of nonclassical MHC-I and non-MHC-I molecules in NK cell education. Herein, we review the current knowledge of NK cell education, with a particular focus on nonclassical MHC-I- and non-MHC-I-dependent education, and compare them with the classical MHC-I-dependent education theory. In addition, we update and extend this theory by presenting the 'Confining Model', discussing cis and trans characteristics, reassessing quantity and quality control, and elucidating the redundancy of NK cell education in tumor and virus infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201626"

We have gained a more detailed understanding of the cellular players and molecular mediators of inflammation which is now being applied and extended to areas of biomedical research such as cancer, obesity, heart disease, metabolism, auto-inflammatory disorders, autoimmunity and infectious diseases.

However, their roles in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remain unclear. Here, we report that exosomes present in the sera of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients contained both HBV nucleic acids and HBV proteins, and transferred HBV to hepatocytes in an active manner. Notably, HBV nucleic acids were detected in natural killer (NK) cells from both CHB patients and healthy donors after exposure to HBV-positive exosomes. Through real-time fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3',-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine, 4-chlorobenzenesulfnate salt (DiD)-labeled exosomes were observed to interact with NK cells and to be taken up by NK cells, which was enhanced by transforming growth factor-[beta] treatment. Furthermore, HBV-positive exosomes impaired NK-cell functions, including interferon (IFN)-[gamma] production, cytolytic activity, NK-cell proliferation and survival, as well as the responsiveness of the cells to poly (I:C) stimulation. HBV infection suppressed the expression of pattern-recognition receptors, especially retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I), on NK cells, resulting in the dampening of the nuclear factor [kappa]B(NF-[kappa]B) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Our results highlight a previously unappreciated role of exosomes in HBV transmission and NK-cell dysfunction during CHB infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201624"
"cmi","Innate recognition of Toxoplasma gondii in humans involves a mechanism distinct from that utilized by rodents","Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite that infects rodents as part of its natural transmission cycle and induces disease in humans, an end-stage host. As one of the natural hosts of T. gondii, the mouse has been used extensively for elucidating the cellular and molecular basis of immunity to this pathogen while relatively few studies have focused on the response of humans. In our recent work, we identified CD16+ monocytes and DC1 dendritic cells as the major myeloid cell populations that respond to T. gondii in human peripheral blood. Interestingly, these myeloid subsets represent the opposite counterparts from those triggered by the parasite in mice. Moreover, whereas the innate cytokine response to T. gondii in the mouse involves stimulation of Toll-like receptors by a soluble parasite ligand, the response of human cells instead requires phagocytosis of the live pathogen. We speculate that these marked distinctions in the pathways utilized for innate recognition of toxoplasma in mouse and man reflect the differing roles of the two hosts in the biology of this parasite.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201612"

However, the role of CD4 T cells in the hemagglutinin stalk-specific immune response is not clear. Here we identified a mouse CD4 T-cell epitope that encompasses residues HA2113-131 from the hemagglutinin stalk domain after a sub-lethal infection of influenza. In response to stimulation with the identified epitope, splenocytes derived from the infected mice showed significant polyfunctionality as shown by IL-2, TNF-[alpha] and IFN-[gamma] production as well as degranulation. Moreover, mice immunized with the peptide corresponding to this CD4 T-cell epitope exhibited interindividual sharing of the CD4 T-cell receptor [beta] sequences, and they had a higher survival rate following a challenge with a lethal dose of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Thus, our data demonstrated a crucial role of hemagglutinin stalk-specific CD4 T cells in the host immune response against influenza virus infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201620"
"cmi","Differences in phenotype, homing properties and suppressive activities of regulatory T cells induced by epicutaneous, oral or sublingual immunotherapy in mice sensitized to peanut","Allergen-specific immunotherapy has been proposed as an attractive strategy to actively treat food allergy using the following three different immunotherapy routes: oral (OIT), sublingual (SLIT) and epicutaneous (EPIT) immunotherapy. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been shown to have a pivotal role in the mechanisms of immunotherapy. The aim of this study was to compare the phenotype and function of Tregs induced in peanut-sensitized BALB/c mice using these three routes of treatment. We show that although EPIT, OIT and SLIT were all able to effectively desensitize peanut-sensitized mice, they induced different subsets of Tregs. Foxp3+ Tregs were induced by the three treatment routes but with greater numbers induced by EPIT. EPIT and OIT also increased the level of LAP+ Tregs, whereas SLIT induced IL-10+ cells. The suppressive activity of EPIT-induced Tregs did not depend on IL-10 but required CTLA-4, whereas OIT acted through both mechanisms and SLIT was strictly dependent on IL-10. Moreover, the three routes influenced the homing properties of induced Tregs differently, with a larger repertoire of chemokine receptors expressed by EPIT-induced Tregs compared with OIT- and SLIT- induced cells, resulting in different protective consequences against allergen exposure. Furthermore, whereas OIT- or SLIT-induced Tregs lost their suppressive activities after treatment was discontinued, the suppressive activities of EPIT-induced Tregs were still effective 8 weeks after the end of treatment, suggesting the induction of a more long-lasting tolerance. In summary, EPIT, OIT and SLIT mediated desensitization through the induction of different subsets of Tregs, leading to important differences in the subsequent protection against allergen exposure and the possible induction of tolerance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201614"
"cmi","Liver immunology and its role in inflammation and homeostasis","The human liver is usually perceived as a non-immunological organ engaged primarily in metabolic, nutrient storage and detoxification activities. However, we now know that the healthy liver is also a site of complex immunological activity mediated by a diverse immune cell repertoire as well as non-hematopoietic cell populations. In the non-diseased liver, metabolic and tissue remodeling functions require elements of inflammation. This inflammation, in combination with regular exposure to dietary and microbial products, creates the potential for excessive immune activation. In this complex microenvironment, the hepatic immune system tolerates harmless molecules while at the same time remaining alert to possible infectious agents, malignant cells or tissue damage. Upon appropriate immune activation to challenge by pathogens or tissue damage, mechanisms to resolve inflammation are essential to maintain liver homeostasis. Failure to clear 'dangerous' stimuli or regulate appropriately activated immune mechanisms leads to pathological inflammation and disrupted tissue homeostasis characterized by the progressive development of fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventual liver failure. Hepatic inflammatory mechanisms therefore have a spectrum of roles in the healthy adult liver; they are essential to maintain tissue and organ homeostasis and, when dysregulated, are key drivers of the liver pathology associated with chronic infection, autoimmunity and malignancy. In this review, we explore the changing perception of inflammation and inflammatory mediators in normal liver homeostasis and propose targeting of liver-specific immune regulation pathways as a therapeutic approach to treat liver disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi20163"
"cmi","Modulation of liver tolerance by conventional and nonconventional antigen-presenting cells and regulatory immune cells","The liver is a tolerogenic organ with exquisite mechanisms of immune regulation that ensure upkeep of local and systemic immune tolerance to self and foreign antigens, but that is also able to mount effective immune responses against pathogens. The immune privilege of liver allografts was recognized first in pigs in spite of major histo-compatibility complex mismatch, and termed the “liver tolerance effect”. Furthermore, liver transplants are spontaneously accepted with only low-dose immunosuppression, and induce tolerance for non-hepatic co-transplanted allografts of the same donor. Although this immunotolerogenic environment is favorable in the setting of organ transplantation, it is detrimental in chronic infectious liver diseases like hepatitis B or C, malaria, schistosomiasis or tumorigenesis, leading to pathogen persistence and weak anti-tumor effects. The liver is a primary site of T-cell activation, but it elicits poor or incomplete activation of T cells, leading to their abortive activation, exhaustion, suppression of their effector function and early death. This is exploited by pathogens and can impair pathogen control and clearance or allow tumor growth. Hepatic priming of T cells is mediated by a number of local conventional and nonconventional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which promote tolerance by immune deviation, induction of T-cell anergy or apoptosis, and generating and expanding regulatory T cells. This review will focus on the communication between classical and nonclassical APCs and lymphocytes in the liver in tolerance induction and will discuss recent insights into the role of innate lymphocytes in this process.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2015112"

In this study, hepatitis B surface antigen transgenic (HBs-Tg) mice and their wild-type (WT) control C57BL/6 mice were injected with CpG-oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) to mimic the translocation of gut microbial products into the systemic circulation. We found that, compared with the WT mice, the HBs-Tg mice were oversensitive to CpG-ODN-induced liver injury, which was dependent on natural killer T (NKT) cells. CpG-ODN injection enhanced the expression of Fas ligand (FasL) on NKT cells. In addition, hepatocytes from the HBs-Tg mice expressed higher levels of Fas than did those from the WT mice, which was further augmented by CpG-ODN. Interaction of Fas and FasL was involved in the cytotoxicity of NKT cells against hepatocytes in the HBs-Tg mice. Moreover, Kupffer cells in the HBs-Tg mice expressed higher levels of CD205 and produced greater amounts of interleukin (IL)-12 than did those in the WT mice. Finally, the depletion of Kupffer cells, neutralization of IL-12 or specific silencing of CD205 on Kupffer cells significantly inhibited CpG-ODN-induced liver injury and NKT activation in the HBs-Tg mice. Our data suggest that CD205-expressing Kupffer cells respond to CpG-ODNs and subsequently release IL-12 to promote NKT cell activation. Activated NKT cells induce liver damage through the Fas signaling pathway in HBs-Tg mice.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2015111"
"cmi","Immunological functions of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells","Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) line the liver sinusoids and separate passenger leukocytes in the sinusoidal lumen from hepatocytes. LSECs further act as a platform for adhesion of various liver-resident immune cell populations such as Kupffer cells, innate lymphoid cells or liver dendritic cells. In addition to having an extraordinary scavenger function, LSECs possess potent immune functions, serving as sentinel cells to detect microbial infection through pattern recognition receptor activation and as antigen (cross)-presenting cells. LSECs cross-prime naive CD8 T cells, causing their rapid differentiation into memory T cells that relocate to secondary lymphoid tissues and provide protection when they re-encounter the antigen during microbial infection. Cross-presentation of viral antigens by LSECs derived from infected hepatocytes triggers local activation of effector CD8 T cells and thereby assures hepatic immune surveillance. The immune function of LSECs complements conventional immune-activating mechanisms to accommodate optimal immune surveillance against infectious microorganisms while preserving the integrity of the liver as a metabolic organ.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi20165"
"cmi","Sterile signals generate weaker and delayed macrophage NLRP3 inflammasome responses relative to microbial signals","Inflammation is the host response to microbial infection or sterile injury that aims to eliminate the insult, repair the tissue and restore homeostasis. Macrophages and the NLRP3 inflammasome are key sentinels for both types of insult. Although it is well established that the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated by microbial products and molecules released during sterile injury, it is unclear whether the responses elicited by these different types of signals are distinct. In this study, we used lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor as prototypical microbial and sterile signal 1 stimuli, respectively, to prime the NLRP3 inflammasome. We then used the bacterial toxin nigericin and a common product released from necrotic cells, ATP, as prototypical microbial and sterile signal 2 stimuli, respectively, to trigger the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex in mouse and human macrophages. We found that NLRP3 inflammasome responses were weakest when both signal 1 and signal 2 were sterile, but responses were faster and stronger when at least one of the two signals was microbial. Ultimately, the most rapid and potent responses were elicited when both signals were microbial. Together, these data suggest that microbial versus sterile signals are distinct, both kinetically and in magnitude, in their ability to generate inflammasome-dependent responses. This hierarchy of NLRP3 responses to sterile versus microbial stimuli likely reflects the urgent need for the immune system to respond rapidly to the presence of infection to halt pathogen dissemination.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201611"
"cmi","Adaptive immunity in the liver","The anatomical architecture of the human liver and the diversity of its immune components endow the liver with its physiological function of immune competence. Adaptive immunity is a major arm of the immune system that is organized in a highly specialized and systematic manner, thus providing long-lasting protection with immunological memory. Adaptive immunity consists of humoral immunity and cellular immunity. Cellular immunity is known to have a crucial role in controlling infection, cancer and autoimmune disorders in the liver. In this article, we will focus on hepatic virus infections, hepatocellular carcinoma and autoimmune disorders as examples to illustrate the current understanding of the contribution of T cells to cellular immunity in these maladies. Cellular immune suppression is primarily responsible for chronic viral infections and cancer. However, an uncontrolled auto-reactive immune response accounts for autoimmunity. Consequently, these immune abnormalities are ascribed to the quantitative and functional changes in adaptive immune cells and their subsets, innate immunocytes, chemokines, cytokines and various surface receptors on immune cells. A greater understanding of the complex orchestration of the hepatic adaptive immune regulators during homeostasis and immune competence are much needed to identify relevant targets for clinical intervention to treat immunological disorders in the liver.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi20164"
"cmi","NKT cell subsets as key participants in liver physiology and pathology","Natural killer T (NKT) cells are innate-like lymphocytes that generally recognize lipid antigens and are enriched in microvascular compartments of the liver. NKT cells can be activated by self- or microbial-lipid antigens and by signaling through toll-like receptors. Following activation, NKT cells rapidly secrete pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and thereby determine the milieu for subsequent immunity or tolerance. It is becoming clear that two different subsets of NKT cells-type I and type II-have different modes of antigen recognition and have opposing roles in inflammatory liver diseases. Here we focus mainly on the roles of both NKT cell subsets in the maintenance of immune tolerance and inflammatory diseases in liver. Furthermore, how the differential activation of type I and type II NKT cells influences other innate cells and adaptive immune cells to result in important consequences for tissue integrity is discussed. It is crucial that better reagents, including CD1d tetramers, be used in clinical studies to define the roles of NKT cells in liver diseases in patients.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2015115"
"cmi","Viral evasion of DNA-stimulated innate immune responses","Cellular sensing of virus-derived nucleic acids is essential for early defenses against virus infections. In recent years, the discovery of DNA sensing proteins, including cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and gamma-interferon-inducible protein (IFI16), has led to understanding of how cells evoke strong innate immune responses against incoming pathogens carrying DNA genomes. The signaling stimulated by DNA sensors depends on the adaptor protein STING (stimulator of interferon genes), to enable expression of antiviral proteins, including type I interferon. To facilitate efficient infections, viruses have evolved a wide range of evasion strategies, targeting host DNA sensors, adaptor proteins and transcription factors. In this review, the current literature on virus-induced activation of the STING pathway is presented and we discuss recently identified viral evasion mechanisms targeting different steps in this antiviral pathway.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi20166"
"cmi","Presentation of hepatocellular antigens","The liver is an organ in which antigen-specific T-cell responses manifest a bias toward immune tolerance. This is clearly seen in the rejection of allogeneic liver transplants, and multiple other phenomena suggest that this effect is more general. These include tolerance toward antigens introduced via the portal vein, immune failure to several hepatotropic viruses, the lack of natural liver-stage immunity to malaria parasites, and the frequent metastasis of cancers to the liver. Here we review the mechanisms by which T cells engage with hepatocellular antigens, the context in which such encounters occur, and the mechanisms that act to suppress a full T-cell response. While many mechanisms play a role, we will argue that two important processes are the constraints on the cross-presentation of hepatocellular antigens, and the induction of negative feedback inhibition driven by interferons. The constant exposure of the liver to microbial products from the intestine may drive innate immunity, rendering the local environment unfavorable for specific T-cell responses through this mechanism. Nevertheless, tolerance toward hepatocellular antigens is not monolithic and under specific circumstances allows both effective immunity and immunopathology.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2015109"
"cmi","Hepatic macrophages in homeostasis and liver diseases: from pathogenesis to novel therapeutic strategies","Macrophages represent a major cell type of innate immunity and have emerged as a critical player and therapeutic target in many chronic inflammatory diseases. Hepatic macrophages consist of Kupffer cells, which are originated from the fetal yolk-sack, and infiltrated bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages. Hepatic macrophages play a central role in maintaining homeostasis of the liver and in the pathogenesis of liver injury, making them an attractive therapeutic target for liver diseases. However, the various populations of hepatic macrophages display different phenotypes and exert distinct functions. Thus, more research is required to better understand these cells to guide the development of macrophage-based therapeutic interventions. This review article will summarize the current knowledge on the origins and composition of hepatic macrophages, their functions in maintaining hepatic homeostasis, and their involvement in both promoting and resolving liver inflammation, injury, and fibrosis. Finally, the current strategies being developed to target hepatic macrophages for the treatment of liver diseases will be reviewed.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2015104"
"cmi","Hepatocytes: a key cell type for innate immunity","Hepatocytes, the major parenchymal cells in the liver, play pivotal roles in metabolism, detoxification, and protein synthesis. Hepatocytes also activate innate immunity against invading microorganisms by secreting innate immunity proteins. These proteins include bactericidal proteins that directly kill bacteria, opsonins that assist in the phagocytosis of foreign bacteria, iron-sequestering proteins that block iron uptake by bacteria, several soluble factors that regulate lipopolysaccharide signaling, and the coagulation factor fibrinogen that activates innate immunity. In this review, we summarize the wide variety of innate immunity proteins produced by hepatocytes and discuss liver-enriched transcription factors (e.g. hepatocyte nuclear factors and CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins), pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g. interleukin (IL)-6, IL-22, IL-1[beta] and tumor necrosis factor-[alpha]), and downstream signaling pathways (e.g. signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 3 and nuclear factor-[kappa]B) that regulate the expression of these innate immunity proteins. We also briefly discuss the dysregulation of these innate immunity proteins in chronic liver disease, which may contribute to an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection in patients with cirrhosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201597"
"cmi","Liver natural killer cells: subsets and roles in liver immunity","The liver represents a frontline immune organ that is constantly exposed to a variety of gut-derived antigens as a result of its unique location and blood supply. With a predominant role in innate immunity, the liver is enriched with various innate immune cells, among which natural killer (NK) cells play important roles in host defense and in maintaining immune balance. Hepatic NK cells were first described as 'pit cells' in the rat liver in the 1970s. Recent studies of NK cells in mouse and human livers have shown that two distinct NK cell subsets, liver-resident NK cells and conventional NK (cNK) cells, are present in this organ. Here, we review liver NK cell subsets in different species, revisiting rat hepatic pit cells and highlighting recent progress related to resident NK cells in mouse and human livers, and also discuss the dual roles of NK cells in liver immunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201596"
"cmi","Carbon monoxide decreases interleukin-1[beta] levels in the lung through the induction of pyrin","Carbon monoxide (CO) can act as an anti-inflammatory effector in mouse models of lung injury and disease, through the downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines production, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-, leucine-rich region-, and pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a protein complex that regulates the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1[beta] (IL-1[beta]). In this report, we show that the CO-releasing molecule (CORM-2) can stimulate the expression of pyrin, a negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome. CORM-2 increased the transcription of pyrin in the human leukemic cell line (THP-1) in the absence and presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In THP-1 cells, CORM-2 treatment dose-dependently reduced the activation of caspase-1 and the secretion of IL-1[beta], and increased the levels of IL-10, in response to LPS and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), an NLRP3 inflammasome activation model. Genetic interference of IL-10 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced the effectiveness of CORM-2 in inhibiting IL-1[beta] production and in inducing pyrin expression. Genetic interference of pyrin by siRNA increased IL-1[beta] production in response to LPS and ATP, and reversed CORM-2-dependent inhibition of caspase-1 activation. CO inhalation (250 ppm) in vivo increased the expression of pyrin and IL-10 in lung and spleen, and decreased the levels of IL-1[beta] induced by LPS. Consistent with the induction of pyrin and IL-10, and the downregulation of lung IL-1[beta] production, CO provided protection in a model of acute lung injury induced by intranasal LPS administration. These results provide a novel mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of CO, involving the IL-10-dependent upregulation of pyrin expression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201579"
"cmi","Effective intrahepatic CD8+ T-cell immune responses are induced by low but not high numbers of antigen-expressing hepatocytes","Liver infections with hepatotropic viruses, such as hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus are accompanied by viral persistence and immune failure. CD8+ T cells are crucial mediators of the intrahepatic antiviral immune response. Chronic infections of the liver and other organs correlate with T-cell exhaustion. It was previously suggested that high antigen load could result in T-cell exhaustion. We aimed at elucidating the impact of different intrahepatic antigen loads on the quality of CD8+ T-cell-mediated immunity by employing an infection-free transgenic mouse model expressing ovalbumin (Ova) as the target antigen. Adoptive transfer of OT-I cells induced a transient intrahepatic immune response toward both high and low Ova levels. However, antigen clearance was achieved only in mice expressing low antigen levels. In contrast, T cells exposed to high antigen levels underwent exhaustion and became depleted, causing antigen persistence. Moreover, when functional T cells were exposed to high intrahepatic antigen levels, a complete transition toward exhaustion was observed. Thus, this study shows that the antigen expression level in the liver correlates inversely with T-cell immunity in vivo and governs the efficiency of immune responses upon antigen presentation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201580"
"cmi","Abrogation of immune complex glomerulonephritis by native carboxypeptidase and pharmacological antagonism of the C5a receptor","Activation of complement generates C5a which leads to signaling through C5aR1. This is tightly controlled, including by the plasma proteins factor H (FH) and carboxypeptidase N. Here we studied a chronic serum sickness (CSS) model of glomerulonephritis (GN) in which there is an active humoral immune response, formation of glomerular immune complexes (ICs), and resulting glomerular inflammation. The antibody response, glomerular IC deposition, the degree of GN, and consequent renal functional insufficiency in CSS were all worse in FH−/− mice compared to wild-type FH+/+ animals. This was ameliorated in the former by giving a C5aR1 antagonist for the final 3 weeks of the 5-week protocol. In contrast, blocking CP-mediated inactivation of C5a increased these disease measures. Thus, complement regulation by both plasma FH and CP to limit the quantity of active C5a is important in conditions where the humoral immune response is directed to a continuously present foreign antigen. Signaling through C5aR1 enhances the humoral immune response as well as the inflammatory response to ICs that have formed in glomeruli. Both effects are relevant even after disease has begun. Thus, pharmacological targeting of C5a in IC-mediated GN has potential clinical relevance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201545"
"cmi","Suppressed expression of miR-378 targeting gzmb in NK cells is required to control dengue virus infection","Dengue virus (DENV) remains a major public health threat because no vaccine or drugs are available for the prevention and treatment of DENV infection, and the immunopathogenesis mechanisms of DENV infection are not fully understood. Cytotoxic molecules, such as granzyme B (GrzB), may be necessary to control viral infections. However, the exact role of GrzB during DENV infection and the mechanisms regulating GrzB expression during DENV infection are not clear. This study found that miR-27a*, miR-30e, and miR-378 were down-regulated in DENV-infected patients, and DENV infection in humans induced a significant up-regulation of GrzB in natural killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells. Further investigation indicated that NK cells, but not CD8+ T cells, were the major sources of GrzB, and miR-378, but not miR-27a* or miR-30e, suppressed GrzB expression in NK cells. Notably, we found that overexpression of miR-378 using a miR-378 agomir in DENV-infected mice inhibited GrzB expression and promoted DENV replication. These results suggest the critical importance of miR-378 in the regulation of GrzB expression and a protective role for GrzB in controlling DENV replication in vivo. Therefore, this study provides a new insight into the immunopathogenesis mechanism of DENV infection and a biological basis for the development of new therapeutic strategies to control DENV infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201552"
"cmi","Analysis of CD8+ Treg cells in patients with ovarian cancer: a possible mechanism for immune impairment","Regulatory T (Treg) cells may participate in mediating a suppressive microenvironment that blunts successful anti-tumor immunotherapy. Recent studies show that CD8+ Treg cells might impede effective immune responses to established tumors. However, there is limited research regarding CD8+ Treg cells in ovarian cancer (OC) patients. Here, we investigated CD8+ Treg cells in OC patients and their in vitro induction. The immunohistochemistry of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes revealed a significant correlation between the intratumoral CD8+ T cells and the forkhead box p3 (Foxp3)+ cells in the intraepithelial and stromal areas of advanced OC tissues. We examined the expression of Treg markers in CD8+ T cells from the peripheral blood and fresh tumor tissues of OC patients using flow cytometry. Our results indicated an increase in the CD8+ Treg cell subsets of OC patients compared with those in patients with benign ovarian tumors and healthy controls, including an increased expression of CD25, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4), and Foxp3 and decreased CD28 expression. To demonstrate whether the tumor microenvironment could convert CD8+ effector T cells into suppressor cells, we used an in vitro transwell culturing system. Compared with the CD8+ T cells cultured alone, the CD8+ Treg cells induced in vitro by coculture with SK-OV-3/A2780 showed increased CTLA-4 and Foxp3 expression and decreased CD28 expression. In addition, the in vitro-induced CD8+ Treg cells inhibited naı¨ve CD4+ T-cell proliferation, which was partially mediated through TGF-[beta]1 and IFN-[gamma]. Our study suggests that CD8+ Treg cells were increased in OC patients and could be induced in vitro, which may be the way that tumors limit antitumor immunity and evade immune surveillance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201557"
"cmi","Neddylation is required for herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1)-induced early phase interferon-beta production","Type I interferons such as interferon-beta (IFN-[beta]) play essential roles in the host innate immune response to herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) infection. The transcription of type I interferon genes is controlled by nuclear factor-[kappa]B (NF-[kappa]B) and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family members including IRF3. NF-[kappa]B activation depends on the phosphorylation of inhibitor of [kappa]B (I[kappa]B), which triggers its ubiqitination and degradation. It has been reported that neddylation inhibition by a pharmacological agent MLN4924 potently suppresses lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokine production with the accumulation of phosphorylated I[kappa]B[alpha]. However, the role of neddylation in type I interferon expression remains unknown. Here, we report that neddylation inhibition with MLN4924 or upon UBA3 deficiency led to accumulation of phosphorylated I[kappa]B[alpha], impaired I[kappa]B[alpha] degradation, and impaired NF-[kappa]B nuclear translocation in the early phase of HSV-1 infection even though phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 were not affected. The blockade of NF-[kappa]B nuclear translocation by neddylation inhibition becomes less efficient at the later time points of HSV-1 infection. Consequently, HSV-1-induced early phase IFN-[beta] production significantly decreased upon MLN4924 treatment and UBA3 deficiency. NF-[kappa]B inhibitor JSH-23 mimicked the effects of neddylation inhibition in the early phase of HSV-1 infection. Moreover, the effects of neddylation inhibition on HSV-1-induced early phase IFN-[beta] production diminished in the presence of NF-[kappa]B inhibitor JSH-23. Thus, neddylation contributes to HSV-1-induced early phase IFN-[beta] production through, at least partially, promoting NF-[kappa]B activation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201535"
"cmi","Lineage relationship of CD8+ T cell subsets is revealed by progressive changes in the epigenetic landscape","To better elucidate epigenetic mechanisms that correlate with the dynamic gene expression program observed upon T-cell differentiation, we investigated the genomic landscape of histone modifications in naive and memory CD8+ T cells. Using a ChIP-Seq approach coupled with global gene expression profiling, we generated genome-wide histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) trimethylation maps in naive, T memory stem cells, central memory cells, and effector memory cells in order to gain insight into how histone architecture is remodeled during T cell differentiation. We show that H3K4me3 histone modifications are associated with activation of genes, while H3K27me3 is negatively correlated with gene expression at canonical loci and enhancers associated with T-cell metabolism, effector function, and memory. Our results also reveal histone modifications and gene expression signatures that distinguish the recently identified T memory stem cells from other CD8+ T-cell subsets. Taken together, our results suggest that CD8+ lymphocytes undergo chromatin remodeling in a progressive fashion. These findings have major implications for our understanding of peripheral T-cell ontogeny and the formation of immunological memory.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201532"

Mounting evidence has revealed that tissue resident Tregs control non-immunological processes of their target tissues and contribute to a plethora of human diseases. The identification of novel tissue-specific Tregs has highlighted their heterogeneity and complexity. This review summarizes the recent findings for visceral adipose tissue CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (VAT Tregs), muscle Tregs, bone Tregs and skin memory Tregs, with a focus on their unique functions in local tissues.

"cmi","The promise of [gamma][delta] T cells and the [gamma][delta] T cell receptor for cancer immunotherapy","[gamma][delta] T cells form an important part of adaptive immune responses against infections and malignant transformation. The molecular targets of human [gamma][delta] T cell receptors (TCRs) remain largely unknown, but recent studies have confirmed the recognition of phosphorylated prenyl metabolites, lipids in complex with CD1 molecules and markers of cellular stress. All of these molecules are upregulated on various cancer types, highlighting the potential importance of the [gamma][delta] T cell compartment in cancer immunosurveillance and paving the way for the use of [gamma][delta] TCRs in cancer therapy. Ligand recognition by the [gamma][delta] TCR often requires accessory/co-stimulatory stress molecules on both T cells and target cells; this cellular stress context therefore provides a failsafe against harmful self-reactivity. Unlike [alpha][beta] T cells, [gamma][delta] T cells recognise their targets irrespective of HLA haplotype and therefore offer exciting possibilities for off-the-shelf, pan-population cancer immunotherapies. Here, we present a review of known ligands of human [gamma][delta] T cells and discuss the promise of harnessing these cells for cancer treatment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201528"
"cmi","HAX1 deletion impairs BCR internalization and leads to delayed BCR-mediated apoptosis","Deletion of HAX1 in mice causes a severe reduction in the numbers of lymphocytes in the bone marrow and in the spleen. Additionally, B220+ B progenitor cells in the bone marrow are reduced, suggesting an important function of HAX1 in B cell development. HAX1 is thought to play a protective role in apoptotic processes; therefore, we investigated the role of HAX1 in bone marrow B progenitor cells and splenic B cells. We did not observe an effect on the survival of Hax1−/− bone marrow cells but detected enhanced survival of splenic Hax1−/− B cells upon in vitro starvation/growth-factor withdrawal. To explain this apparent inconsistency with previous reports of HAX1 function, we also studied the B cell receptor (BCR)-induced apoptosis of IgM-stimulated splenic naïve B cells and found that apoptosis decreased in these cells. We further found impaired internalization of the BCR from Hax1−/− splenic B cells after IgM crosslinking; this impaired internalization may result in decreased BCR signaling and, consequently, decreased BCR-mediated apoptosis. We measured HAX1 binding to the cytoplasmic domains of different Ig subtypes and identified KVKWI(V)F as the putative binding motif for HAX1 within the cytoplasmic domains. Because this motif can be found in almost all Ig subtypes, it is likely that HAX1 plays a general role in BCR-mediated internalization events and BCR-mediated apoptosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201518"
"cmi","Development of an antibody that neutralizes soluble IgE and eliminates IgE expressing B cells","Immunoglobulin E (IgE) plays a key role in allergic asthma and is a clinically validated target for monoclonal antibodies. Therapeutic anti-IgE antibodies block the interaction between IgE and the Fc epsilon (Fc[epsilon]) receptor, which eliminates or minimizes the allergic phenotype but does not typically curtail the ongoing production of IgE by B cells. We generated high-affinity anti-IgE antibodies (MEDI4212) that have the potential to both neutralize soluble IgE and eliminate IgE-expressing B-cells through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. MEDI4212 variants were generated that contain mutations in the Fc region of the antibody or alterations in fucosylation in order to enhance the antibody's affinity for Fc[gamma]RIIIa. All MEDI4212 variants bound to human IgE with affinities comparable to the wild-type (WT) antibody. Each variant was shown to inhibit the interaction between IgE and Fc[epsilon]RI, which translated into potent inhibition of Fc[gamma]RI-mediated function responses. Importantly, all variants bound similarly to IgE at the surface of membrane IgE expressing cells. However, MEDI4212 variants demonstrated enhanced affinity for Fc[gamma]RIIIa including the polymorphic variants at position 158. The improvement in Fc[gamma]RIIIa binding led to increased effector function in cell based assays using both engineered cell lines and class switched human IgE B cells. Through its superior suppression of IgE, we anticipate that effector function enhanced MEDI4212 may be able to neutralize high levels of soluble IgE and provide increased long-term benefit by eliminating the IgE expressing B cells before they differentiate and become IgE secreting plasma cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201519"
"cmi","Identification of an ideal adjuvant for receptor-binding domain-based subunit vaccines against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus","Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), an emerging infectious disease caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has garnered worldwide attention as a consequence of its continuous spread and pandemic potential, making the development of effective vaccines a high priority. We previously demonstrated that residues 377-588 of MERS-CoV spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a very promising MERS subunit vaccine candidate, capable of inducing potent neutralization antibody responses. In this study, we sought to identify an adjuvant that optimally enhanced the immunogenicity of S377-588 protein fused with Fc of human IgG (S377-588-Fc). Specifically, we compared several commercially available adjuvants, including Freund's adjuvant, aluminum, Monophosphoryl lipid A, Montanide ISA51 and MF59 with regard to their capacity to enhance the immunogenicity of this subunit vaccine. In the absence of adjuvant, S377-588-Fc alone induced readily detectable neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses in immunized mice. However, incorporating an adjuvant improved its immunogenicity. Particularly, among the aforementioned adjuvants evaluated, MF59 is the most potent as judged by its superior ability to induce the highest titers of IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a subtypes, and neutralizing antibodies. The addition of MF59 significantly augmented the immunogenicity of S377-588-Fc to induce strong IgG and neutralizing antibody responses as well as protection against MERS-CoV infection in mice, suggesting that MF59 is an optimal adjuvant for MERS-CoV RBD-based subunit vaccines.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201503"
"cmi","IRG1 induced by heme oxygenase-1/carbon monoxide inhibits LPS-mediated sepsis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production","The immunoresponsive gene 1 (IRG1) protein has crucial functions in embryonic implantation and neurodegeneration. IRG1 promotes endotoxin tolerance by increasing A20 expression in macrophages through reactive oxygen species (ROS). The cytoprotective protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which generates endogenous carbon monoxide (CO), is expressed in the lung during Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) tolerance and cross tolerance. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms and functional links between IRG1 and HO-1 in the innate immune system remain unknown. In the present study, we found that the CO releasing molecule-2 (CORM-2) and chemical inducers of HO-1 increased IRG1 expression in a time- and dose-dependent fashion in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of HO-1 activity by zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) and HO-1 siRNA significantly reduced expression of IRG1 under these conditions. In addition, treatment with CO and HO-1 induction significantly increased A20 expression, which was reversed by ZnPP and HO-1 siRNA. LPS-stimulated TNF-[alpha] was significantly decreased, whereas IRG1 and A20 were increased by CORM-2 application and HO-1 induction, which in turn were abrogated by ZnPP. Interestingly, siRNA against IRG1 and A20 reversed the effects of CO and HO-1 on LPS-stimulated TNF-[alpha] production. Additionally, CO and HO-1 inducers significantly increased IRG1 and A20 expression and downregulated TNF-[alpha] production in a LPS-stimulated sepsis mice model. Furthermore, the effects of CO and HO-1 on TNF-[alpha] production were significantly reversed when ZnPP was administered. In conclusion, CO and HO-1 induction regulates IRG1 and A20 expression, leading to inhibition of inflammation in vitro and in an in vivo mice model.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201502"
"cmi","[alpha][beta] T cell receptors as predictors of health and disease","The diversity of antigen receptors and the specificity it underlies are the hallmarks of the cellular arm of the adaptive immune system. T and B lymphocytes are indeed truly unique in their ability to generate receptors capable of recognizing virtually any pathogen. It has been known for several decades that T lymphocytes recognize short peptides derived from degraded proteins presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules at the cell surface. Interaction between peptide-MHC (pMHC) and the T cell receptor (TCR) is central to both thymic selection and peripheral antigen recognition. It is widely assumed that TCR diversity is required, or at least highly desirable, to provide sufficient immune coverage. However, a number of immune responses are associated with the selection of predictable, narrow, or skewed repertoires and public TCR chains. Here, we summarize the current knowledge on the formation of the TCR repertoire and its maintenance in health and disease. We also outline the various molecular mechanisms that govern the composition of the pre-selection, naive and antigen-specific TCR repertoires. Finally, we suggest that with the development of high-throughput sequencing, common TCR 'signatures' raised against specific antigens could provide important diagnostic biomarkers and surrogate predictors of disease onset, progression and outcome.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2014134"
"cmi","Emerging roles of interferon-stimulated genes in the innate immune response to hepatitis C virus infection","Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major viral cause of chronic liver disease, frequently progresses to steatosis and cirrhosis, which can lead to hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV infection strongly induces host responses, such as the activation of the unfolded protein response, autophagy and the innate immune response. Upon HCV infection, the host induces the interferon (IFN)-mediated frontline defense to limit virus replication. Conversely, HCV employs diverse strategies to escape host innate immune surveillance. Type I IFN elicits its antiviral actions by inducing a wide array of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which these ISGs participate in IFN-mediated anti-HCV actions remain largely unknown. In this review, we first outline the signaling pathways known to be involved in the production of type I IFN and ISGs and the tactics that HCV uses to subvert innate immunity. Then, we summarize the effector mechanisms of scaffold ISGs known to modulate IFN function in HCV replication. We also highlight the potential functions of emerging ISGs, which were identified from genome-wide siRNA screens, in HCV replication. Finally, we discuss the functions of several cellular determinants critical for regulating host immunity in HCV replication. This review will provide a basis for understanding the complexity and functionality of the pleiotropic IFN system in HCV infection. Elucidation of the specificity and the mode of action of these emerging ISGs will also help to identify novel cellular targets against which effective HCV therapeutics can be developed.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2014127"

However, we do not yet know whether MSCs have similar effects on the other subsets of Treg cells. Herein, we studied the effects of MSCs on CD8+CD28− Treg cells and found that the MSCs could not only increase the proportion of CD8+CD28− T cells, but also enhance CD8+CD28−T cells' ability of hampering naive CD4+ T-cell proliferation and activation, decreasing the production of IFN-[gamma] by activated CD4+ T cells and inducing the apoptosis of activated CD4+ T cells. Mechanistically, the MSCs affected the functions of the CD8+CD28− T cells partially through moderate upregulating the expression of IL-10 and FasL. The MSCs had no distinct effect on the shift from CD8+CD28+ T cells to CD8+CD28− T cells, but did increase the proportion of CD8+CD28− T cells by reducing their rate of apoptosis. In summary, this study shows that MSCs can enhance the regulatory function of CD8+CD28− Treg cells, shedding new light on MSCs-mediated immune regulation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2014118"

Classical MHC I molecules present antigenic peptide ligands on infected cells to CD8+ T cells, whereas a key function for non-classical MHC I molecules is to mediate inhibitory or activating stimuli in natural killer (NK) cells. The structural diversity of MHC I puts immense pressure on persisting viruses, including cytomegaloviruses. The very large coding capacity of the human cytomegalovirus allows it to express a whole arsenal of immunoevasive factors assigned to individual MHC class I targets. This review summarizes achievements from more than two decades of intense research on how human cytomegalovirus manipulates MHC I molecules and escapes elimination by the immune system.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2014105"
"cmi","CXCR4 expression affects overall survival of HCC patients whereas CXCR7 expression does not","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a heterogeneous disease with a poor prognosis and limited markers for predicting patient survival. Because chemokines and chemokine receptors play numerous and integral roles in HCC disease progression, the CXCR4-CXCL12-CXCR7 axis was studied in HCC patients. CXCR4 and CXCR7 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 86 HCC patients (training cohort) and validated in 42 unrelated HCC patients (validation cohort). CXCR4 levels were low in 22.1% of patients, intermediate in 30.2%, and high in 47.7%, whereas CXCR7 levels were low in 9.3% of patients, intermediate in 44.2% and high in 46.5% of the patients in the training cohort. When correlated to patient outcome, only CXCR4 affected overall survival (P=0.03). CXCR4-CXCL12-CXCR7 mRNA levels were examined in 33/86 patients. Interestingly, the common CXCR4-CXCR7 ligand CXCL12 was expressed at significantly lower levels in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal liver (P=0.032). The expression and function of CXCR4 and CXCR7 was also analyzed in several human HCC cell lines. CXCR4 was expressed in Huh7, Hep3B, SNU398, SNU449 and SNU475 cells, whereas CXCR7 was expressed in HepG2, Huh7, SNU449 and SNU475 cells. Huh7, SNU449 and SNU475 cells migrated toward CXCL12, and this migration was inhibited by AMD3100/anti-CXCR4 and by CCX771/anti-CXCR7. Moreover, SNU449 and Huh7 cells exhibited matrix invasion in the presence of CXCL12 and CXCL11, a ligand exclusive to CXCR7. In conclusion, CXCR4 affects the prognosis of HCC patients but CXCR7 does not. Therefore, the CXCR4-CXCL12-CXCR7 axis plays a role in the interaction of HCC with the surrounding normal tissue and represents a suitable therapeutic target.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2014102"
"cmi","Toll-like receptor agonists shape the immune responses to a mannose receptor-targeted cancer vaccine","Previous studies have documented that selective delivery of protein antigens to cells expressing mannose receptor (MR) can lead to enhanced immune responses. We postulated that agents that influenced the MR expression level, and the activation and migration status of MR-expressing antigen presenting cells, would modulate immune responses to MR-targeted vaccines. To address this question, we investigated the effect of clinically used adjuvants in human MR transgenic (hMR-Tg) mice immunized with an MR-targeting cancer vaccine composed of the human anti-MR monoclonal antibody B11 fused with the oncofetal protein, human chorionic gonadotropin beta chain (hCG[beta]), and referred to as B11-hCG[beta]. We found that humoral responses to low doses of B11-hCG[beta] could be enhanced by prior administration of GM-CSF, which upregulated MR expression in vivo. However, co-administration of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, poly-ICLC and/or CpG with B11-hCG[beta] was required to elicit Th1 immunity, as measured by antigen-specific T-cell production of IFN-[gamma]. The TLR agonists were shown to increase the number of vaccine-containing cells in the draining lymph nodes of immunized hMR-Tg mice. In particular, with B11-hCG[beta] and poly-ICLC, a dramatic increase in vaccine-positive cells was observed in the T-cell areas of the lymph nodes, compared to the vaccine alone or combined with GM-CSF. Importantly, the absence of the TLR agonists during the priming immunization led to antigen-specific tolerance. Therefore, this study provides insight into the mechanisms by which adjuvants can augment immune responses to B11-hCG[beta] and have implications for the rationale design of clinical studies combining MR-targeted vaccination with TLR agonists.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi2014100"
"cmi","Cytomegalovirus immune evasion by perturbation of endosomal trafficking","Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs), members of the herpesvirus family, have evolved a variety of mechanisms to evade the immune response to survive in infected hosts and to establish latent infection. They effectively hide infected cells from the effector mechanisms of adaptive immunity by eliminating cellular proteins (major histocompatibility Class I and Class II molecules) from the cell surface that display viral antigens to CD8 and CD4 T lymphocytes. CMVs also successfully escape recognition and elimination of infected cells by natural killer (NK) cells, effector cells of innate immunity, either by mimicking NK cell inhibitory ligands or by downregulating NK cell-activating ligands. To accomplish these immunoevasion functions, CMVs encode several proteins that function in the biosynthetic pathway by inhibiting the assembly and trafficking of cellular proteins that participate in immune recognition and thereby, block their appearance at the cell surface. However, elimination of these proteins from the cell surface can also be achieved by perturbation of their endosomal route and subsequent relocation from the cell surface into intracellular compartments. Namely, the physiological route of every cellular protein, including immune recognition molecules, is characterized by specific features that determine its residence time at the cell surface. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of endocytic trafficking of immune recognition molecules and perturbations of the endosomal system during infection with CMVs and other members of the herpesvirus family that contribute to their immune evasion mechanisms.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201485"
"cmi","Early CD8 T-cell memory precursors and terminal effectors exhibit equipotent in vivo degranulation","Early after priming, effector CD8 T cells are distinguished into memory precursor and short-lived effector cell subsets (MPECs and SLECs). Here, we delineated a distinct in vivo heterogeneity in killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG-1) expression, which was strongly associated with diverse MPEC and SLEC fates. These in vivo MPECs and SLECs expressed equivalent levels of cytotoxic molecules and effector cytokines. Using a unique in vivo degranulation assay, we found that the MPECs and SLECs similarly encountered infected target cells and elaborated equivalent levels of cytotoxicity in vivo. These data provide direct in vivo evidence that memory-fated cells pass through a robust effector phase. Additionally, the preferential localization of the MPECs in the lymph nodes, where a lesser degree of cytotoxicity was elaborated, suggests that the MPECs may be protected from excessive stimulation and terminal differentiation by virtue of their differential tissue localization. These data provide novel mechanistic insights into the linear decreasing potential model of memory differentiation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201448"
"cmi","Immune cells in term and preterm labor","Labor resembles an inflammatory response that includes secretion of cytokines/chemokines by resident and infiltrating immune cells into reproductive tissues and the maternal/fetal interface. Untimely activation of these inflammatory pathways leads to preterm labor, which can result in preterm birth. Preterm birth is a major determinant of neonatal mortality and morbidity; therefore, the elucidation of the process of labor at a cellular and molecular level is essential for understanding the pathophysiology of preterm labor. Here, we summarize the role of innate and adaptive immune cells in the physiological or pathological activation of labor. We review published literature regarding the role of innate and adaptive immune cells in the cervix, myometrium, fetal membranes, decidua and the fetus in late pregnancy and labor at term and preterm. Accumulating evidence suggests that innate immune cells (neutrophils, macrophages and mast cells) mediate the process of labor by releasing pro-inflammatory factors such as cytokines, chemokines and matrix metalloproteinases. Adaptive immune cells (T-cell subsets and B cells) participate in the maintenance of fetomaternal tolerance during pregnancy, and an alteration in their function or abundance may lead to labor at term or preterm. Also, immune cells that bridge the innate and adaptive immune systems (natural killer T (NKT) cells and dendritic cells (DCs)) seem to participate in the pathophysiology of preterm labor. In conclusion, a balance between innate and adaptive immune cells is required in order to sustain pregnancy; an alteration of this balance will lead to labor at term or preterm.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201446"
"cmi","Extracellular vesicles and reproduction-promotion of successful pregnancy","Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound complexes secreted from cells under both physiological and pathological conditions. They contain proteins, nucleic acids and lipids and act as messengers for cell-cell communication and signalling, particularly between immune cells. EV research is a rapidly evolving and expanding field, and it appears that all biological fluids contain very large numbers of EVs; they are produced from all cells that have been studied to date, and are known to have roles in several reproductive processes. This review analyses the evidence for the role of EVs throughout human reproduction, starting with the paternal and maternal gametes, followed by the establishment and continuation of successful pregnancies, with specific focus, where possible, on the interaction of EVs with the maternal immune system. Importantly, variations within the EV populations are identified in various reproductive disorders, such as pre-term labour and pre-eclampsia.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201442"
"cmi","Effect of everolimus on the immunomodulation of the human neutrophil inflammatory response and activation","The primary cause of mortality at 5 years following a cardiac transplantation is the development of atherosclerosis, termed coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV). This pathology is characterized by diffused intimal hyperplasia and emanates from coronary arterial injuries caused by immune inflammatory cells. Neutrophils play an important role in this inflammatory process; however, their potential participation in the pathogenesis of CAV is poorly understood. Despite their essential contribution to the prevention of graft rejection, immunosuppressive drugs could have detrimental effects owing to their pro-inflammatory activities. Thus, we investigated the impact of different immunosuppressive drugs on the inflammatory response of neutrophils isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers. Under basal conditions, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus) had the most potent anti-inflammatory effect, decreasing both IL-8 release (≈−80%) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release (≈−65%) and preserving the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). In TNF-[alpha]-treated neutrophils, pre-incubation with everolimus provided the most potent effect, simultaneously reducing the release of both VEGF and IL-8 while doubling the release of IL-1RA. This latter effect of everolimus was maintained even when administered in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs. Sirolimus and everolimus decreased the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-[alpha]-induced adhesion of neutrophils to human endothelial cells and human extracellular matrix. This effect was largely dependent on the ability of these compounds to alter [beta]2-integrin/CD18 activation. Our results suggest a potential mechanism for the beneficial effect of everolimus in the prevention of CAV in heart transplant recipients.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201424"
"cmi","Chemerin aggravates DSS-induced colitis by suppressing M2 macrophage polarization","Chemerin is present in various inflammatory sites and is closely involved in tissue inflammation. Recent studies have demonstrated that chemerin treatment can cause either anti-inflammatory or pro-inflammatory effects according to the disease model being investigated. Elevated circulating chemerin was recently found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); however, the role of chemerin in intestinal inflammation remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that the administration of exogenous chemerin (aa17-156) aggravated the severity of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis, which was characterized by higher clinical scores, extensive mucosal damage and significantly increased local and systemic production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, TNF-[alpha] and interferon (IFN-[gamma]). Interestingly, chemerin did not appear to influence the magnitudes of inflammatory infiltrates in the colons, but did result in significantly decreased colonic expression of M2 macrophage-associated genes, including Arginase 1 (Arg-1), Ym1, FIZZ1 and IL-10, following DSS exposure, suggesting an impaired M2 macrophage skewing in vivo. Furthermore, an in vitro experiment showed that the addition of chemerin directly suppressed M2 macrophage-associated gene expression and STAT6 phosphorylation in IL-4-stimulated macrophages. Significantly elevated chemerin levels were found in colons from DSS-exposed mice and from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and appeared to positively correlate with disease severity. Moreover, the in vivo administration of neutralizing anti-chemerin antibody significantly improved intestinal inflammation following DSS exposure. Taken together, our findings reveal a pro-inflammatory role for chemerin in DSS-induced colitis and the ability of chemerin to suppress the anti-inflammatory M2 macrophage response. Our study also suggests that upregulated chemerin in inflamed colons may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201415"
"cmi","Long-term exposure to decabrominated diphenyl ether impairs CD8 T-cell function in adult mice","Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants that accumulate to high levels in human populations that are subject to occupational or regional industry exposure. PBDEs have been shown to affect human neuronal, endocrine and reproductive systems, but their effect on the immune system is not well understood. In this study, experimental adult mice were intragastrically administered 2,2',3,3',4,4',5,5',6,6'-decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) at doses of 8, 80 or 800 mg/kg of body weight (bw) at 2-day intervals. Our results showed that continuous exposure to BDE-209 resulted in high levels of BDE-209 in the plasma that approached the levels found in people who work in professions with high risks of PDBE exposure. Reduced leukocytes, decreased cytokine (IFN-[gamma], IL-2 and TNF-[alpha]) production and lower CD8 T-cell proliferation were observed in the mice exposed to BDE-209. Additionally, mice with long-term BDE-209 exposure had lower numbers of antigen-specific CD8 T cells after immunization with recombinant Listeria monocytogenes expressing ovalbumin (rLm-OVA) and the OVA-specific CD8 T cells had reduced functionality. Taken together, our study demonstrates that continuous BDE-209 exposure causes adverse effects on the number and functionality of immune cells in adult mice.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201416"
"cmi","The shrimp IKK-NF-[kappa]B signaling pathway regulates antimicrobial peptide expression and may be subverted by white spot syndrome virus to facilitate viral gene expression","The I[kappa]B kinases IKK[alpha] and IKK[beta] and the IKK-related kinases TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKK[epsilon] are the master regulators of the NF-[kappa]B signaling pathway. Although this pathway has been extensively studied in mammals, less attention has been paid in crustaceans, which have significant economic value. Here, we report the cloning and functional studies of two IKK homologs, LvIKK[beta] and LvIKK[epsilon], from Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei. LvIKK[beta] and LvIKK[epsilon] mRNAs are widely expressed in different tissues and are responsive to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. When overexpressed in Drosophila S2 cells, LvIKK[beta] but not LvIKK[epsilon] activates the promoters of NF-[kappa]B pathway-controlled antimicrobial peptide genes (AMPs), such as the Penaeidins (PENs). In HEK 293T cells, both LvIKK[beta] and LvIKK[epsilon] activate an NF-[kappa]B reporter. The silencing of LvIKK[beta] or LvIKK[epsilon] using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) decreases the expression of L. vannamei AMPs, including PENs, lysozyme and crustins. Intriguingly, LvIKK[beta]- or LvIKK[epsilon]-silenced L. vannamei are resistant to WSSV infection. We hypothesized that successful infection with WSSV requires the activation of the IKK-NF-[kappa]B signaling pathway to modulate viral gene expression. We constructed luciferase reporters for 147 WSSV genes. By screening, we found that the WSV051, WSV059, WSV069, WSV083, WSV090, WSV107, WSV244, WSV303, WSV371 and WSV445 promoters can be activated by LvIKK[beta] or LvIKK[epsilon] in Drosophila S2 cells. Taken together, our results reveal that LvIKK[beta] and LvIKK[epsilon] may participate in the regulation of shrimp AMPs and that WSSV may subvert the L. vannamei IKK-NF-[kappa]B signaling pathway to facilitate viral gene expression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201330"
"cmi","TLR8: the forgotten relative revindicated","The endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs) TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 are important in sensing foreign nucleic acids encountered by phagocytes. Because TLR8 was initially thought to be non-functional in mice, less is known about TLR8 than the genetically and functionally related TLR7. Originally associated with the recognition of single-stranded RNA of viral origin, there is now evidence that human TLR8 is also able to sense bacterial RNA released within phagosomal vacuoles, inducing the production of both nuclear factor (NF)-[kappa]B-dependent cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs), such as IFN-[beta]. The functions of TLR8 extend beyond the recognition of foreign pathogens and include cross-talk with other endosomal TLRs, a process that may also have a role in the generation of autoimmunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cmi201238"
