"cr","The complete and fully-phased diploid genome of a male Han Chinese","Since the release of the complete human genome, the priority of human genomic study has now been shifting towards closing gaps in ethnic diversity. Here, we present a fully phased and well-annotated diploid human genome from a Han Chinese male individual (CN1), in which the assemblies of both haploids achieve the telomere-to-telomere (T2T) level. Comparison of this diploid genome with the CHM13 haploid T2T genome revealed significant variations in the centromere. Outside the centromere, we discovered 11,413 structural variations, including numerous novel ones. We also detected thousands of CN1 alleles that have accumulated high substitution rates and a few that have been under positive selection in the East Asian population. Further, we found that CN1 outperforms CHM13 as a reference genome in mapping and variant calling for the East Asian population owing to the distinct structural variants of the two references. Comparison of SNP calling for a large cohort of 8869 Chinese genomes using CN1 and CHM13 as reference respectively showed that the reference bias profoundly impacts rare SNP calling, with nearly 2 million rare SNPs miss-called with different reference genomes. Finally, applying the CN1 as a reference, we discovered 5.80 Mb and 4.21 Mb putative introgression sequences from Neanderthal and Denisovan, respectively, including many East Asian specific ones undetected using CHM13 as the reference. Our analyses reveal the advances of using CN1 as a reference for population genomic studies and paleo-genomic studies. This complete genome will serve as an alternative reference for future genomic studies on the East Asian population.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00849-5"
"cr","α-myosin heavy chain lactylation maintains sarcomeric structure and function and alleviates the development of heart failure","The sarcomeric interaction of α-myosin heavy chain (α-MHC) with Titin is vital for cardiac structure and contraction. However, the mechanism regulating this interaction in normal and failing hearts remains unknown. Lactate is a crucial energy substrate of the heart. Here, we identify that α-MHC undergoes lactylation on lysine 1897 to regulate the interaction of α-MHC with Titin. We observed a reduction of α-MHC K1897 lactylation in mice and patients with heart failure. Loss of K1897 lactylation in α-MHC K1897R knock-in mice reduces α-MHC–Titin interaction and leads to impaired cardiac structure and function. Furthermore, we identified that p300 and Sirtuin 1 act as the acyltransferase and delactylase of α-MHC, respectively. Decreasing lactate production by chemical or genetic manipulation reduces α-MHC lactylation, impairs α-MHC–Titin interaction and worsens heart failure. By contrast, upregulation of the lactate concentration by administering sodium lactate or inhibiting the pivotal lactate transporter in cardiomyocytes can promote α-MHC K1897 lactylation and α-MHC–Titin interaction, thereby alleviating heart failure. In conclusion, α-MHC lactylation is dynamically regulated and an important determinant of overall cardiac structure and function. Excessive lactate efflux and consumption by cardiomyocytes may decrease the intracellular lactate level, which is the main cause of reduced α-MHC K1897 lactylation during myocardial injury. Our study reveals that cardiac metabolism directly modulates the sarcomeric structure and function through lactate-dependent modification of α-MHC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00844-w"
"cr","An invasive zone in human liver cancer identified by Stereo-seq promotes hepatocyte–tumor cell crosstalk, local immunosuppression and tumor progression","Dissecting and understanding the cancer ecosystem, especially that around the tumor margins, which have strong implications for tumor cell infiltration and invasion, are essential for exploring the mechanisms of tumor metastasis and developing effective new treatments. Using a novel tumor border scanning and digitization model enabled by nanoscale resolution-SpaTial Enhanced REsolution Omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq), we identified a 500 µm-wide zone centered around the tumor border in patients with liver cancer, referred to as “the invasive zone”. We detected strong immunosuppression, metabolic reprogramming, and severely damaged hepatocytes in this zone. We also identified a subpopulation of damaged hepatocytes with increased expression of serum amyloid A1 and A2 (referred to collectively as SAAs) located close to the border on the paratumor side. Overexpression of CXCL6 in adjacent malignant cells could induce activation of the JAK-STAT3 pathway in nearby hepatocytes, which subsequently caused SAAs’ overexpression in these hepatocytes. Furthermore, overexpression and secretion of SAAs by hepatocytes in the invasive zone could lead to the recruitment of macrophages and M2 polarization, further promoting local immunosuppression, potentially resulting in tumor progression. Clinical association analysis in additional five independent cohorts of patients with primary and secondary liver cancer (n = 423) showed that patients with overexpression of SAAs in the invasive zone had a worse prognosis. Further in vivo experiments using mouse liver tumor models in situ confirmed that the knockdown of genes encoding SAAs in hepatocytes decreased macrophage accumulation around the tumor border and delayed tumor growth. The identification and characterization of a novel invasive zone in human cancer patients not only add an important layer of understanding regarding the mechanisms of tumor invasion and metastasis, but may also pave the way for developing novel therapeutic strategies for advanced liver cancer and other solid tumors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00831-1"
"cr","A direct spino-cortical circuit bypassing the thalamus modulates nociception","Nociceptive signals are usually transmitted to layer 4 neurons in somatosensory cortex via the spinothalamic-thalamocortical pathway. The layer 5 corticospinal neurons in sensorimotor cortex are reported to receive the output of neurons in superficial layers; and their descending axons innervate the spinal cord to regulate basic sensorimotor functions. Here, we show that a subset of layer 5 neurons receives spinal inputs through a direct spino-cortical circuit bypassing the thalamus, and thus define these neurons as spino-cortical recipient neurons (SCRNs). Morphological studies revealed that the branches from spinal ascending axons formed a kind of disciform structure with the descending axons from SCRNs in the basilar pontine nucleus (BPN). Electron microscopy and calcium imaging further confirmed that the axon terminals from spinal ascending neurons and SCRNs made functional synaptic contacts in the BPN, linking the ascending sensory pathway to the descending motor control pathway. Furthermore, behavioral tests indicated that the spino-cortical connection in the BPN was involved in nociceptive responses. In vivo calcium imaging showed that SCRNs responded to peripheral noxious stimuli faster than neighboring layer 4 cortical neurons in awake mice. Manipulating activities of SCRNs could modulate nociceptive behaviors. Therefore, this direct spino-cortical circuit represents a noncanonical pathway, allowing a fast sensory-motor transition of the brain in response to noxious stimuli.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00832-0"
"cr","Structural insights into mechanisms of Argonaute protein-associated NADase activation in bacterial immunity","Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a central metabolite in cellular processes. Depletion of NAD+ has been demonstrated to be a prevalent theme in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic immune responses. Short prokaryotic Argonaute proteins (Agos) are associated with NADase domain-containing proteins (TIR-APAZ or SIR2-APAZ) encoded in the same operon. They confer immunity against mobile genetic elements, such as bacteriophages and plasmids, by inducing NAD+ depletion upon recognition of target nucleic acids. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of such prokaryotic NADase/Ago immune systems remain unknown. Here, we report multiple cryo-EM structures of NADase/Ago complexes from two distinct systems (TIR-APAZ/Ago and SIR2-APAZ/Ago). Target DNA binding triggers tetramerization of the TIR-APAZ/Ago complex by a cooperative self-assembly mechanism, while the heterodimeric SIR2-APAZ/Ago complex does not assemble into higher-order oligomers upon target DNA binding. However, the NADase activities of these two systems are unleashed via a similar closed-to-open transition of the catalytic pocket, albeit by different mechanisms. Furthermore, a functionally conserved sensor loop is employed to inspect the guide RNA–target DNA base pairing and facilitate the conformational rearrangement of Ago proteins required for the activation of these two systems. Overall, our study reveals the mechanistic diversity and similarity of Ago protein-associated NADase systems in prokaryotic immune response.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00839-7"
"cr","Structural insights into dimerization and activation of the mGlu2–mGlu3 and mGlu2–mGlu4 heterodimers","Heterodimerization of the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlus) has shown importance in the functional modulation of the receptors and offers potential drug targets for treating central nervous system diseases. However, due to a lack of molecular details of the mGlu heterodimers, understanding of the mechanisms underlying mGlu heterodimerization and activation is limited. Here we report twelve cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the mGlu2–mGlu3 and mGlu2–mGlu4 heterodimers in different conformational states, including inactive, intermediate inactive, intermediate active and fully active conformations. These structures provide a full picture of conformational rearrangement of mGlu2–mGlu3 upon activation. The Venus flytrap domains undergo a sequential conformational change, while the transmembrane domains exhibit a substantial rearrangement from an inactive, symmetric dimer with diverse dimerization patterns to an active, asymmetric dimer in a conserved dimerization mode. Combined with functional data, these structures reveal that stability of the inactive conformations of the subunits and the subunit–G protein interaction pattern are determinants of asymmetric signal transduction of the heterodimers. Furthermore, a novel binding site for two mGlu4 positive allosteric modulators was observed in the asymmetric dimer interfaces of the mGlu2–mGlu4 heterodimer and mGlu4 homodimer, and may serve as a drug recognition site. These findings greatly extend our knowledge about signal transduction of the mGlus.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00830-2"
"cr","A novel N6-Deoxyadenine methyltransferase METL-9 modulates C. elegans immunity via dichotomous mechanisms","N6-Methyldeoxyadenine (6mA) has been rediscovered as a DNA modification with potential biological function in metazoans. However, the physiological function and regulatory mechanisms regarding the establishment, maintenance and removal of 6mA in eukaryotes are still poorly understood. Here we show that genomic 6mA levels change in response to pathogenic infection in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). We further identify METL-9 as the methyltransferase that catalyzes DNA 6mA modifications upon pathogen infection. Deficiency of METL-9 impairs the induction of innate immune response genes and renders the animals more susceptible to pathogen infection. Interestingly, METL-9 functions through both 6mA-dependent and -independent mechanisms to transcriptionally regulate innate immunity. Our findings reveal that 6mA is a functional DNA modification in immunomodulation in C. elegans.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00826-y"
"cr","Structure and transport mechanism of the human calcium pump SPCA1","Secretory-pathway Ca2+-ATPases (SPCAs) play critical roles in maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis, but the exact mechanism of SPCAs-mediated Ca2+ transport remains unclear. Here, we determined six cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human SPCA1 (hSPCA1) in a series of intermediate states, revealing a near-complete conformational cycle. With the aid of molecular dynamics simulations, these structures offer a clear structural basis for Ca2+ entry and release in hSPCA1. We found that hSPCA1 undergoes unique conformational changes during ATP binding and phosphorylation compared to other well-studied P-type II ATPases. In addition, we observed a conformational distortion of the Ca2+-binding site induced by the separation of transmembrane helices 4L and 6, unveiling a distinct Ca2+ release mechanism. Particularly, we determined a structure of the long-sought CaE2P state of P-type IIA ATPases, providing valuable insights into the Ca2+ transport cycle. Together, these findings enhance our understanding of Ca2+ transport by hSPCA1 and broaden our knowledge of P-type ATPases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00827-x"

"cr","The phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate-Rab35 axis regulates migrasome formation","Migrasomes are recently discovered organelles, which are formed on the ends or branch points of retraction fibers at the trailing edge of migrating cells. Previously, we showed that recruitment of integrins to the site of migrasome formation is essential for migrasome biogenesis. In this study, we found that prior to migrasome formation, PIP5K1A, a PI4P kinase which converts PI4P into PI(4,5)P2, is recruited to migrasome formation sites. The recruitment of PIP5K1A results in generation of PI(4,5)P2 at the migrasome formation site. Once accumulated, PI(4,5)P2 recruits Rab35 to the migrasome formation site by interacting with the C-terminal polybasic cluster of Rab35. We further demonstrated that active Rab35 promotes migrasome formation by recruiting and concentrating integrin α5 at migrasome formation sites, which is likely mediated by the interaction between integrin α5 and Rab35. Our study identifies the upstream signaling events orchestrating migrasome biogenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00811-5"
"cr","Disruption of ER ion homeostasis maintained by an ER anion channel CLCC1 contributes to ALS-like pathologies","Although anion channel activities have been demonstrated in sarcoplasmic reticulum/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER), their molecular identities and functions remain unclear. Here, we link rare variants of Chloride Channel CLIC Like 1 (CLCC1) to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like pathologies. We demonstrate that CLCC1 is a pore-forming component of an ER anion channel and that ALS-associated mutations impair channel conductance. CLCC1 forms homomultimers and its channel activity is inhibited by luminal Ca2+ but facilitated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). We identified conserved residues D25 and D181 in CLCC1 N-terminus responsible for Ca2+ binding and luminal Ca2+-mediated inhibition on channel open probability and K298 in CLCC1 intraluminal loop as the critical PIP2-sensing residue. CLCC1 maintains steady-state [Cl–]ER and [K+]ER and ER morphology and regulates ER Ca2+ homeostasis, including internal Ca2+ release and steady-state [Ca2+]ER. ALS-associated mutant forms of CLCC1 increase steady-state [Cl–]ER and impair ER Ca2+ homeostasis, and animals with the ALS-associated mutations are sensitized to stress challenge-induced protein misfolding. Phenotypic comparisons of multiple Clcc1 loss-of-function alleles, including ALS-associated mutations, reveal a CLCC1 dosage dependence in the severity of disease phenotypes in vivo. Similar to CLCC1 rare variations dominant in ALS, 10% of K298A heterozygous mice developed ALS-like symptoms, pointing to a mechanism of channelopathy dominant-negatively induced by a loss-of-function mutation. Conditional knockout of Clcc1 cell-autonomously causes motor neuron loss and ER stress, misfolded protein accumulation, and characteristic ALS pathologies in the spinal cord. Thus, our findings support that disruption of ER ion homeostasis maintained by CLCC1 contributes to ALS-like pathologies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00798-z"
"cr","Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the developmental program underlying proximal–distal patterning of the human lung at the embryonic stage","The lung is the primary respiratory organ in human, in which the proximal airway and the distal alveoli are responsible for air conduction and gas exchange, respectively. However, the regulation of proximal–distal patterning at the embryonic stage of human lung development is largely unknown. Here we investigated the early lung development of human embryos at weeks 4–8 post fertilization (Carnegie stages 12–21) using single-cell RNA sequencing, and obtained a transcriptomic atlas of 169,686 cells. We observed discernible gene expression patterns of proximal and distal epithelia at week 4, upon the initiation of lung organogenesis. Moreover, we identified novel transcriptional regulators of the patterning of proximal (e.g., THRB and EGR3) and distal (e.g., ETV1 and SOX6) epithelia. Further dissection revealed various stromal cell populations, including an early-embryonic BDNF+ population, providing a proximal–distal patterning niche with spatial specificity. In addition, we elucidated the cell fate bifurcation and maturation of airway and vascular smooth muscle progenitor cells at the early stage of lung development. Together, our study expands the scope of human lung developmental biology at early embryonic stages. The discovery of intrinsic transcriptional regulators and novel niche providers deepens the understanding of epithelial proximal–distal patterning in human lung development, opening up new avenues for regenerative medicine.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00802-6"
"cr","A lncRNA from an inflammatory bowel disease risk locus maintains intestinal host-commensal homeostasis","Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are known to have complex, genetically influenced etiologies, involving dysfunctional interactions between the intestinal immune system and the microbiome. Here, we characterized how the RNA transcript from an IBD-associated long non-coding RNA locus (“CARINH-Colitis Associated IRF1 antisense Regulator of Intestinal Homeostasis”) protects against IBD. We show that CARINH and its neighboring gene coding for the transcription factor IRF1 together form a feedforward loop in host myeloid cells. The loop activation is sustained by microbial factors, and functions to maintain the intestinal host-commensal homeostasis via the induction of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-18BP and anti-microbial factors called guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs). Extending these mechanistic insights back to humans, we demonstrate that the function of the CARINH/IRF1 loop is conserved between mice and humans. Genetically, the T allele of rs2188962, the most probable causal variant of IBD within the CARINH locus from the human genetics study, impairs the inducible expression of the CARINH/IRF1 loop and thus increases genetic predisposition to IBD. Our study thus illustrates how an IBD-associated lncRNA maintains intestinal homeostasis and protects the host against colitis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00790-7"
"cr","Dietary cysteine drives body fat loss via FMRFamide signaling in Drosophila and mouse","Obesity imposes a global health threat and calls for safe and effective therapeutic options. Here, we found that protein-rich diet significantly reduced body fat storage in fruit flies, which was largely attributed to dietary cysteine intake. Mechanistically, dietary cysteine increased the production of a neuropeptide FMRFamide (FMRFa). Enhanced FMRFa activity simultaneously promoted energy expenditure and suppressed food intake through its cognate receptor (FMRFaR), both contributing to the fat loss effect. In the fat body, FMRFa signaling promoted lipolysis by increasing PKA and lipase activity. In sweet-sensing gustatory neurons, FMRFa signaling suppressed appetitive perception and hence food intake. We also demonstrated that dietary cysteine worked in a similar way in mice via neuropeptide FF (NPFF) signaling, a mammalian RFamide peptide. In addition, dietary cysteine or FMRFa/NPFF administration provided protective effect against metabolic stress in flies and mice without behavioral abnormalities. Therefore, our study reveals a novel target for the development of safe and effective therapies against obesity and related metabolic diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00800-8"

Our previous study classified TNBCs into four subtypes with putative therapeutic targets. Here, we report the final results of FUTURE, a phase II umbrella trial designed to explore whether the subtyping-based strategy may improve the outcomes in metastatic TNBC patients. A total of 141 patients with a median of three previous lines of therapies in the metastatic setting were enrolled in seven parallel arms. Confirmed objective responses were achieved in 42 patients (29.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 22.4–38.1). The median values of progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.4 (95% CI: 2.7–4.2) and 10.7 (95% CI: 9.1–12.3) months, respectively. Given Bayesian predictive probability, efficacy boundaries were achieved in four arms. Furthermore, integrated genomic and clinicopathological profiling illustrated associations of clinical and genomic parameters with treatment efficacy, and the efficacy of novel antibody–drug conjugates was explored in preclinical TNBC models of subtypes for which treatment was futile. In general, the FUTURE strategy recruits patients efficiently and provides promising efficacy with manageable toxicities, outlining a direction for further clinical exploration.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00795-2"

"cr","Tuning charge density of chimeric antigen receptor optimizes tonic signaling and CAR-T cell fitness","Tonic signaling of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), i.e., the spontaneous CAR activation in the absence of tumor antigen stimulation, is considered to be a pivotal event controlling CAR-T efficacy. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the spontaneous CAR signals remains elusive. Here, we unveil that positively charged patches (PCPs) on the surface of the CAR antigen-binding domain mediate CAR clustering and result in CAR tonic signaling. For CARs with high tonic signaling (e.g., GD2.CAR and CSPG4.CAR), reducing PCPs on CARs or boosting ionic strength in the culture medium during ex vivo CAR-T cell expansion minimizes spontaneous CAR activation and alleviates CAR-T cell exhaustion. In contrast, introducing PCPs into the CAR with weak tonic signaling, such as CD19.CAR, results in improved in vivo persistence and superior antitumor function. These results demonstrate that CAR tonic signaling is induced and maintained by PCP-mediated CAR clustering. Notably, the mutations we generated to alter the PCPs maintain the antigen-binding affinity and specificity of the CAR. Therefore, our findings suggest that the rational tuning of PCPs to optimize tonic signaling and in vivo fitness of CAR-T cells is a promising design strategy for the next-generation CAR.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00789-0"

"cr","Mechanism of activation and biased signaling in complement receptor C5aR1","The complement system plays an important role in the innate immune response to invading pathogens. The complement fragment C5a is one of its important effector components and exerts diverse physiological functions through activation of the C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) and associated downstream G protein and β-arrestin signaling pathways. Dysfunction of the C5a-C5aR1 axis is linked to numerous inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases, but the structural basis for activation and biased signaling of C5aR1 remains elusive. Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of the activated wild-type C5aR1–Gi protein complex bound to each of the following: C5a, the hexapeptidic agonist C5apep, and the G protein-biased agonist BM213. The structures reveal the landscape of the C5a–C5aR1 interaction as well as a common motif for the recognition of diverse orthosteric ligands. Moreover, combined with mutagenesis studies and cell-based pharmacological assays, we deciphered a framework for biased signaling using different peptide analogs and provided insight into the activation mechanism of C5aR1 by solving the structure of C5aR1I116A mutant–Gi signaling activation complex induced by C089, which exerts antagonism on wild-type C5aR1. In addition, unusual conformational changes in the intracellular end of transmembrane domain 7 and helix 8 upon agonist binding suggest a differential signal transduction process. Collectively, our study provides mechanistic understanding into the ligand recognition, biased signaling modulation, activation, and Gi protein coupling of C5aR1, which may facilitate the future design of therapeutic agents.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00779-2"
"cr","Human IFT-A complex structures provide molecular insights into ciliary transport","Intraflagellar transport (IFT) complexes, IFT-A and IFT-B, form bidirectional trains that move along the axonemal microtubules and are essential for assembling and maintaining cilia. Mutations in IFT subunits lead to numerous ciliopathies involving multiple tissues. However, how IFT complexes assemble and mediate cargo transport lacks mechanistic understanding due to missing high-resolution structural information of the holo-complexes. Here we report cryo-EM structures of human IFT-A complexes in the presence and absence of TULP3 at overall resolutions of 3.0–3.9 Å. IFT-A adopts a “lariat” shape with interconnected core and peripheral subunits linked by structurally vital zinc-binding domains. TULP3, the cargo adapter, interacts with IFT-A through its N-terminal region, and interface mutations disrupt cargo transport. We also determine the molecular impacts of disease mutations on complex formation and ciliary transport. Our work reveals IFT-A architecture, sheds light on ciliary transport and IFT train formation, and enables the rationalization of disease mutations in ciliopathies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-023-00778-3"
"cr","Human endoderm stem cells reverse inflammation-related acute liver failure through cystatin SN-mediated inhibition of interferon signaling","Acute liver failure (ALF) is a life-threatening disease that occurs secondary to drug toxicity, infection or a devastating immune response. Orthotopic liver transplantation is an effective treatment but limited by the shortage of donor organs, the requirement for life-long immune suppression and surgical challenges. Stem cell transplantation is a promising alternative therapy for fulminant liver failure owing to the immunomodulatory abilities of stem cells. Here, we report that when transplanted into the liver, human endoderm stem cells (hEnSCs) that are germ layer-specific and nontumorigenic cells derived from pluripotent stem cells are able to effectively ameliorate hepatic injury in multiple rodent and swine drug-induced ALF models. We demonstrate that hEnSCs tune the local immune microenvironment by skewing macrophages/Kupffer cells towards an anti-inflammatory state and by reducing the infiltrating monocytes/macrophages and inflammatory T helper cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of infiltrating and resident monocytes/macrophages isolated from animal livers revealed dramatic changes, including changes in gene expression that correlated with the change of activation states, and dynamic population heterogeneity among these cells after hEnSC transplantation. We further demonstrate that hEnSCs modulate the activation state of macrophages/Kupffer cells via cystatin SN (CST1)-mediated inhibition of interferon signaling and therefore highlight CST1 as a candidate therapeutic agent for diseases that involve over-activation of interferons. We propose that hEnSC transplantation represents a novel and powerful cell therapeutic treatment for ALF.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00760-5"
"cr","Targeting ATAD3A-PINK1-mitophagy axis overcomes chemoimmunotherapy resistance by redirecting PD-L1 to mitochondria","Only a small proportion of patients with triple-negative breast cancer benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) targeting PD-1/PD-L1 signaling in combination with chemotherapy. Here, we discovered that therapeutic response to ICI plus paclitaxel was associated with subcellular redistribution of PD-L1. In our immunotherapy cohort of ICI in combination with nab-paclitaxel, tumor samples from responders showed significant distribution of PD-L1 at mitochondria, while non-responders showed increased accumulation of PD-L1 on tumor cell membrane instead of mitochondria. Our results also revealed that the distribution pattern of PD-L1 was regulated by an ATAD3A-PINK1 axis. Mechanistically, PINK1 recruited PD-L1 to mitochondria for degradation via a mitophagy pathway. Importantly, paclitaxel increased ATAD3A expression to disrupt proteostasis of PD-L1 by restraining PINK1-dependent mitophagy. Clinically, patients with tumors exhibiting high expression of ATAD3A detected before the treatment with ICI in combination with paclitaxel had markedly shorter progression-free survival compared with those with ATAD3A-low tumors. Preclinical results further demonstrated that targeting ATAD3A reset a favorable antitumor immune microenvironment and increased the efficacy of combination therapy of ICI plus paclitaxel. In summary, our results indicate that ATAD3A serves not only as a resistant factor for the combination therapy of ICI plus paclitaxel through preventing PD-L1 mitochondrial distribution, but also as a promising target for increasing the therapeutic responses to chemoimmunotherapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00766-z"
"cr","RBP–RNA interactions in the control of autoimmunity and autoinflammation","Autoimmunity and autoinflammation arise from aberrant immunological and inflammatory responses toward self-components, contributing to various autoimmune diseases and autoinflammatory diseases. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential for immune cell development and function, mainly via exerting post-transcriptional regulation of RNA metabolism and function. Functional dysregulation of RBPs and abnormities in RNA metabolism are closely associated with multiple autoimmune or autoinflammatory disorders. Distinct RBPs play critical roles in aberrant autoreactive inflammatory responses via orchestrating a complex regulatory network consisting of DNAs, RNAs and proteins within immune cells. In-depth characterizations of RBP–RNA interactomes during autoimmunity and autoinflammation will lead to a better understanding of autoimmune pathogenesis and facilitate the development of effective therapeutic strategies. In this review, we summarize and discuss the functions of RBP–RNA interactions in controlling aberrant autoimmune inflammation and their potential as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00752-5"
"cr","RALF signaling pathway activates MLO calcium channels to maintain pollen tube integrity","Pollen tube tip growth requires intricate Ca2+ signaling. Recent studies have also identified rapid alkalization factor (RALF)-family peptides and their receptors as critical components for pollen tube tip growth and integrity. The functional relationship of RALF and calcium signaling modules remains largely unclear. Here we report that disruption of RALF signaling pathway abolished the cytosolic Ca2+ gradient in the pollen tube, indicating that Ca2+ signaling is downstream of the RALF signaling pathway. We identified MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O (MLO) family proteins MLO1, 5, 9, 15, as Ca2+ channels required for Ca2+ influx and pollen tube integrity. We further reconstituted the biochemical pathway in which signaling via RALF and RALF receptors activated MLO1/5/9/15 calcium channels. Together, we conclude that RALF peptides derived from pollen tube bind to their receptors to establish pollen tube Ca2+ gradient through activation of the MLO channels. Our finding has thus provided a mechanistic link between the RALF signaling pathway and Ca2+ signaling in controlling pollen tube integrity and growth.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00754-3"

This calls for the variant-proof SARS-CoV-2 vaccines targeting the more conserved regions in S protein. Here, we designed a recombinant subunit vaccine, HR121, targeting the conserved HR1 domain in S2 subunit of S protein. HR121 consisting of HR1–linker1–HR2–linker2–HR1, is conformationally and functionally analogous to the HR1 domain present in the fusion intermediate conformation of S2 subunit. Immunization with HR121 in rabbits and rhesus macaques elicited highly potent cross-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, particularly Omicron sublineages. Vaccination with HR121 achieved near-full protections against prototype SARS-CoV-2 infection in hACE2 transgenic mice, Syrian golden hamsters and rhesus macaques, and effective protection against Omicron BA.2 infection in Syrian golden hamsters. This study demonstrates that HR121 is a promising candidate of variant-proof SARS-CoV-2 vaccine with a novel conserved target in the S2 subunit for application against current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00746-3"

"cr","Integrated proteogenomic characterization across major histological types of pituitary neuroendocrine tumors","Pituitary neuroendocrine tumor (PitNET) is one of the most common intracranial tumors. Due to its extensive tumor heterogeneity and the lack of high-quality tissues for biomarker discovery, the causative molecular mechanisms are far from being fully defined. Therefore, more studies are needed to improve the current clinicopathological classification system, and advanced treatment strategies such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy are yet to be explored. Here, we performed the largest integrative genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and phosphoproteomics analysis reported to date for a cohort of 200 PitNET patients. Genomics data indicate that GNAS copy number gain can serve as a reliable diagnostic marker for hyperproliferation of the PIT1 lineage. Proteomics-based classification of PitNETs identified 7 clusters, among which, tumors overexpressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers clustered into a more invasive subgroup. Further analysis identified potential therapeutic targets, including CDK6, TWIST1, EGFR, and VEGFR2, for different clusters. Immune subtyping to explore the potential for application of immunotherapy in PitNET identified an association between alterations in the JAK1-STAT1-PDL1 axis and immune exhaustion, and between changes in the JAK3-STAT6-FOS/JUN axis and immune infiltration. These identified molecular markers and alternations in various clusters/subtypes were further confirmed in an independent cohort of 750 PitNET patients. This proteogenomic analysis across traditional histological boundaries improves our current understanding of PitNET pathophysiology and suggests novel therapeutic targets and strategies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00736-5"
"cr","Targeting UHRF1-SAP30-MXD4 axis for leukemia initiating cell eradication in myeloid leukemia","Aberrant self-renewal of leukemia initiation cells (LICs) drives aggressive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we report that UHRF1, an epigenetic regulator that recruits DNMT1 to methylate DNA, is highly expressed in AML and predicts poor prognosis. UHRF1 is required for myeloid leukemogenesis by maintaining self-renewal of LICs. Mechanistically, UHRF1 directly interacts with Sin3A-associated protein 30 (SAP30) through two critical amino acids, G572 and F573 in its SRA domain, to repress gene expression. Depletion of UHRF1 or SAP30 derepresses an important target gene, MXD4, which encodes a MYC antagonist, and leads to suppression of leukemogenesis. Further knockdown of MXD4 can rescue the leukemogenesis by activating the MYC pathway. Lastly, we identified a UHRF1 inhibitor, UF146, and demonstrated its significant therapeutic efficacy in the myeloid leukemia PDX model. Taken together, our study reveals the mechanisms for altered epigenetic programs in AML and provides a promising targeted therapeutic strategy against AML.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00735-6"
"cr","Intercellular transfer of activated STING triggered by RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagy promotes antitumor immunity","STING, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) transmembrane protein, mediates innate immune activation upon cGAMP stimulation and is degraded through autophagy. Here, we report that activated STING could be transferred between cells to promote antitumor immunity, a process triggered by RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagy. Mechanistically, RAB22A engages PI4K2A to generate PI4P that recruits the Atg12–Atg5–Atg16L1 complex, inducing the formation of ER-derived RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagosome, in which STING activated by agonists or chemoradiotherapy is packaged. This RAB22A-induced autophagosome fuses with RAB22A-positive early endosome, generating a new organelle that we name Rafeesome (RAB22A-mediated non-canonical autophagosome fused with early endosome). Meanwhile, RAB22A inactivates RAB7 to suppress the fusion of Rafeesome with lysosome, thereby enabling the secretion of the inner vesicle of the autophagosome bearing activated STING as a new type of extracellular vesicle that we define as R-EV (RAB22A-induced extracellular vesicle). Activated STING-containing R-EVs induce IFNβ release from recipient cells to the tumor microenvironment, promoting antitumor immunity. Consistently, RAB22A enhances the antitumor effect of the STING agonist diABZI in mice, and a high RAB22A level predicts good survival in nasopharyngeal cancer patients treated with chemoradiotherapy. Our findings reveal that Rafeesome regulates the intercellular transfer of activated STING to trigger and spread antitumor immunity, and that the inner vesicle of non-canonical autophagosome originated from ER is secreted as R-EV, providing a new perspective for understanding the intercellular communication of organelle membrane proteins.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00731-w"
"cr","A novel protein RASON encoded by a lncRNA controls oncogenic RAS signaling in KRAS mutant cancers","Mutations of the RAS oncogene are found in around 30% of all human cancers yet direct targeting of RAS is still considered clinically impractical except for the KRASG12C mutant. Here we report that RAS-ON (RASON), a novel protein encoded by the long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 00673 (LINC00673), is a positive regulator of oncogenic RAS signaling. RASON is aberrantly overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients, and it promotes proliferation of human PDAC cell lines in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of Rason in mouse embryonic fibroblasts inhibits KRAS-mediated tumor transformation. Genetic deletion of Rason abolishes oncogenic KRAS-driven pancreatic and lung cancer tumorigenesis in LSL-KrasG12D; Trp53R172H/+ mice. Mechanistically, RASON directly binds to KRASG12D/V and inhibits both intrinsic and GTPase activating protein (GAP)-mediated GTP hydrolysis, thus sustaining KRASG12D/V in the GTP-bound hyperactive state. Therapeutically, deprivation of RASON sensitizes KRAS mutant pancreatic cancer cells and patient-derived organoids to EGFR inhibitors. Our findings identify RASON as a critical regulator of oncogenic KRAS signaling and a promising therapeutic target for KRAS mutant cancers.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00726-7"

To address this knowledge gap, we probed chromatin accessibility at single-cell resolution in the brains, hearts, skeletal muscles, and bone marrows from young, middle-aged, and old mice, and assessed age-associated changes at 353,126 candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) across 32 major cell types. Unexpectedly, we detected increased chromatin accessibility within specific heterochromatin domains in old mouse excitatory neurons. The gain of chromatin accessibility at these genomic loci was accompanied by the cell-type-specific loss of heterochromatin and activation of LINE1 elements. Immunostaining further confirmed the loss of the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 in the excitatory neurons but not in inhibitory neurons or glial cells. Our results reveal the cell-type-specific changes in chromatin landscapes in old mice and shed light on the scope of heterochromatin loss in mammalian aging.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00719-6"

The m6A “writer” consists of the catalytic subunit m6A-METTL complex (MAC) and the regulatory subunit m6A-METTL-associated complex (MACOM), the latter being essential for enzymatic activity. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of MACOM at a 3.0-Å resolution, uncovering that WTAP and VIRMA form the core structure of MACOM and that ZC3H13 stretches the conformation by binding VIRMA. Furthermore, the 4.4-Å resolution cryo-EM map of the MACOM–MAC complex, combined with crosslinking mass spectrometry and GST pull-down analysis, elucidates a plausible model of the m6A writer complex, in which MACOM binds to MAC mainly through WTAP and METTL3 interactions. In combination with in vitro RNA substrate binding and m6A methyltransferase activity assays, our results illustrate the molecular basis of how MACOM assembles and interacts with MAC to form an active m6A writer complex.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00725-8"
"cr","CRISPR FISHer enables high-sensitivity imaging of nonrepetitive DNA in living cells through phase separation-mediated signal amplification","The dynamic three-dimensional structures of chromatin and extrachromosomal DNA molecules regulate fundamental cellular processes and beyond. However, the visualization of specific DNA sequences in live cells, especially nonrepetitive sequences accounting for most of the genome, is still vastly challenging. Here, we introduce a robust CRISPR-mediated fluorescence in situ hybridization amplifier (CRISPR FISHer) system, which exploits engineered sgRNA and protein trimerization domain-mediated, phase separation-based exponential assembly of fluorescent proteins in the CRISPR-targeting locus, conferring enhancements in both local brightness and signal-to-background ratio and thus achieving single sgRNA-directed visualization of native nonrepetitive DNA loci in live cells. In one application, by labeling and tracking the broken ends of chromosomal fragments, CRISPR FISHer enables real-time visualization of the entire process of chromosome breakage, separation, and subsequent intra- or inter-chromosomal ends rejoining in a single live cell. Furthermore, CRISPR FISHer allows the movement of small extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) and invading DNAs to be recorded, revealing substantial differences in dynamic behaviors between chromosomal and extrachromosomal loci. With the potential to track any specified self or non-self DNA sequences, CRISPR FISHer dramatically broadens the scope of live-cell imaging in biological events and for biomedical diagnoses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00712-z"

The development of broad-spectrum antivirals is thus urgently needed. We previously developed two hetero-bivalent nanobodies (Nbs), aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7, with potent neutralization activity against the wild-type (WT) Wuhan isolated SARS-CoV-2, by fusing aRBD-2 with aRBD-5 and aRBD-7, respectively. Here, we resolved the crystal structures of these Nbs in complex with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein, and found that aRBD-2 contacts with highly-conserved RBD residues and retains binding to the RBD of the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Delta plus, Kappa, Lambda, Omicron BA.1, and BA.2 variants. In contrast, aRBD-5 and aRBD-7 bind to less-conserved RBD epitopes non-overlapping with the epitope of aRBD-2, and do not show apparent binding to the RBD of some variants. However, when fused with aRBD-2, they effectively enhance the overall binding affinity. Consistently, aRBD-2-5-Fc and aRBD-2-7-Fc potently neutralized all of the tested authentic or pseudotyped viruses, including WT, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1 and BA.2. Furthermore, aRBD-2-5-Fc provided prophylactic protection against the WT and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 in mice, and conferred protection against the Omicron BA.1 variant in hamsters prophylactically and therapeutically, indicating that aRBD-2-5-Fc could potentially benefit the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 caused by the emerging variants of concern. Our strategy provides new solutions in the development of broad-spectrum therapeutic antibodies for COVID-19.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00700-3"
"cr","Glutamate drives ‘local Ca2+ release’ in cardiac pacemaker cells","The sinoatrial node (SAN) is the origin of the electrical signals for rhythmic heartbeats in mammals. The spontaneous firing of SAN pacemaker cells (SANPCs) triggers cardiac contraction. ‘Local Ca2+ release’ (LCR), a unique cellular activity, acts as the ‘engine’ of the spontaneous firing of SANPCs. However, the mechanism of LCR initiation remains unclear. Here, we report that endogenous glutamate drives LCRs in SANPCs. Using a glutamate sensor, we unraveled a tight correlation between glutamate accumulation and LCR occurrence, indicating a potential relationship between glutamate and LCRs. Intracellular application of glutamate significantly enhanced the LCRs in both intact and permeabilized SANPCs. Mechanistically, we revealed that mitochondrial excitatory amino acid transporter 1 (EAAT1)-dependent mitochondrial glutamate import promoted ROS generation, which in turn led to the oxidation of Ca2+-handling proteins, ultimately resulting in enhanced LCRs. Importantly, EAAT1 depletion reduced both the spontaneous firing rates of isolated SANPCs and the heart rate in vitro and in vivo, suggesting the central role of EAAT1 as a glutamate transporter in the regulation of cardiac autonomic rhythm. In conclusion, our results indicate that glutamate serves as an LCR igniter in SANPCs, adding a potentially important element to the coupled-clock theory that explains the origin of spontaneous firing. These findings shed new light on the future prevention and treatment of cardiac pacemaker cell-related arrhythmias.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00693-z"

"cr","A novel lineage of osteoprogenitor cells with dual epithelial and mesenchymal properties govern maxillofacial bone homeostasis and regeneration after MSFL","Bone regeneration originates from proliferation and differentiation of osteoprogenitors via either endochondral or intramembranous ossification; and the regeneration capacities decline with age and estrogen loss. Maxillary sinus floor lifting (MSFL) is a commonly used surgical procedure for guiding bone regeneration in maxilla. Radiographic analysis of 1210 clinical cases of maxilla bone regeneration after MSFL revealed that the intrasinus osteogenic efficacy was independent of age and gender, however; and this might be related to the Schneiderian membrane that lines the sinus cavity. In view of the particularity of this biological process, our present study aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of MSFL-induced bone regeneration. We first established a murine model to simulate the clinical MSFL. By single-cell RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry-based bulk RNA-sequencing, we identified a novel Krt14+Ctsk+ subset of cells that display both epithelial and mesenchymal properties and the transcriptomic feature of osteoprogenitors. Dual recombinases-mediated lineage tracing and loss-of-function analyses showed that these Krt14+Ctsk+ progenitors contribute to both MSFL-induced osteogenesis and physiological bone homeostasis by differentiating into Krt14–Ctsk+ descendants which show robust osteogenic capacity. In addition, we detected a similar population of Krt14+Ctsk+ cells in human samples of Schneiderian membrane, which show a highly similar osteogenic potential and transcriptomic feature to the corresponding cells in mice. The identification of this Krt14+Ctsk+ population, featured by osteoprogenitor characteristics and dual epithelial–mesenchymal properties, provides new insight into the understanding of bone regeneration and may open more possibilities for clinical applications.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00687-x"

Using de novo long-read assembly, we generated a graph-based super pan-genome of rice consisting of a 251-accession panel comprising both cultivated and wild species of Asian and African rice. Our pan-genome reveals extensive structural variations (SVs) and gene presence/absence variations. Additionally, our pan-genome enables the accurate identification of nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat genes and characterization of their inter- and intraspecific diversity. Moreover, we uncovered grain weight-associated SVs which specify traits by affecting the expression of their nearby genes. We characterized genetic variants associated with submergence tolerance, seed shattering and plant architecture and found independent selection for a common set of genes that drove adaptation and domestication in Asian and African rice. This super pan-genome facilitates pinpointing of lineage-specific haplotypes for trait-associated genes and provides insights into the evolutionary events that have shaped the genomic architecture of various rice species.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00685-z"

Despite great progress made in therapeutic development against this diverse receptor family, drugs that target SSTRs still show limited efficacy with preferential binding affinity and conspicuous side-effects. Here, we report five structures of SSTR2 and SSTR4 in different states, including two crystal structures of SSTR2 in complex with a selective peptide antagonist and a non-peptide agonist, respectively, a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Gi1-bound SSTR2 in the presence of the endogenous ligand SST-14, as well as two cryo-EM structures of Gi1-bound SSTR4 in complex with SST-14 and a small-molecule agonist J-2156, respectively. By comparison of the SSTR structures in different states, molecular mechanisms of agonism and antagonism were illustrated. Together with computational and functional analyses, the key determinants responsible for ligand recognition and selectivity of different SSTR subtypes and multiform binding modes of peptide and non-peptide ligands were identified. Insights gained in this study will help uncover ligand selectivity of various SSTRs and accelerate the development of new molecules with better efficacy by targeting SSTRs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00679-x"

"cr","Structural and biochemical mechanism for increased infectivity and immune evasion of Omicron BA.2 variant compared to BA.1 and their possible mouse origins","The Omicron BA.2 variant has become a dominant infective strain worldwide. Receptor binding studies show that the Omicron BA.2 spike trimer exhibits 11-fold and 2-fold higher potency in binding to human ACE2 than the spike trimer from the wildtype (WT) and Omicron BA.1 strains. The structure of the BA.2 spike trimer complexed with human ACE2 reveals that all three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) in the spike trimer are in open conformation, ready for ACE2 binding, thus providing a basis for the increased infectivity of the BA.2 strain. JMB2002, a therapeutic antibody that was shown to efficiently inhibit Omicron BA.1, also shows potent neutralization activities against Omicron BA.2. In addition, both BA.1 and BA.2 spike trimers are able to bind to mouse ACE2 with high potency. In contrast, the WT spike trimer binds well to cat ACE2 but not to mouse ACE2. The structures of both BA.1 and BA.2 spike trimer bound to mouse ACE2 reveal the basis for their high affinity interactions. Together, these results suggest a possible evolution pathway for Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants via a human-cat-mouse-human circle, which could have important implications in establishing an effective strategy for combating SARS-CoV-2 viral infections.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00672-4"

TPS cells shared features with 2-cell mouse embryos in terms of totipotency markers, transcriptome, chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation patterns. In vivo chimera formation assays show that these cells have embryonic and extraembryonic developmental potentials at the single-cell level. Moreover, TPS cells can be induced into blastocyst-like structures resembling preimplantation mouse blastocysts. Mechanistically, inhibition of HDAC1/2 and DOT1L activity and activation of RARγ signaling are important for inducing and maintaining totipotent features of TPS cells.

However, the underlying mechanisms of chromatin remodeling remain to be explored. Here, we investigated the dynamic changes in nucleosome occupancy and positioning in pronucleus-stage zygotes using ultra low-input MNase-seq. We observed distinct features of inheritance and reconstruction of nucleosome positioning in both paternal and maternal genomes. Genome-wide de novo nucleosome occupancy in the paternal genome was observed as early as 1 h after the injection of sperm into ooplasm. The nucleosome positioning pattern was continually rebuilt to form nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) at promoters and transcription factor (TF) binding sites with differential dynamics in paternal and maternal genomes. NDRs formed more quickly on the promoters of genes involved in zygotic genome activation (ZGA), and this formation is closely linked to histone acetylation, but not transcription elongation or DNA replication. Importantly, we found that NDR establishment on the binding motifs of specific TFs might be associated with their potential pioneer functions in ZGA. Further investigations suggested that the predicted factors MLX and RFX1 played important roles in regulating minor and major ZGA, respectively. Our data not only elucidate the nucleosome positioning dynamics in both male and female pronuclei following fertilization, but also provide an efficient method for identifying key transcription regulators during development.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00652-8"

In each IR monomer, the Z-shaped Nup188–Nup192 complex in the middle layer is sandwiched by two approximately parallel rhomboidal structures in the inner and outer layers, while Nup188, Nup192 and Nic96 link all subunits to constitute a relatively stable IR monomer.

Here, we show that the MLV-CLN network contributes to RT efficacy in brain tumors and mediates the RT-modulated anti-tumor immunity that is enhanced by vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C). Meningeal lymphatic dysfunction impaired tumor-derived dendritic cell (DC) trafficking and CD8+ T cell activation after RT, whereas tumors overexpressing VEGF-C with meningeal lymphatic expansion were highly sensitive to RT. Mechanistically, VEGF-C-driven modulation of RT-triggered anti-tumor immunity was attributed to C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 21 (CCL21)-dependent DC trafficking and CD8+ T cell activation. Notably, delivery of VEGF-C mRNA significantly enhanced RT efficacy and anti-tumor immunity in brain tumors. These findings suggest an essential role of the MLV-CLN network in RT-triggered anti-tumor immunity, and highlight the potential of VEGF-C mRNA for brain tumor therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00639-5"

We identified regional and temporal diversity among progenitor cells which give rise to a variety of interneurons. These cells are specified within the primate GEs by well conserved gene regulatory networks, similar to those identified in mice. However, we detected, in human, several novel regulatory pathways or factors involved in the specification and migration of interneurons. Importantly, comparison of progenitors between our human and published mouse GE datasets led to the discovery and confirmation of outer radial glial cells in GEs in human cortex.

However, this potential is severely limited by the time-consuming process of developing effective antibodies and the relative high cost of manufacturing. Herein, we present a rapid and cost-effective lipid nanoparticle (LNP) encapsulated-mRNA platform for in vivo delivery of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization antibodies. Two mRNAs encoding the light and heavy chains of a potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody HB27, which is currently being evaluated in clinical trials, were encapsulated into clinical grade LNP formulations (named as mRNA-HB27-LNP). In vivo characterization demonstrated that intravenous administration of mRNA-HB27-LNP in mice resulted in a longer circulating half-life compared with the original HB27 antibody in protein format. More importantly, a single prophylactic administration of mRNA-HB27-LNP provided protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in mice at 1, 7 and even 63 days post administration. In a close contact transmission model, prophylactic administration of mRNA-HB27-LNP prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection between hamsters in a dose-dependent manner.

Here we present single-particle cryo-EM structure of the nuclear ring (NR) subunit from Xenopus laevis NPC at an average resolution of 5.6 Å. The NR subunit comprises two 10-membered Y complexes, each with the nucleoporin ELYS closely associating with Nup160 and Nup37 of the long arm. Unlike the cytoplasmic ring (CR) or inner ring (IR), the NR subunit contains only one molecule each of Nup205 and Nup93. Nup205 binds both arms of the Y complexes and interacts with the stem of inner Y complex from the neighboring subunit. Nup93 connects the stems of inner and outer Y complexes within the same NR subunit, and places its N-terminal extended helix into the axial groove of Nup205 from the neighboring subunit. Together with other structural information, we have generated a composite atomic model of the central ring scaffold that includes the NR, IR, and CR. The IR is connected to the two outer rings mainly through Nup155. This model facilitates functional understanding of vertebrate NPC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00610-w"

Mbns are produced via modification of MbnA precursor peptides at cysteine residues catalyzed by the core biosynthetic machinery containing MbnB, an iron-dependent enzyme, and MbnC. However, mechanistic details underlying the catalysis of the MbnBC holoenzyme remain unclear. Here, we present crystal structures of MbnABC complexes from two distinct species, revealing that the leader peptide of the substrate MbnA binds MbnC for recruitment of the MbnBC holoenzyme, while the core peptide of MbnA resides in the catalytic cavity created by the MbnB–MbnC interaction which harbors a unique tri-iron cluster. Ligation of the substrate sulfhydryl group to the tri-iron center achieves a dioxygen-dependent reaction for oxazolone-thioamide installation. Structural analysis of the MbnABC complexes together with functional investigation of MbnB variants identified a conserved catalytic aspartate residue as a general base required for MbnBC-mediated MbnA modification. Together, our study reveals the similar architecture and function of MbnBC complexes from different species, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved catalytic mechanism of the MbnBC holoenzymes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00620-2"
"cr","Comprehensive metabolomics expands precision medicine for triple-negative breast cancer","Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer. However, systematic characterizations of metabolites in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are still lacking. Our study profiled the polar metabolome and lipidome in 330 TNBC samples and 149 paired normal breast tissues to construct a large metabolomic atlas of TNBC. Combining with previously established transcriptomic and genomic data of the same cohort, we conducted a comprehensive analysis linking TNBC metabolome to genomics. Our study classified TNBCs into three distinct metabolomic subgroups: C1, characterized by the enrichment of ceramides and fatty acids; C2, featured with the upregulation of metabolites related to oxidation reaction and glycosyl transfer; and C3, having the lowest level of metabolic dysregulation. Based on this newly developed metabolomic dataset, we refined previous TNBC transcriptomic subtypes and identified some crucial subtype-specific metabolites as potential therapeutic targets. The transcriptomic luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype overlapped with metabolomic C1 subtype. Experiments on patient-derived organoid and xenograft models indicate that targeting sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), an intermediate of the ceramide pathway, is a promising therapy for LAR tumors. Moreover, the transcriptomic basal-like immune-suppressed (BLIS) subtype contained two prognostic metabolomic subgroups (C2 and C3), which could be distinguished through machine-learning methods. We show that N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate is a crucial tumor-promoting metabolite and potential therapeutic target for high-risk BLIS tumors. Together, our study reveals the clinical significance of TNBC metabolomics, which can not only optimize the transcriptomic subtyping system, but also suggest novel therapeutic targets. This metabolomic dataset can serve as a useful public resource to promote precision treatment of TNBC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00614-0"
"cr","Heterogeneity in endothelial cells and widespread venous arterialization during early vascular development in mammals","Arteriogenesis rather than unspecialized capillary expansion is critical for restoring effective circulation to compromised tissues in patients. Deciphering the origin and specification of arterial endothelial cells during embryonic development will shed light on the understanding of adult arteriogenesis. However, during early embryonic angiogenesis, the process of endothelial diversification and molecular events underlying arteriovenous fate settling remain largely unresolved in mammals. Here, we constructed the single-cell transcriptomic landscape of vascular endothelial cells (VECs) during the time window for the occurrence of key vasculogenic and angiogenic events in both mouse and human embryos. We uncovered two distinct arterial VEC types, the major artery VECs and arterial plexus VECs, and unexpectedly divergent arteriovenous characteristics among VECs that are located in morphologically undistinguishable vascular plexus intra-embryonically. Using computational prediction and further lineage tracing of venous-featured VECs with a newly developed Nr2f2CrexER mouse model and a dual recombinase-mediated intersectional genetic approach, we revealed early and widespread arterialization from the capillaries with considerable venous characteristics. Altogether, our findings provide unprecedented and comprehensive details of endothelial heterogeneity and lineage relationships at early angiogenesis stages, and establish a new model regarding the arteriogenesis behaviors of early intra-embryonic vasculatures.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00615-z"

Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins are members of multiprotein complexes that are highly conserved throughout evolution. Historically, they have been described as essential for maintaining epigenetic cellular memory by locking homeotic genes in a transcriptionally repressed state. What was initially thought to be a function restricted to a few target genes, subsequently turned out to be of much broader relevance, since the main role of PcG complexes is to ensure a dynamically choregraphed spatio-temporal regulation of their numerous target genes during development. Their ability to modify chromatin landscapes and refine the expression of master genes controlling major switches in cellular decisions under physiological conditions is often misregulated in tumors. Surprisingly, their functional implication in the initiation and progression of cancer may be either dependent on Polycomb complexes, or specific for a subunit that acts independently of other PcG members. In this review, we describe how misregulated Polycomb proteins play a pleiotropic role in cancer by altering a broad spectrum of biological processes such as the proliferation-differentiation balance, metabolism and the immune response, all of which are crucial in tumor progression. We also illustrate how interfering with PcG functions can provide a powerful strategy to counter tumor progression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00606-6"
"cr","A novel STING agonist-adjuvanted pan-sarbecovirus vaccine elicits potent and durable neutralizing antibody and T cell responses in mice, rabbits and NHPs","The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and potentially other highly pathogenic sarbecoviruses in the future highlights the need for pan-sarbecovirus vaccines. Here, we discovered a new STING agonist, CF501, and found that CF501-adjuvanted RBD-Fc vaccine (CF501/RBD-Fc) elicited significantly stronger neutralizing antibody (nAb) and T cell responses than Alum- and cGAMP-adjuvanted RBD-Fc in mice. Vaccination of rabbits and rhesus macaques (nonhuman primates, NHPs) with CF501/RBD-Fc elicited exceptionally potent nAb responses against SARS-CoV-2 and its nine variants and 41 S-mutants, SARS-CoV and bat SARSr-CoVs. CF501/RBD-Fc-immunized hACE2-transgenic mice were almost completely protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge, even 6 months after the initial immunization. NHPs immunized with a single dose of CF501/RBD-Fc produced high titers of nAbs. The immunized macaques also exhibited durable humoral and cellular immune responses and showed remarkably reduced viral load in the upper and lower airways upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge even at 108 days post the final immunization. Thus, CF501/RBD-Fc can be further developed as a novel pan-sarbecovirus vaccine to combat current and future outbreaks of sarbecovirus diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-022-00612-2"

Despite ongoing attempts since the 1990s, no stably defined pig epiblast-derived stem cell line has been established. Here, guided by insights from a large-scale single-cell transcriptome analysis of pig embryos from embryonic day (E) 0 to E14, specifically, the tracing of pluripotency changes during epiblast development, we developed an in vitro culture medium for establishing and maintaining stable pluripotent stem cell lines from pig E10 pregastrulation epiblasts (pgEpiSCs). Enabled by chemical inhibition of WNT-related signaling in combination with growth factors in the FGF/ERK, JAK/STAT3, and Activin/Nodal pathways, pgEpiSCs maintain their pluripotency transcriptome features, similar to those of E10 epiblast cells, and normal karyotypes after more than 240 passages and have the potential to differentiate into three germ layers. Strikingly, ultradeep in situ Hi-C analysis revealed functional impacts of chromatin 3D-spatial associations on the transcriptional regulation of pluripotency marker genes in pgEpiSCs. In practice, we confirmed that pgEpiSCs readily tolerate at least three rounds of successive gene editing and generated cloned gene-edited live piglets. Our findings deliver on the long-anticipated promise of pig pluripotent stem cells and open new avenues for biological research, animal husbandry, and regenerative biomedicine.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00592-9"
"cr","A distinct D1-MSN subpopulation down-regulates dopamine to promote negative emotional state","Dopamine (DA) level in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is critical for reward and aversion encoding. DA released from the ventral mesencephalon (VM) DAergic neurons increases the excitability of VM-projecting D1-dopamine receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) in the NAc to enhance DA release and augment rewards. However, how such a DA positive feedback loop is regulated to maintain DA homeostasis and reward-aversion balance remains elusive. Here we report that the ventral pallidum (VP) projection of NAc D1-MSNs (D1NAc-VP) is inhibited by rewarding stimuli and activated by aversive stimuli. In contrast to the VM projection of D1-MSN (D1NAc-VM), activation of D1NAc-VP projection induces aversion, but not reward. D1NAc-VP MSNs are distinct from the D1NAc-VM MSNs, which exhibit conventional functions of D1-MSNs. Activation of D1NAc-VP projection stimulates VM GABAergic transmission, inhibits VM DAergic neurons, and reduces DA release into the NAc. Thus, D1NAc-VP and D1NAc-VM MSNs cooperatively control NAc dopamine balance and reward-aversion states.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00588-5"

Transgenic mice overexpressing amyloid precursor protein (App) gene manifest non-physiological and ectopic expression of APP and its fragments in the brain, which is not observed in AD patients. The App knock-in mice circumvented some of these problems, but they do not exhibit tau pathology and neuronal death. We have generated a rat model, with three familiar App mutations and humanized Aβ sequence knocked into the rat App gene. Without altering the levels of full-length APP and other APP fragments, this model exhibits pathologies and disease progression resembling those in human patients: deposit of Aβ plaques in relevant brain regions, microglia activation and gliosis, progressive synaptic degeneration and AD-relevant cognitive deficits. Interestingly, we have observed tau pathology, neuronal apoptosis and necroptosis and brain atrophy, phenotypes rarely seen in other APP models. This App knock-in rat model may serve as a useful tool for AD research, identifying new drug targets and biomarkers, and testing therapeutics.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00582-x"
"cr","Zipper head mechanism of telomere synthesis by human telomerase","Telomerase, a multi-subunit ribonucleoprotein complex, is a unique reverse transcriptase that catalyzes the processive addition of a repeat sequence to extend the telomere end using a short fragment of its own RNA component as the template. Despite recent structural characterizations of human and Tetrahymena telomerase, it is still a mystery how telomerase repeatedly uses its RNA template to synthesize telomeric DNA. Here, we report the cryo-EM structure of human telomerase holoenzyme bound with telomeric DNA at resolutions of 3.5 Å and 3.9 Å for the catalytic core and biogenesis module, respectively. The structure reveals that a leucine residue Leu980 in telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) catalytic subunit functions as a zipper head to limit the length of the short primer–template duplex in the active center. Moreover, our structural and computational analyses suggest that TERT and telomerase RNA (hTR) are organized to harbor a preformed active site that can accommodate short primer–template duplex substrates for catalysis. Furthermore, our findings unveil a double-fingers architecture in TERT that ensures nucleotide addition processivity of human telomerase. We propose that the zipper head Leu980 is a structural determinant for the sequence-based pausing signal of DNA synthesis that coincides with the RNA element-based physical template boundary. Functional analyses unveil that the non-glycine zipper head plays an essential role in both telomerase repeat addition processivity and telomere length homeostasis. In addition, we also demonstrate that this zipper head mechanism is conserved in all eukaryotic telomerases. Together, our study provides an integrated model for telomerase-mediated telomere synthesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00586-7"
"cr","Comparison of viral RNA–host protein interactomes across pathogenic RNA viruses informs rapid antiviral drug discovery for SARS-CoV-2","In contrast to the extensive research about viral protein–host protein interactions that has revealed major insights about how RNA viruses engage with host cells during infection, few studies have examined interactions between host factors and viral RNAs (vRNAs). Here, we profiled vRNA–host protein interactomes for three RNA virus pathogens (SARS-CoV-2, Zika, and Ebola viruses) using ChIRP-MS. Comparative interactome analyses discovered both common and virus-specific host responses and vRNA-associated proteins that variously promote or restrict viral infection. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 binds and hijacks the host factor IGF2BP1 to stabilize vRNA and augment viral translation. Our interactome-informed drug repurposing efforts identified several FDA-approved drugs (e.g., Cepharanthine) as broad-spectrum antivirals in cells and hACE2 transgenic mice. A co-treatment comprising Cepharanthine and Trifluoperazine was highly potent against the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 B.1.351 variant. Thus, our study illustrates the scientific and medical discovery utility of adopting a comparative vRNA–host protein interactome perspective.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00581-y"

We conducted a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled (29 patients/group) phase II clinical trial to validate previous findings and explore the potential mechanisms. Patients treated with umbilical cord-derived MSCs exhibited a shorter hospital stay (P = 0.0198) and less time required for symptoms remission (P = 0.0194) than those who received placebo. Based on chest images, both severe and critical patients treated with MSCs showed improvement by day 7 (P = 0.0099) and day 21 (P = 0.0084). MSC-treated patients had fewer adverse events. MSC infusion reduced the levels of C-reactive protein, proinflammatory cytokines, and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and promoted the maintenance of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. To explore how MSCs modulate the immune system, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on peripheral blood. Our analysis identified a novel subpopulation of VNN2+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor-like (HSPC-like) cells expressing CSF3R and PTPRE that were mobilized following MSC infusion. Genes encoding chemotaxis factors — CX3CR1 and L-selectin — were upregulated in various immune cells. MSC treatment also regulated B cell subsets and increased the expression of costimulatory CD28 in T cells in vivo and in vitro. In addition, an in vivo mouse study confirmed that MSCs suppressed NET release and reduced venous thrombosis by upregulating kindlin-3 signaling. Together, our results underscore the role of MSCs in improving COVID-19 patient outcomes via maintenance of immune homeostasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00573-y"
"cr","K2P18.1 translates T cell receptor signals into thymic regulatory T cell development","It remains largely unclear how thymocytes translate relative differences in T cell receptor (TCR) signal strength into distinct developmental programs that drive the cell fate decisions towards conventional (Tconv) or regulatory T cells (Treg). Following TCR activation, intracellular calcium (Ca2+) is the most important second messenger, for which the potassium channel K2P18.1 is a relevant regulator. Here, we identify K2P18.1 as a central translator of the TCR signal into the thymus-derived Treg (tTreg) selection process. TCR signal was coupled to NF-κB-mediated K2P18.1 upregulation in tTreg progenitors. K2P18.1 provided the driving force for sustained Ca2+ influx that facilitated NF-κB- and NFAT-dependent expression of FoxP3, the master transcription factor for Treg development and function. Loss of K2P18.1 ion-current function induced a mild lymphoproliferative phenotype in mice, with reduced Treg numbers that led to aggravated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, while a gain-of-function mutation in K2P18.1 resulted in increased Treg numbers in mice. Our findings in human thymus, recent thymic emigrants and multiple sclerosis patients with a dominant-negative missense K2P18.1 variant that is associated with poor clinical outcomes indicate that K2P18.1 also plays a role in human Treg development. Pharmacological modulation of K2P18.1 specifically modulated Treg numbers in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we identified nitroxoline as a K2P18.1 activator that led to rapid and reversible Treg increase in patients with urinary tract infections. Conclusively, our findings reveal how K2P18.1 translates TCR signals into thymic T cell fate decisions and Treg development, and provide a basis for the therapeutic utilization of Treg in several human disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00580-z"
"cr","SARS-CoV-2 promotes RIPK1 activation to facilitate viral propagation","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the ongoing global pandemic that poses substantial challenges to public health worldwide. A subset of COVID-19 patients experience systemic inflammatory response, known as cytokine storm, which may lead to death. Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is an important mediator of inflammation and cell death. Here, we examined the interaction of RIPK1-mediated innate immunity with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found evidence of RIPK1 activation in human COVID-19 lung pathological samples, and cultured human lung organoids and ACE2 transgenic mice infected by SARS-CoV-2. Inhibition of RIPK1 using multiple small-molecule inhibitors reduced the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in human lung organoids. Furthermore, therapeutic dosing of the RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1s reduced mortality and lung viral load, and blocked the CNS manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 in ACE2 transgenic mice. Mechanistically, we found that the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2, NSP12, a highly conserved central component of coronaviral replication and transcription machinery, promoted the activation of RIPK1. Furthermore, NSP12 323L variant, encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 C14408T variant first detected in Lombardy, Italy, that carries a Pro323Leu amino acid substitution in NSP12, showed increased ability to activate RIPK1. Inhibition of RIPK1 downregulated the transcriptional induction of proinflammatory cytokines and host factors including ACE2 and EGFR that promote viral entry into cells. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may have an unexpected and unusual ability to hijack the RIPK1-mediated host defense response to promote its own propagation and that inhibition of RIPK1 may provide a therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00578-7"

Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of MC4R–Gs-protein complexes with two drugs recently approved by the FDA, the peptide agonists NDP-α-MSH and setmelanotide, with 2.9 Å and 2.6 Å resolution. Together with signaling data from structure-derived MC4R mutants, the complex structures reveal the agonist-induced origin of transmembrane helix (TM) 6-regulated receptor activation. The ligand-binding modes of NDP-α-MSH, a high-affinity linear variant of the endogenous agonist α-MSH, and setmelanotide, a cyclic anti-obesity drug with biased signaling toward Gq/11, underline the key role of TM3 in ligand-specific interactions and of calcium ion as a ligand-adaptable cofactor. The agonist-specific TM3 interplay subsequently impacts receptor–Gs-protein interfaces at intracellular loop 2, which also regulates the G-protein coupling profile of this promiscuous receptor. Finally, our structures reveal mechanistic details of MC4R activation/inhibition, and provide important insights into the regulation of the receptor signaling profile which will facilitate the development of tailored anti-obesity drugs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00569-8"

Here, we retrieved blood samples from 19 asymptomatic and 12 presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2pos subjects, 47 age/gender-matched patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 and 27 normal subjects, and interrogated them with combined assays of 44-plex CyTOF, RNA-seq and Olink. Notably, both asymptomatic and presymptomatic subjects exhibited numerous readily detectable immunological alterations, while certain parameters including more severely decreased frequencies of CD107alow classical monocytes, intermediate monocytes, non-classical monocytes and CD62Lhi CD8+ Tnaïve cells, reduced plasma STC1 level but an increased frequency of CD4+ NKT cells combined to distinguish the latter. Intercorrelation analyses revealed a particular presymptomatic immunotype mainly manifesting as monocytic overactivation and differentiation blockage, a likely lymphocyte exhaustion and immunosuppression, yielding mechanistic insights into SSIS fate determination, which could potentially improve SARS-CoV-2 management.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00562-1"

Centriolar coiled-coil protein 110 (CP110) has been reported to suppress ciliogenesis initiation by capping the distal ends of mother centrioles. However, the mechanism underlying the specific degradation of mother centriole-capping CP110 to promote cilia initiation remains unknown. Here, we find that autophagy is crucial for CP110 degradation at mother centrioles after serum starvation in MEF cells. We further identify NudC-like protein 2 (NudCL2) as a novel selective autophagy receptor at mother centrioles, which contains an LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif mediating the association of CP110 and the autophagosome marker LC3. Knockout of NudCL2 induces defects in the removal of CP110 from mother centrioles and ciliogenesis, which are rescued by wild-type NudCL2 but not its LIR motif mutant. Knockdown of CP110 significantly attenuates ciliogenesis defects in NudCL2-deficient cells. In addition, NudCL2 morphants exhibit ciliation-related phenotypes in zebrafish, which are reversed by wild-type NudCL2, but not its LIR motif mutant. Importantly, CP110 depletion significantly reverses these ciliary phenotypes in NudCL2 morphants. Taken together, our data suggest that NudCL2 functions as an autophagy receptor mediating the selective degradation of mother centriole-capping CP110 to promote ciliogenesis, which is indispensable for embryo development in vertebrates.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00560-3"
"cr","Mechanical activation of spike fosters SARS-CoV-2 viral infection","The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) has caused a global COVID-19 pandemic. The spike protein of SARS2 (SARS2-S) recognizes host receptors, including ACE2, to initiate viral entry in a complex biomechanical environment. Here, we reveal that tensile force, generated by bending of the host cell membrane, strengthens spike recognition of ACE2 and accelerates the detachment of spike’s S1 subunit from the S2 subunit to rapidly prime the viral fusion machinery. Mechanistically, such mechano-activation is fulfilled by force-induced opening and rotation of spike’s receptor-binding domain to prolong the bond lifetime of spike/ACE2 binding, up to 4 times longer than that of SARS-S binding with ACE2 under 10 pN force application, and subsequently by force-accelerated S1/S2 detachment which is up to ~103 times faster than that in the no-force condition. Interestingly, the SARS2-S D614G mutant, a more infectious variant, shows 3-time stronger force-dependent ACE2 binding and 35-time faster force-induced S1/S2 detachment. We also reveal that an anti-S1/S2 non-RBD-blocking antibody that was derived from convalescent COVID-19 patients with potent neutralizing capability can reduce S1/S2 detachment by 3 × 106 times under force. Our study sheds light on the mechano-chemistry of spike activation and on developing a non-RBD-blocking but S1/S2-locking therapeutic strategy to prevent SARS2 invasion.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00558-x"

A major challenge is that the receptor-binding domain (RBD)-only vaccine fails to trigger long-lasting protective immunity if used alone for vaccination. To enhance antigen processing and cross-presentation in draining lymph nodes (DLNs), we developed an interferon (IFN)-armed RBD dimerized by an immunoglobulin fragment (I-R-F). I-R-F efficiently directs immunity against RBD to DLNs. A low dose of I-R-F induces not only high titers of long-lasting neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) but also more comprehensive T cell responses than RBD. Notably, I-R-F provides comprehensive protection in the form of a one-dose vaccine without an adjuvant. Our study shows that the pan-epitope modified human I-R-F (I-P-R-F) vaccine provides rapid and complete protection throughout the upper and lower respiratory tracts against a high-dose SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. Based on these promising results, we have initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase I/II trial of the human I-P-R-F vaccine (V-01) in 180 healthy adults, and the vaccine appears safe and elicits strong antiviral immune responses.

"cr","Degradation of lipid droplets by chimeric autophagy-tethering compounds","Degrading pathogenic proteins by degrader technologies such as PROTACs (proteolysis-targeting chimeras) provides promising therapeutic strategies, but selective degradation of non-protein pathogenic biomolecules has been challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel strategy to degrade non-protein biomolecules by autophagy-tethering compounds (ATTECs), using lipid droplets (LDs) as an exemplar target. LDs are ubiquitous cellular structures storing lipids and could be degraded by autophagy. We hypothesized that compounds interacting with both the LDs and the key autophagosome protein LC3 may enhance autophagic degradation of LDs. We designed and synthesized such compounds by connecting LC3-binding molecules to LD-binding probes via a linker. These compounds were capable of clearing LDs almost completely and rescued LD-related phenotypes in cells and in two independent mouse models with hepatic lipidosis. We further confirmed that the mechanism of action of these compounds was mediated through LC3 and autophagic degradation. Our proof-of-concept study demonstrates the capability of degrading LDs by ATTECs. Conceptually, this strategy could be applied to other protein and non-protein targets.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00532-7"
"cr","Pericytes augment glioblastoma cell resistance to temozolomide through CCL5-CCR5 paracrine signaling","Glioblastoma (GBM) is a prevalent and highly lethal form of glioma, with rapid tumor progression and frequent recurrence. Excessive outgrowth of pericytes in GBM governs the ecology of the perivascular niche, but their function in mediating chemoresistance has not been fully explored. Herein, we uncovered that pericytes potentiate DNA damage repair (DDR) in GBM cells residing in the perivascular niche, which induces temozolomide (TMZ) chemoresistance. We found that increased pericyte proportion correlates with accelerated tumor recurrence and worse prognosis. Genetic depletion of pericytes in GBM xenografts enhances TMZ-induced cytotoxicity and prolongs survival of tumor-bearing mice. Mechanistically, C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) secreted by pericytes activates C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) on GBM cells to enable DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs)-mediated DDR upon TMZ treatment. Disrupting CCL5-CCR5 paracrine signaling through the brain-penetrable CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (MVC) potently inhibits pericyte-promoted DDR and effectively improves the chemotherapeutic efficacy of TMZ. GBM patient-derived xenografts with high CCL5 expression benefit from combined treatment with TMZ and MVC. Our study reveals the role of pericytes as an extrinsic stimulator potentiating DDR signaling in GBM cells and suggests that targeting CCL5-CCR5 signaling could be an effective therapeutic strategy to improve chemotherapeutic efficacy against GBM.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00528-3"
"cr","Delineating spatiotemporal and hierarchical development of human fetal innate lymphoid cells","Whereas the critical roles of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in adult are increasingly appreciated, their developmental hierarchy in early human fetus remains largely elusive. In this study, we sorted human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, lymphoid progenitors, putative ILC progenitor/precursors and mature ILCs in the fetal hematopoietic, lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, from 8 to 12 post-conception weeks, for single-cell RNA-sequencing, followed by computational analysis and functional validation at bulk and single-cell levels. We delineated the early phase of ILC lineage commitment from hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, which mainly occurred in fetal liver and intestine. We further unveiled interleukin-3 receptor as a surface marker for the lymphoid progenitors in fetal liver with T, B, ILC and myeloid potentials, while IL-3RA– lymphoid progenitors were predominantly B-lineage committed. Notably, we determined the heterogeneity and tissue distribution of each ILC subpopulation, revealing the proliferating characteristics shared by the precursors of each ILC subtype. Additionally, a novel unconventional ILC2 subpopulation (CRTH2– CCR9+ ILC2) was identified in fetal thymus. Taken together, our study illuminates the precise cellular and molecular features underlying the stepwise formation of human fetal ILC hierarchy with remarkable spatiotemporal heterogeneity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00529-2"
"cr","A cohort autopsy study defines COVID-19 systemic pathogenesis","Severe COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 is frequently accompanied by dysfunction of the lungs and extrapulmonary organs. However, the organotropism of SARS-CoV-2 and the port of virus entry for systemic dissemination remain largely unknown. We profiled 26 COVID-19 autopsy cases from four cohorts in Wuhan, China, and determined the systemic distribution of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the lungs and multiple extrapulmonary organs of critically ill COVID-19 patients up to 67 days after symptom onset. Based on organotropism and pathological features of the patients, COVID-19 was divided into viral intrapulmonary and systemic subtypes. In patients with systemic viral distribution, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in monocytes, macrophages, and vascular endothelia at blood–air barrier, blood–testis barrier, and filtration barrier. Critically ill patients with long disease duration showed decreased pulmonary cell proliferation, reduced viral RNA, and marked fibrosis in the lungs. Permanent SARS-CoV-2 presence and tissue injuries in the lungs and extrapulmonary organs suggest direct viral invasion as a mechanism of pathogenicity in critically ill patients. SARS-CoV-2 may hijack monocytes, macrophages, and vascular endothelia at physiological barriers as the ports of entry for systemic dissemination. Our study thus delineates systemic pathological features of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which sheds light on the development of novel COVID-19 treatment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00523-8"

However, the origin of excessive damages caused by SARS-CoV-2 remains largely unknown. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 envelope (2-E) protein alone is able to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)-like damages in vitro and in vivo. 2-E proteins were found to form a type of pH-sensitive cation channels in bilayer lipid membranes. As observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, heterologous expression of 2-E channels induced rapid cell death in various susceptible cell types and robust secretion of cytokines and chemokines in macrophages. Intravenous administration of purified 2-E protein into mice caused ARDS-like pathological damages in lung and spleen. A dominant negative mutation lowering 2-E channel activity attenuated cell death and SARS-CoV-2 production. Newly identified channel inhibitors exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity and excellent cell protective activity in vitro and these activities were positively correlated with inhibition of 2-E channel. Importantly, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of the channel inhibitor effectively reduced both the viral load and secretion of inflammation cytokines in lungs of SARS-CoV-2-infected transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE-2). Our study supports that 2-E is a promising drug target against SARS-CoV-2.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00519-4"
"cr","RNA m6A modification orchestrates a LINE-1–host interaction that facilitates retrotransposition and contributes to long gene vulnerability","The molecular basis underlying the interaction between retrotransposable elements (RTEs) and the human genome remains poorly understood. Here, we profiled N6-methyladenosine (m6A) deposition on nascent RNAs in human cells by developing a new method MINT-Seq, which revealed that many classes of RTE RNAs, particularly intronic LINE-1s (L1s), are strongly methylated. These m6A-marked intronic L1s (MILs) are evolutionarily young, sense-oriented to hosting genes, and are bound by a dozen RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that are putative novel readers of m6A-modified RNAs, including a nuclear matrix protein SAFB. Notably, m6A positively controls the expression of both autonomous L1s and co-transcribed L1 relics, promoting L1 retrotransposition. We showed that MILs preferentially reside in long genes with critical roles in DNA damage repair and sometimes in L1 suppression per se, where they act as transcriptional “roadblocks” to impede the hosting gene expression, revealing a novel host-weakening strategy by the L1s. In counteraction, the host uses the SAFB reader complex to bind m6A-L1s to reduce their levels, and to safeguard hosting gene transcription. Remarkably, our analysis identified thousands of MILs in multiple human fetal tissues, enlisting them as a novel category of cell-type-specific regulatory elements that often compromise transcription of long genes and confer their vulnerability in neurodevelopmental disorders. We propose that this m6A-orchestrated L1–host interaction plays widespread roles in gene regulation, genome integrity, human development and diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00515-8"

Here we report the humoral immune response to circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as 501Y.V2 (B.1.351), of the plasma and neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) elicited by CoronaVac (inactivated vaccine), ZF2001 (RBD-subunit vaccine) and natural infection. Among 86 potent NAbs identified by high-throughput single-cell VDJ sequencing of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vaccinees and convalescents, near half anti-RBD NAbs showed major neutralization reductions against the K417N/E484K/N501Y mutation combination, with E484K being the dominant cause. VH3-53/VH3-66 recurrent antibodies respond differently to RBD variants, and K417N compromises the majority of neutralizing activity through reduced polar contacts with complementarity determining regions. In contrast, the 242–244 deletion (242–244Δ) would abolish most neutralization activity of anti-NTD NAbs by interrupting the conformation of NTD antigenic supersite, indicating a much less diversity of anti-NTD NAbs than anti-RBD NAbs. Plasma of convalescents and CoronaVac vaccinees displayed comparable neutralization reductions against pseudo- and authentic 501Y.V2 variants, mainly caused by E484K/N501Y and 242–244Δ, with the effects being additive. Importantly, RBD-subunit vaccinees exhibit markedly higher tolerance to 501Y.V2 than convalescents, since the elicited anti-RBD NAbs display a high diversity and are unaffected by NTD mutations. Moreover, an extended gap between the third and second doses of ZF2001 leads to better neutralizing activity and tolerance to 501Y.V2 than the standard three-dose administration. Together, these results suggest that the deployment of RBD-vaccines, through a third-dose boost, may be ideal for combating SARS-CoV-2 variants when necessary, especially for those carrying mutations that disrupt the NTD supersite.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00514-9"
"cr","The metabolite α-KG induces GSDMC-dependent pyroptosis through death receptor 6-activated caspase-8","Pyroptosis is a form of regulated cell death mediated by gasdermin family members, among which the function of GSDMC has not been clearly described. Herein, we demonstrate that the metabolite α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) induces pyroptosis through caspase-8-mediated cleavage of GSDMC. Treatment with DM-αKG, a cell-permeable derivative of α-KG, elevates ROS levels, which leads to oxidation of the plasma membrane-localized death receptor DR6. Oxidation of DR6 triggers its endocytosis, and then recruits both pro-caspase-8 and GSDMC to a DR6 receptosome through protein-protein interactions. The DR6 receptosome herein provides a platform for the cleavage of GSDMC by active caspase-8, thereby leading to pyroptosis. Moreover, this α-KG-induced pyroptosis could inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models. Interestingly, the efficiency of α-KG in inducing pyroptosis relies on an acidic environment in which α-KG is reduced by MDH1 and converted to L-2HG that further boosts ROS levels. Treatment with lactic acid, the end product of glycolysis, builds an improved acidic environment to facilitate more production of L-2HG, which makes the originally pyroptosis-resistant cancer cells more susceptible to α-KG-induced pyroptosis. This study not only illustrates a pyroptotic pathway linked with metabolites but also identifies an unreported principal axis extending from ROS-initiated DR6 endocytosis to caspase-8-mediated cleavage of GSDMC for potential clinical application in tumor therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00506-9"

"cr","Identification of an endogenous glutamatergic transmitter system controlling excitability and conductivity of atrial cardiomyocytes","As an excitatory transmitter system, the glutamatergic transmitter system controls excitability and conductivity of neurons. Since both cardiomyocytes and neurons are excitable cells, we hypothesized that cardiomyocytes may also be regulated by a similar system. Here, we have demonstrated that atrial cardiomyocytes have an intrinsic glutamatergic transmitter system, which regulates the generation and propagation of action potentials. First, there are abundant vesicles containing glutamate beneath the plasma membrane of rat atrial cardiomyocytes. Second, rat atrial cardiomyocytes express key elements of the glutamatergic transmitter system, such as the glutamate metabolic enzyme, ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), and glutamate transporters. Third, iGluR agonists evoke iGluR-gated currents and decrease the threshold of electrical excitability in rat atrial cardiomyocytes. Fourth, iGluR antagonists strikingly attenuate the conduction velocity of electrical impulses in rat atrial myocardium both in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of GRIA3 or GRIN1, two highly expressed iGluR subtypes in atria, drastically decreased the excitatory firing rate and slowed down the electrical conduction velocity in cultured human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived atrial cardiomyocyte monolayers. Finally, iGluR antagonists effectively prevent and terminate atrial fibrillation in a rat isolated heart model. In addition, the key elements of the glutamatergic transmitter system are also present and show electrophysiological functions in human atrial cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, our data reveal an intrinsic glutamatergic transmitter system directly modulating excitability and conductivity of atrial cardiomyocytes through controlling iGluR-gated currents. Manipulation of this system may open potential new avenues for therapeutic intervention of cardiac arrhythmias.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00499-5"

By combination of different genetic circuit modules, in vivo assembled siRNAs are systematically distributed to multiple tissues or targeted to specific tissues (e.g., brain), inducing potent target gene silencing in these tissues. The therapeutic value of our strategy is demonstrated by programmed silencing of critical targets associated with various diseases, including EGFR/KRAS in lung cancer, EGFR/TNC in glioblastoma and PTP1B in obesity. Overall, our strategy represents a next generation RNAi therapeutics, which makes RNAi therapy feasible.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00491-z"

We isolated a large number of nAbs from SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals capable of disrupting proper interaction between the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike (S) protein and the receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). However, the structural basis for their potent neutralizing activity remains unclear. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of the ten most potent nAbs in their native full-length IgG-form or in both IgG-form and Fab-form bound to the trimeric S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The bivalent binding of the full-length IgG is found to associate with more RBDs in the “up” conformation than the monovalent binding of Fab, perhaps contributing to the enhanced neutralizing activity of IgG and triggering more shedding of the S1 subunit from the S protein. Comparison of a large number of nAbs identified common and unique structural features associated with their potent neutralizing activities. This work provides a structural basis for further understanding the mechanism of nAbs, especially through revealing the bivalent binding and its correlation with more potent neutralization and the shedding of S1 subunit.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00487-9"

However, presently available tools for predicting RBP–RNA interactions employ RNA sequence and/or predicted RNA structures, and therefore do not capture their condition-dependent nature. Here, after profiling transcriptome-wide in vivo RNA secondary structures in seven cell types, we developed PrismNet, a deep learning tool that integrates experimental in vivo RNA structure data and RBP binding data for matched cells to accurately predict dynamic RBP binding in various cellular conditions. PrismNet results for 168 RBPs support its utility for both understanding CLIP-seq results and largely extending such interaction data to accurately analyze additional cell types. Further, PrismNet employs an “attention” strategy to computationally identify exact RBP-binding nucleotides, and we discovered enrichment among dynamic RBP-binding sites for structure-changing variants (riboSNitches), which can link genetic diseases with dysregulated RBP bindings. Our rich profiling data and deep learning-based prediction tool provide access to a previously inaccessible layer of cell-type-specific RBP–RNA interactions, with clear utility for understanding and treating human diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00476-y"

However, these two states of pluripotency may not be sufficient to reflect the full complexity and developmental potency of the epiblast during mammalian early development. Here we report the establishment of self-renewing formative pluripotent stem cells (fPSCs) which manifest features of epiblast cells poised for gastrulation. fPSCs can be established from different mouse ESCs, pre-/early-gastrula epiblasts and induced PSCs. Similar to pre-/early-gastrula epiblasts, fPSCs show the transcriptomic features of formative pluripotency, which are distinct from naïve ESCs and primed EpiSCs. fPSCs show the unique epigenetic states of E6.5 epiblast, including the super-bivalency of a large set of developmental genes. Just like epiblast cells immediately before gastrulation, fPSCs can efficiently differentiate into three germ layers and primordial germ cells (PGCs) in vitro. Thus, fPSCs highlight the feasibility of using PSCs to explore the development of mammalian epiblast.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00477-x"
"cr","Structural mechanism of cooperative activation of the human calcium-sensing receptor by Ca2+ ions and L-tryptophan","The human calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) is a class C G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) responsible for maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis in the blood. The general consensus is that extracellular Ca2+ is the principal agonist of CaSR. Aliphatic and aromatic L-amino acids, such as L-Phe and L-Trp, increase the sensitivity of CaSR towards Ca2+ and are considered allosteric activators. Crystal structures of the extracellular domain (ECD) of CaSR dimer have demonstrated Ca2+ and L-Trp binding sites and conformational changes of the ECD upon Ca2+/L-Trp binding. However, it remains to be understood at the structural level how Ca2+/L-Trp binding to the ECD leads to conformational changes in transmembrane domains (TMDs) and consequent CaSR activation. Here, we determined the structures of full-length human CaSR in the inactive state, Ca2+- or L-Trp-bound states, and Ca2+/L-Trp-bound active state using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. Structural studies demonstrate that L-Trp binding induces the closure of the Venus flytrap (VFT) domain of CaSR, bringing the receptor into an intermediate active state. Ca2+ binding relays the conformational changes from the VFT domains to the TMDs, consequently inducing close contact between the two TMDs of dimeric CaSR, activating the receptor. Importantly, our structural and functional studies reveal that Ca2+ ions and L-Trp activate CaSR cooperatively. Amino acids are not able to activate CaSR alone, but can promote the receptor activation in the presence of Ca2+. Our data provide complementary insights into the activation of class C GPCRs and may aid in the development of novel drugs targeting CaSR.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00474-0"

Here we report cathD plays an unconventional role as a cofilin phosphatase orchestrating actin remodeling. In neutral pH environments, the cathD precursor directly dephosphorylates and activates the actin-severing protein cofilin independent of its proteolytic activity, whereas mature cathD degrades cofilin in acidic pH conditions. During development, cathD complements the canonical cofilin phosphatase slingshot and regulates the morphogenesis of actin-based structures. Moreover, suppression of cathD phosphatase activity leads to defective actin organization and cytokinesis failure. Our findings identify cathD as a dual-function molecule, whose functional switch is regulated by environmental pH and its maturation state, and reveal a novel regulatory role of cathD in actin-based cellular processes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00454-w"
"cr","Homotypic clustering of L1 and B1/Alu repeats compartmentalizes the 3D genome","Organization of the genome into euchromatin and heterochromatin appears to be evolutionarily conserved and relatively stable during lineage differentiation. In an effort to unravel the basic principle underlying genome folding, here we focus on the genome itself and report a fundamental role for L1 (LINE1 or LINE-1) and B1/Alu retrotransposons, the most abundant subclasses of repetitive sequences, in chromatin compartmentalization. We find that homotypic clustering of L1 and B1/Alu demarcates the genome into grossly exclusive domains, and characterizes and predicts Hi-C compartments. Spatial segregation of L1-rich sequences in the nuclear and nucleolar peripheries and B1/Alu-rich sequences in the nuclear interior is conserved in mouse and human cells and occurs dynamically during the cell cycle. In addition, de novo establishment of L1 and B1 nuclear segregation is coincident with the formation of higher-order chromatin structures during early embryogenesis and appears to be critically regulated by L1 and B1 transcripts. Importantly, depletion of L1 transcripts in embryonic stem cells drastically weakens homotypic repeat contacts and compartmental strength, and disrupts the nuclear segregation of L1- or B1-rich chromosomal sequences at genome-wide and individual sites. Mechanistically, nuclear co-localization and liquid droplet formation of L1 repeat DNA and RNA with heterochromatin protein HP1α suggest a phase-separation mechanism by which L1 promotes heterochromatin compartmentalization. Taken together, we propose a genetically encoded model in which L1 and B1/Alu repeats blueprint chromatin macrostructure. Our model explains the robustness of genome folding into a common conserved core, on which dynamic gene regulation is overlaid across cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00466-6"

The molecular mechanism of interaction between host and viral genomic RNA is yet unclear. We demonstrate herein that SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, as well as the negative-sense RNA, is dynamically N6-methyladenosine (m6A)-modified in human and monkey cells. Combined RIP-seq and miCLIP analyses identified a total of 8 m6A sites at single-base resolution in the genome. Especially, epidemic strains with mutations at these identified m6A sites have emerged worldwide, and formed a unique cluster in the US as indicated by phylogenetic analysis. Further functional experiments showed that m6A methylation negatively regulates SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection also triggered a global increase in host m6A methylome, exhibiting altered localization and motifs of m6A methylation in mRNAs. Altogether, our results identify m6A as a dynamic epitranscriptomic mark mediating the virus–host interaction.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00465-7"
"cr","Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein is an endogenous β-arrestin-2-selective allosteric modulator of AT1 receptor counteracting vascular injury","Compelling evidence has revealed that biased activation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, including angiotensin II (AngII) receptor type 1 (AT1) signaling, plays pivotal roles in vascular homeostasis and injury, but whether a clinically relevant endogenous biased antagonism of AT1 signaling exists under physiological and pathophysiological conditions has not been clearly elucidated. Here, we show that an extracellular matrix protein, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), acts as an endogenous allosteric biased modulator of the AT1 receptor and its deficiency is clinically associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) development. COMP directly interacts with the extracellular N-terminus of the AT1 via its EGF domain and inhibits AT1-β-arrestin-2 signaling, but not Gq or Gi signaling, in a selective manner through allosteric regulation of AT1 intracellular conformational states. COMP deficiency results in activation of AT1a-β-arrestin-2 signaling and subsequent exclusive AAA formation in response to AngII infusion. AAAs in COMP–/– or ApoE–/– mice are rescued by AT1a or β-arrestin-2 deficiency, or the application of a peptidomimetic mimicking the AT1-binding motif of COMP. Explorations of the endogenous biased antagonism of AT1 receptor or other GPCRs may reveal novel therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00464-8"
"cr","Mispair-bound human MutS–MutL complex triggers DNA incisions and activates mismatch repair","DNA mismatch repair (MMR) relies on MutS and MutL ATPases for mismatch recognition and strand-specific nuclease recruitment to remove mispaired bases in daughter strands. However, whether the MutS–MutL complex coordinates MMR by ATP-dependent sliding on DNA or protein–protein interactions between the mismatch and strand discrimination signal is ambiguous. Using functional MMR assays and systems preventing proteins from sliding, we show that sliding of human MutSα is required not for MMR initiation, but for final mismatch removal. MutSα recruits MutLα to form a mismatch-bound complex, which initiates MMR by nicking the daughter strand 5′ to the mismatch. Exonuclease 1 (Exo1) is then recruited to the nick and conducts 5′ → 3′ excision. ATP-dependent MutSα dissociation from the mismatch is necessary for Exo1 to remove the mispaired base when the excision reaches the mismatch. Therefore, our study has resolved a long-standing puzzle, and provided new insights into the mechanism of MMR initiation and mispair removal.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00468-y"

Here, we perform single-cell deep-immune profiling of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from 5 patients with mild and 26 with critical COVID-19 in comparison to BALs from non-COVID-19 pneumonia and normal lung. We use pseudotime inference to build T-cell and monocyte-to-macrophage trajectories and model gene expression changes along them. In mild COVID-19, CD8+ resident-memory (TRM) and CD4+ T-helper-17 (TH17) cells undergo active (presumably antigen-driven) expansion towards the end of the trajectory, and are characterized by good effector functions, while in critical COVID-19 they remain more naïve. Vice versa, CD4+ T-cells with T-helper-1 characteristics (TH1-like) and CD8+ T-cells expressing exhaustion markers (TEX-like) are enriched halfway their trajectories in mild COVID-19, where they also exhibit good effector functions, while in critical COVID-19 they show evidence of inflammation-associated stress at the end of their trajectories. Monocyte-to-macrophage trajectories show that chronic hyperinflammatory monocytes are enriched in critical COVID-19, while alveolar macrophages, otherwise characterized by anti-inflammatory and antigen-presenting characteristics, are depleted. In critical COVID-19, monocytes contribute to an ATP-purinergic signaling-inflammasome footprint that could enable COVID-19 associated fibrosis and worsen disease-severity.

We found remarkable heterogeneity within human limb bud mesenchyme and epithelium, and aligned them along the proximal–distal and anterior–posterior axes using known marker genes. Osteo-chondrogenic progenitors first appeared in the core limb bud mesenchyme, which give rise to multiple populations of stem/progenitor cells in embryonic long bones undergoing endochondral ossification. Importantly, a perichondrial embryonic skeletal stem/progenitor cell (eSSPC) subset was identified, which could self-renew and generate the osteochondral lineage cells, but not adipocytes or hematopoietic stroma. eSSPCs are marked by the adhesion molecule CADM1 and highly enriched with FOXP1/2 transcriptional network. Interestingly, neural crest-derived cells with similar phenotypic markers and transcriptional networks were also found in the sagittal suture of human embryonic calvaria. Taken together, this study revealed the cellular heterogeneity and lineage hierarchy during human embryonic skeletogenesis, and identified distinct skeletal stem/progenitor cells that orchestrate endochondral and intramembranous ossification.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-021-00467-z"
"cr","Direct control of store-operated calcium channels by ultrafast laser","Ca2+ channels are essential to cell birth, life, and death. They can be externally activated by optogenetic tools, but this requires robust introduction of exogenous optogenetic genes for expression of photosensitive proteins in biological systems. Here we present femtoSOC, a method for direct control of Ca2+ channels solely by ultrafast laser without the need for optogenetic tools or any other exogenous reagents. Specifically, by focusing and scanning wavelength-tuned low-power femtosecond laser pulses on the plasma membrane for multiphoton excitation, we directly induced Ca2+ influx in cultured cells. Mechanistic study reveals that photoexcited flavins covalently bind cysteine residues in Orai1 via thioether bonds, which facilitates Orai1 polymerization to form store-operated calcium channels (SOCs) independently of STIM1, a protein generally participating in SOC formation, enabling all-optical activation of Ca2+ influx and downstream signaling pathways. Moreover, we used femtoSOC to demonstrate direct neural activation both in brain slices in vitro and in intact brains of living mice in vivo in a spatiotemporal-specific manner, indicating potential utility of femtoSOC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00463-9"
"cr","A novel somatosensory spatial navigation system outside the hippocampal formation","Spatially selective firing of place cells, grid cells, boundary vector/border cells and head direction cells constitutes the basic building blocks of a canonical spatial navigation system centered on the hippocampal-entorhinal complex. While head direction cells can be found throughout the brain, spatial tuning outside the hippocampal formation is often non-specific or conjunctive to other representations such as a reward. Although the precise mechanism of spatially selective firing activity is not understood, various studies show sensory inputs, particularly vision, heavily modulate spatial representation in the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit. To better understand the contribution of other sensory inputs in shaping spatial representation in the brain, we performed recording from the primary somatosensory cortex in foraging rats. To our surprise, we were able to detect the full complement of spatially selective firing patterns similar to that reported in the hippocampal-entorhinal network, namely, place cells, head direction cells, boundary vector/border cells, grid cells and conjunctive cells, in the somatosensory cortex. These newly identified somatosensory spatial cells form a spatial map outside the hippocampal formation and support the hypothesis that location information modulates body representation in the somatosensory cortex. Our findings provide transformative insights into our understanding of how spatial information is processed and integrated in the brain, as well as functional operations of the somatosensory cortex in the context of rehabilitation with brain-machine interfaces.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00448-8"
"cr","Mutual dependency between lncRNA LETN and protein NPM1 in controlling the nucleolar structure and functions sustaining cell proliferation","Fundamental processes such as ribosomal RNA synthesis and chromatin remodeling take place in the nucleolus, which is hyperactive in fast-proliferating cells. The sophisticated regulatory mechanism underlying the dynamic nucleolar structure and functions is yet to be fully explored. The present study uncovers the mutual functional dependency between a previously uncharacterized human long non-coding RNA, which we renamed LETN, and a key nucleolar protein, NPM1. Specifically, being upregulated in multiple types of cancer, LETN resides in the nucleolus via direct binding with NPM1. LETN plays a critical role in facilitating the formation of NPM1 pentamers, which are essential building blocks of the nucleolar granular component and control the nucleolar functions. Repression of LETN or NPM1 led to similar and profound changes of the nucleolar morphology and arrest of the nucleolar functions, which led to proliferation inhibition of human cancer cells and neural progenitor cells. Interestingly, this inter-dependency between LETN and NPM1 is associated with the evolutionarily new variations of NPM1 and the coincidental emergence of LETN in higher primates. We propose that this human-specific protein–lncRNA axis renders an additional yet critical layer of regulation with high physiological relevance in both cancerous and normal developmental processes that require hyperactive nucleoli.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00458-6"
"cr","AXL is a candidate receptor for SARS-CoV-2 that promotes infection of pulmonary and bronchial epithelial cells","The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a global public health challenge. The viral pathogen responsible, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), binds to the host receptor ACE2 through its spike (S) glycoprotein, which mediates membrane fusion and viral entry. Although the role of ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is clear, studies have shown that ACE2 expression is extremely low in various human tissues, especially in the respiratory tract. Thus, other host receptors and/or co-receptors that promote the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into cells of the respiratory system may exist. In this study, we found that the tyrosine-protein kinase receptor UFO (AXL) specifically interacts with the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 S. Using both a SARS-CoV-2 virus pseudotype and authentic SARS-CoV-2, we found that overexpression of AXL in HEK293T cells promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry as efficiently as overexpression of ACE2, while knocking out AXL significantly reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection in H1299 pulmonary cells and in human primary lung epithelial cells. Soluble human recombinant AXL blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells expressing high levels of AXL. The AXL expression level is well correlated with SARS-CoV-2 S level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from COVID-19 patients. Taken together, our findings suggest that AXL is a novel candidate receptor for SARS-CoV-2 which may play an important role in promoting viral infection of the human respiratory system and indicate that it is a potential target for future clinical intervention strategies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00460-y"

Here we used full-length Smart-seq2 single-cell RNA-sequencing to unravel tissue-specific transcriptional profiles and heterogeneity of CD127+ ILCs across four human tissues. Correlation analysis identified gene modules characterizing the migratory properties of tonsil and blood ILCs, and signatures of tissue-residency, activation and modified metabolism in colon and lung ILCs. Trajectory analysis revealed potential differentiation pathways from circulating and tissue-resident naïve ILCs to a spectrum of mature ILC subsets. In the lung we identified both CRTH2+ and CRTH2− ILC2 with lung-specific signatures, which could be recapitulated by alarmin-exposure of circulating ILC2. Finally, we describe unique TCR-V(D)J-rearrangement patterns of blood ILC1-like cells, revealing a subset of potentially immature ILCs with TCR-δ rearrangement. Our study provides a useful resource for in-depth understanding of ILC-mediated immunity in humans, with implications for disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00445-x"
"cr","Establishment of intestinal organoid cultures modeling injury-associated epithelial regeneration","The capacity of 3D organoids to mimic physiological tissue organization and functionality has provided an invaluable tool to model development and disease in vitro. However, conventional organoid cultures primarily represent the homeostasis of self-organizing stem cells and their derivatives. Here, we established a novel intestinal organoid culture system composed of 8 components, mainly including VPA, EPZ6438, LDN193189, and R-Spondin 1 conditioned medium, which mimics the gut epithelium regeneration that produces hyperplastic crypts following injury; therefore, these organoids were designated hyperplastic intestinal organoids (Hyper-organoids). Single-cell RNA sequencing identified different regenerative stem cell populations in our Hyper-organoids that shared molecular features with in vivo injury-responsive Lgr5+ stem cells or Clu+ revival stem cells. Further analysis revealed that VPA and EPZ6438 were indispensable for epigenome reprogramming and regeneration in Hyper-organoids, which functioned through epigenetically regulating YAP signaling. Furthermore, VPA and EPZ6438 synergistically promoted regenerative response in gut upon damage in vivo. In summary, our results demonstrated a new in vitro organoid model to study epithelial regeneration, highlighting the importance of epigenetic reprogramming that pioneers tissue repair.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00453-x"
"cr","Sequential fate-switches in stem-like cells drive the tumorigenic trajectory from human neural stem cells to malignant glioma","Glioblastoma (GBM) is an incurable and highly heterogeneous brain tumor, originating from human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSCs/hNPCs) years ahead of diagnosis. Despite extensive efforts to characterize hNSCs and end-stage GBM at bulk and single-cell levels, the de novo gliomagenic path from hNSCs is largely unknown due to technical difficulties in early-stage sampling and preclinical modeling. Here, we established two highly penetrant hNSC-derived malignant glioma models, which resemble the histopathology and transcriptional heterogeneity of human GBM. Integrating time-series analyses of whole-exome sequencing, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, we reconstructed gliomagenic trajectories, and identified a persistent NSC-like population at all stages of tumorigenesis. Through trajectory analyses and lineage tracing, we showed that tumor progression is primarily driven by multi-step transcriptional reprogramming and fate-switches in the NSC-like cells, which sequentially generate malignant heterogeneity and induce tumor phenotype transitions. We further uncovered stage-specific oncogenic cascades, and among the candidate genes we functionally validated C1QL1 as a new glioma-promoting factor. Importantly, the neurogenic-to-gliogenic switch in NSC-like cells marks an early stage characterized by a burst of oncogenic alterations, during which transient AP-1 inhibition is sufficient to inhibit gliomagenesis. Together, our results reveal previously undercharacterized molecular dynamics and fate choices driving de novo gliomagenesis from hNSCs, and provide a blueprint for potential early-stage treatment/diagnosis for GBM.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00451-z"

Despite the discovery of numerous neuromodulators that regulate food intake in Drosophila, the mechanism of satiety sensing remains largely elusive. Here, we investigated how neuropeptidergic circuitry conveyed satiety state to influence flies’ food consumption. Drosophila tackykinin (DTK) and its receptor TAKR99D were identified in an RNAi screening as feeding suppressors. Two pairs of DTK+ neurons in the fly brain could be activated by elevated D-glucose in the hemolymph and imposed a suppressive effect on feeding. These DTK+ neurons formed a two-synapse circuitry targeting insulin-producing cells, a well-known feeding suppressor, via TAKR99D+ neurons, and this circuitry could be rapidly activated during food ingestion and cease feeding. Taken together, we identified a novel satiety sensor in the fly brain that could detect specific circulating nutrients and in turn modulate feeding, shedding light on the neural regulation of energy homeostasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00449-7"
"cr","Ferroptosis: molecular mechanisms and health implications","Cell death can be executed through different subroutines. Since the description of ferroptosis as an iron-dependent form of non-apoptotic cell death in 2012, there has been mounting interest in the process and function of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis can occur through two major pathways, the extrinsic or transporter-dependent pathway and the intrinsic or enzyme-regulated pathway. Ferroptosis is caused by a redox imbalance between the production of oxidants and antioxidants, which is driven by the abnormal expression and activity of multiple redox-active enzymes that produce or detoxify free radicals and lipid oxidation products. Accordingly, ferroptosis is precisely regulated at multiple levels, including epigenetic, transcriptional, posttranscriptional and posttranslational layers. The transcription factor NFE2L2 plays a central role in upregulating anti-ferroptotic defense, whereas selective autophagy may promote ferroptotic death. Here, we review current knowledge on the integrated molecular machinery of ferroptosis and describe how dysregulated ferroptosis is involved in cancer, neurodegeneration, tissue injury, inflammation, and infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00441-1"

Here, we exploited antibody cooperativity to develop a therapeutic antibody cocktail against SARS-CoV-2. On the basis of our previously identified humanized cross-neutralizing antibody H014, we systematically analyzed a fully human naive antibody library and rationally identified a potent neutralizing antibody partner, P17, which confers effective protection in animal model. Cryo-EM studies dissected the nature of the P17 epitope, which is SARS-CoV-2 specific and distinctly different from that of H014. High-resolution structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in complex with H014 and P17, together with functional investigations revealed that in a two-antibody cocktail, synergistic neutralization was achieved by S1 shielding and conformational locking, thereby blocking receptor attachment and viral membrane fusion, conferring high potency as well as robustness against viral mutation escape. Furthermore, cluster analysis identified a hypothetical 3rd antibody partner for further reinforcing the cocktail as pan-SARS-CoVs therapeutics.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00444-y"

Currently, however, no effective drug or vaccine is available to treat or prevent the resulting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we report our discovery of a promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidate, the lipoglycopeptide antibiotic dalbavancin, based on virtual screening of the FDA-approved peptide drug library combined with in vitro and in vivo functional antiviral assays. Our results showed that dalbavancin directly binds to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) with high affinity, thereby blocking its interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Furthermore, dalbavancin effectively prevents SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells with an EC50 of ~12 nM. In both mouse and rhesus macaque models, viral replication and histopathological injuries caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection are significantly inhibited by dalbavancin administration. Given its high safety and long plasma half-life (8–10 days) shown in previous clinical trials, our data indicate that dalbavancin is a promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidate.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00450-0"
"cr","A unique hormonal recognition feature of the human glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor","Glucagon-like peptides (GLP-1 and GLP-2) are two proglucagon-derived intestinal hormones that mediate distinct physiological functions through two related receptors (GLP-1R and GLP-2R) which are important drug targets for metabolic disorders and Crohn’s disease, respectively. Despite great progress in GLP-1R structure determination, our understanding on the differences of peptide binding and signal transduction between these two receptors remains elusive. Here we report the electron microscopy structure of the human GLP-2R in complex with GLP-2 and a Gs heterotrimer. To accommodate GLP-2 rather than GLP-1, GLP-2R fine-tunes the conformations of the extracellular parts of transmembrane helices (TMs) 1, 5, 7 and extracellular loop 1 (ECL1). In contrast to GLP-1, the N-terminal histidine of GLP-2 penetrates into the receptor core with a unique orientation. The middle region of GLP-2 engages with TM1 and TM7 more extensively than with ECL2, and the GLP-2 C-terminus closely attaches to ECL1, which is the most protruded among 9 class B G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Functional studies revealed that the above three segments of GLP-2 are essential for GLP-2 recognition and receptor activation, especially the middle region. These results provide new insights into the molecular basis of ligand specificity in class B GPCRs and may facilitate the development of more specific therapeutics.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00442-0"

In this study, we show that mucins are accumulated in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients and are upregulated in the lungs of severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected mice and macaques. We find that induction of either interferon (IFN)-β or IFN-γ upon SARS-CoV-2 infection results in activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling through an IDO-Kyn-dependent pathway, leading to transcriptional upregulation of the expression of mucins, both the secreted and membrane-bound, in alveolar epithelial cells. Consequently, accumulated alveolar mucus affects the blood-gas barrier, thus inducing hypoxia and diminishing lung capacity, which can be reversed by blocking AhR activity. These findings potentially explain the silent hypoxia formation in COVID-19 patients, and suggest a possible intervention strategy by targeting the AhR pathway.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00435-z"

Here, we report formation of ER whorls as an effector mechanism of the ER stress response. We found that strong ER stress induces formation of ER whorls, which contain ER-resident proteins such as the Sec61 complex and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK). ER whorl formation is dependent on PERK kinase activity and is mediated by COPII machinery, which facilitates ER membrane budding to form tubular-vesicular ER whorl precursors. ER whorl precursors then go through Sec22b-mediated fusion to form ER whorls. We further show that ER whorls contribute to ER stress-induced translational inhibition by possibly modulating PERK activity and by sequestering translocons in a ribosome-free environment. We propose that formation of ER whorls reflects a new type of ER stress response that controls inhibition of protein translation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00416-2"
"cr","LRP6 downregulation promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration","The adult mammalian heart is thought to be a terminally differentiated organ given the postmitotic nature of cardiomyocytes. Consequently, the potential for cardiac repair through cardiomyocyte proliferation is extremely limited. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) is a Wnt co-receptor that is required for embryonic heart development. In this study we investigated the role of LRP6 in heart repair through regulation of cardiomyocyte proliferation. Lrp6 deficiency increased cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity in neonatal, juvenile and adult mice. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Lrp6 in the mouse heart induced a robust regenerative response after myocardial infarction (MI), led to reduced MI area and improvement in left ventricular systolic function. In vivo genetic lineage tracing revealed that the newly formed cardiomyocytes in Lrp6-deficient mouse hearts after MI were mainly derived from resident cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, we found that the pro-proliferative effect of Lrp6 deficiency was mediated by the ING5/P21 signaling pathway. Gene therapy using the adeno-associated virus (AAV)9 miRNAi-Lrp6 construct promoted the repair of heart injury in mice. Lrp6 deficiency also induced the proliferation of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs). Our study identifies LRP6 as a critical regulator of cardiomyocyte proliferation, which may lead to the development of a novel molecular strategy to promote myocardial regeneration and repair.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00411-7"
"cr","RAB31 marks and controls an ESCRT-independent exosome pathway","Exosomes are generated within the multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) as intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) and secreted during the fusion of MVEs with the cell membrane. The mechanisms of exosome biogenesis remain poorly explored. Here we identify that RAB31 marks and controls an ESCRT-independent exosome pathway. Active RAB31, phosphorylated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), engages flotillin proteins in lipid raft microdomains to drive EGFR entry into MVEs to form ILVs, which is independent of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) machinery. Active RAB31 interacts with the SPFH domain and drives ILV formation via the Flotillin domain of flotillin proteins. Meanwhile, RAB31 recruits GTPase-activating protein TBC1D2B to inactivate RAB7, thereby preventing the fusion of MVEs with lysosomes and enabling the secretion of ILVs as exosomes. These findings establish that RAB31 has dual functions in the biogenesis of exosomes: driving ILVs formation and suppressing MVEs degradation, providing an exquisite framework to better understand exosome biogenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00409-1"

Resolving cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with aging in higher mammals is therefore urgently needed. Here, we created young and old non-human primate single-nucleus/cell transcriptomic atlases of lung, heart and artery, the top tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of cell type-specific aging-associated transcriptional changes revealed increased systemic inflammation and compromised virus defense as a hallmark of cardiopulmonary aging. With age, expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was increased in the pulmonary alveolar epithelial barrier, cardiomyocytes, and vascular endothelial cells. We found that interleukin 7 (IL7) accumulated in aged cardiopulmonary tissues and induced ACE2 expression in human vascular endothelial cells in an NF-κB-dependent manner. Furthermore, treatment with vitamin C blocked IL7-induced ACE2 expression. Altogether, our findings depict the first transcriptomic atlas of the aged primate cardiopulmonary system and provide vital insights into age-linked susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that geroprotective strategies may reduce COVID-19 severity in the elderly.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00412-6"

The transcriptional landscapes of human FGC development have been revealed; however, the epigenetic reprogramming process of FGCs remains elusive. Here, we profiled the genome-wide DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility of human FGCs at different phases as well as gonadal niche cells at single-cell resolution. First, we found that DNA methylation levels of FGCs changed in a temporal manner, whereas FGCs at different phases in the same embryo exhibited comparable DNA methylation levels and patterns. Second, we revealed the phase-specific chromatin accessibility signatures at the promoter regions of a large set of critical transcription factors and signaling pathway genes. We also identified potential distal regulatory elements including enhancers in FGCs. Third, compared with other hominid-specific retrotransposons, SVA_D might have a broad spectrum of binding capacity for transcription factors, including SOX15 and SOX17. Finally, using an in vitro culture system of human FGCs, we showed that the BMP signaling pathway promoted the cell proliferation of FGCs, and regulated the WNT signaling pathway by orchestrating the chromatin accessibility of its ligand genes. Our single-cell epigenomic atlas and functional assays provide valuable insights for understanding the strongly heterogeneous, unsynchronized, yet highly robust nature of human germ cell development.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00401-9"

Understanding the mechanisms of phospholipid translocation between the inner and outer membrane represents one of the major challenges surrounding bacterial phospholipid homeostasis. The conserved MlaFEDB complex in the inner membrane functions as an ABC transporter to drive the translocation of phospholipids between the inner membrane and the periplasmic protein MlaC. However, the mechanism of phospholipid translocation remains elusive. Here we determined three cryo-EM structures of MlaFEDB from Escherichia coli in its nucleotide-free and ATP-bound conformations, and performed extensive functional studies to verify and extend our findings from structural analyses. Our work reveals unique structural features of the entire MlaFEDB complex, six well-resolved phospholipids in three distinct cavities, and large-scale conformational changes upon ATP binding. Together, these findings define the cycle of structural rearrangement of MlaFEDB in action, and suggest that MlaFEDB uses an extrusion mechanism to extract and release phospholipids through the central translocation cavity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00404-6"

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer therapeutics by removing such brakes. Unfortunately, only a minority of cancer patients respond to immunotherapies presumably due to inadequate immunity. Antitumor immunity depends on the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, as STING-deficient mice fail to stimulate tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells (DCs) to activate CD8+ T cells. STING agonists also enhance natural killer (NK) cells to mediate the clearance of CD8+ T cell-resistant tumors. Therefore STING agonists have been intensively sought after. We previously discovered that manganese (Mn) is indispensable for the host defense against cytosolic dsDNA by activating cGAS-STING. Here we report that Mn is also essential in innate immune sensing of tumors and enhances adaptive immune responses against tumors. Mn-insufficient mice had significantly enhanced tumor growth and metastasis, with greatly reduced tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Mechanically, Mn2+ promoted DC and macrophage maturation and tumor-specific antigen presentation, augmented CD8+ T cell differentiation, activation and NK cell activation, and increased memory CD8+ T cells. Combining Mn2+ with immune checkpoint inhibition synergistically boosted antitumor efficacies and reduced the anti-PD-1 antibody dosage required in mice. Importantly, a completed phase 1 clinical trial with the combined regimen of Mn2+ and anti-PD-1 antibody showed promising efficacy, exhibiting type I IFN induction, manageable safety and revived responses to immunotherapy in most patients with advanced metastatic solid tumors. We propose that this combination strategy warrants further clinical translation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00395-4"
"cr","Myofiber necroptosis promotes muscle stem cell proliferation via releasing Tenascin-C during regeneration","Necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is characterized by the loss of membrane integrity and release of intracellular contents, the execution of which depends on the membrane-disrupting activity of the Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain-Like protein (MLKL) upon its phosphorylation. Here we found myofibers committed MLKL-dependent necroptosis after muscle injury. Either pharmacological inhibition of the necroptosis upstream kinase Receptor Interacting Protein Kinases 1 (RIPK1) or genetic ablation of MLKL expression in myofibers led to significant muscle regeneration defects. By releasing factors into the muscle stem cell (MuSC) microenvironment, necroptotic myofibers facilitated muscle regeneration. Tenascin-C (TNC), released by necroptotic myofibers, was found to be critical for MuSC proliferation. The temporary expression of TNC in myofibers is tightly controlled by necroptosis; the extracellular release of TNC depends on necroptotic membrane rupture. TNC directly activated EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway in MuSCs through its N-terminus assembly domain together with the EGF-like domain. These findings indicate that necroptosis plays a key role in promoting MuSC proliferation to facilitate muscle regeneration.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-00393-6"

Here, we show that SIDT1 expressed on gastric pit cells in the stomach is required for the absorption of dietary microRNAs. SIDT1-deficient mice show reduced basal levels and impaired dynamic absorption of dietary microRNAs. Notably, we identified the stomach as the primary site for dietary microRNA absorption, which is dramatically attenuated in the stomachs of SIDT1-deficient mice. Mechanistic analyses revealed that the uptake of exogenous microRNAs by gastric pit cells is SIDT1 and low-pH dependent. Furthermore, oral administration of plant-derived miR2911 retards liver fibrosis, and this protective effect was abolished in SIDT1-deficient mice.

"cr","A virus-induced conformational switch of STAT1-STAT2 dimers boosts antiviral defenses","Type I interferons (IFN-I) protect us from viral infections. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 2 (STAT2) is a key component of interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which drives gene expression in response to IFN-I. Using electron microscopy, we found that, in naive cells, U-STAT2, lacking the activating tyrosine phosphorylation, forms a heterodimer with U-STAT1 in an inactive, anti-parallel conformation. A novel phosphorylation of STAT2 on T404 promotes IFN-I signaling by disrupting the U-STAT1-U-STAT2 dimer, facilitating the tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 2 and enhancing the DNA-binding ability of ISGF3. IKK-ε, activated by virus infection, phosphorylates T404 directly. Mice with a T-A mutation at the corresponding residue (T403) are highly susceptible to virus infections. We conclude that T404 phosphorylation drives a critical conformational switch that, by boosting the response to IFN-I in infected cells, enables a swift and efficient antiviral defense.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0386-6"

However, it remains elusive whether the deregulation of circadian clock proteins underlies stem cell aging and whether they are targetable for the alleviation of aging-associated syndromes. Here, we identified a transcription factor-independent role of CLOCK, a core component of the molecular circadian clock machinery, in counteracting human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) decay. CLOCK expression was decreased during hMSC aging. In addition, CLOCK deficiency accelerated hMSC senescence, whereas the overexpression of CLOCK, even as a transcriptionally inactive form, rejuvenated physiologically and pathologically aged hMSCs. Mechanistic studies revealed that CLOCK formed complexes with nuclear lamina proteins and KAP1, thus maintaining heterochromatin architecture and stabilizing repetitive genomic sequences. Finally, gene therapy with lentiviral vectors encoding CLOCK promoted cartilage regeneration and attenuated age-related articular degeneration in mice. These findings demonstrate a noncanonical role of CLOCK in stabilizing heterochromatin, promoting tissue regeneration, and mitigating aging-associated chronic diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0385-7"
"cr","Molecular subtyping and genomic profiling expand precision medicine in refractory metastatic triple-negative breast cancer: the FUTURE trial","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous disease, and molecular subtyping may result in improved diagnostic precision and targeted therapies. Our previous study classified TNBCs into four subtypes with putative therapeutic targets. Here, we conducted the FUTURE trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03805399), a phase Ib/II subtyping-based and genomic biomarker-guided umbrella trial, to evaluate the efficacy of these targets. Patients with refractory metastatic TNBC were enrolled and stratified by TNBC subtypes and genomic biomarkers, and assigned to one of these seven arms: (A) pyrotinib with capecitabine, (B) androgen receptor inhibitor with CDK4/6 inhibitor, (C) anti PD-1 with nab-paclitaxel, (D) PARP inhibitor included, (E) and (F) anti-VEGFR included, or (G) mTOR inhibitor with nab-paclitaxel. The primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR). We enrolled 69 refractory metastatic TNBC patients with a median of three previous lines of therapy (range, 1–8). Objective response was achieved in 20 (29.0%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 18.7%–41.2%) of the 69 intention-to-treat (ITT) patients. Our results showed that immunotherapy (arm C), in particular, achieved the highest ORR (52.6%, 95% CI: 28.9%–75.6%) in the ITT population. Arm E demonstrated favorable ORR (26.1%, 95% CI: 10.2%–48.4% in the ITT population) but with more high grade (≥ 3) adverse events. Somatic mutations of TOP2A and CD8 immunohistochemical score may have the potential to predict immunotherapy response in the immunomodulatory subtype of TNBC. In conclusion, the phase Ib/II FUTURE trial suggested a new concept for TNBC treatment, demonstrating the clinical benefit of subtyping-based targeted therapy for refractory metastatic TNBC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0375-9"
"cr","Metabolic signaling in T cells","The maintenance of organismal homeostasis requires partitioning and transport of biochemical molecules between organ systems, their composite cells, and subcellular organelles. Although transcriptional programming undeniably defines the functional state of cells and tissues, underlying biochemical networks are intricately intertwined with transcriptional, translational, and post-translational regulation. Studies of the metabolic regulation of immunity have elegantly illustrated this phenomenon. The cells of the immune system interface with a diverse set of environmental conditions. Circulating immune cells perfuse peripheral organs in the blood and lymph, patrolling for pathogen invasion. Resident immune cells remain in tissues and play more newly appreciated roles in tissue homeostasis and immunity. Each of these cell populations interacts with unique and dynamic tissue environments, which vary greatly in biochemical composition. Furthermore, the effector response of immune cells to a diverse set of activating cues requires unique cellular adaptations to supply the requisite biochemical landscape. In this review, we examine the role of spatial partitioning of metabolic processes in immune function. We focus on studies of lymphocyte metabolism, with reference to the greater immunometabolism literature when appropriate to illustrate this concept.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0379-5"

Increasing evidence indicates that targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME) represents a promising therapeutic approach in NPC, highlighting an urgent need to deepen the understanding of the complex NPC TME. Here, we generated single-cell transcriptome profiles for 7581 malignant cells and 40,285 immune cells from fifteen primary NPC tumors and one normal sample. We revealed malignant signatures capturing intratumoral transcriptional heterogeneity and predicting aggressiveness of malignant cells. Diverse immune cell subtypes were identified, including novel subtypes such as CLEC9A+ dendritic cells (DCs). We further revealed transcriptional regulators underlying immune cell diversity, and cell–cell interaction analyses highlighted promising immunotherapeutic targets in NPC. Moreover, we established the immune subtype-specific signatures, and demonstrated that the signatures of macrophages, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), CLEC9A+ DCs, natural killer (NK) cells, and plasma cells were significantly associated with improved survival outcomes in NPC. Taken together, our findings represent a unique resource providing in-depth insights into the cellular heterogeneity of NPC TME and highlight potential biomarkers for anticancer treatment and risk stratification, laying a new foundation for precision therapies in NPC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0374-x"

However, the characteristics and developmental programs of many of these cell lineages remain unclear, especially in humans. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of whole human and mouse fetal livers throughout development. We identified four cell lineage families of endoderm-derived, erythroid, non-erythroid hematopoietic, and mesoderm-derived non-hematopoietic cells, and defined the developmental pathways of the major cell lineage families. In both humans and mice, we identified novel markers of hepatic lineages and an ID3+ subpopulation of hepatoblasts as well as verified that hepatoblast differentiation follows the “default-directed” model. Additionally, we found that human but not mouse fetal hepatocytes display heterogeneity associated with expression of metabolism-related genes. We described the developmental process of erythroid progenitor cells during human and mouse hematopoiesis. Moreover, despite the general conservation of cell differentiation programs between species, we observed different cell lineage compositions during hematopoiesis in the human and mouse fetal livers. Taken together, these results reveal the dynamic cell landscape of fetal liver development and illustrate the similarities and differences in liver development between species, providing an extensive resource for inducing various liver cell lineages in vitro.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0378-6"
"cr","Wnt signaling and Loxl2 promote aggressive osteosarcoma","Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most frequent primary malignant bone tumor in urgent need of better therapies. Using genetically modified mouse models (GEMMs), we demonstrate that Wnt signaling promotes c-Fos-induced OS formation via the actions of the collagen-modifying enzyme Loxl2. c-Fos/AP-1 directly regulates the expression of the Wnt ligands Wnt7b and Wnt9a in OS cells through promoter binding, and Wnt7b and Wnt9a in turn promote Loxl2 expression in murine and human OS cells through the transcription factors Zeb1 and Zeb2. Concordantly, inhibition of Wnt ligand secretion by inactivating the Wnt-less (Wls) gene in osteoblasts in c-Fos GEMMs either early or in a therapeutic setting reduces Loxl2 expression and progression of OS. Wls-deficient osteosarcomas proliferate less, are less mineralized and are enriched in fibroblastic cells surrounded by collagen fibers. Importantly, Loxl2 inhibition using either the pan-Lox inhibitor BAPN or a specific inducible shRNA reduces OS cell proliferation in vitro and decreases tumor growth and lung colonization in murine and human orthotopic OS transplantation models. Finally, OS development is delayed in c-Fos GEMMs treated with BAPN or with specific Loxl2 blocking antibodies. Congruently, a strong correlation between c-FOS, LOXL2 and WNT7B/WNT9A expression is observed in human OS samples, and c-FOS/LOXL2 co-expression correlates with OS aggressiveness and decreased patient survival. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of Wnt and/or Loxl2 should be considered to potentiate the inadequate current treatments for pediatric, recurrent, and metastatic OS.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0370-1"
"cr","Infection with novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes pneumonia in Rhesus macaques","The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak is a major challenge for public health. SARS-CoV-2 infection in human has a broad clinical spectrum ranging from mild to severe cases, with a mortality rate of ~6.4% worldwide (based on World Health Organization daily situation report). However, the dynamics of viral infection, replication and shedding are poorly understood. Here, we show that Rhesus macaques are susceptible to the infection by SARS-CoV-2. After intratracheal inoculation, the first peak of viral RNA was observed in oropharyngeal swabs one day post infection (1 d.p.i.), mainly from the input of the inoculation, while the second peak occurred at 5 d.p.i., which reflected on-site replication in the respiratory tract. Histopathological observation shows that SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause interstitial pneumonia in animals, characterized by hyperemia and edema, and infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes in alveoli. We also identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory tract tissues, including trachea, bronchus and lung; and viruses were also re-isolated from oropharyngeal swabs, bronchus and lung, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies generated from the primary infection could protect the Rhesus macaques from a second-round challenge by SARS-CoV-2. The non-human primate model that we established here provides a valuable platform to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and to evaluate candidate vaccines and therapeutics.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0364-z"

Here, we present a complete atomic model of EBV, including the icosahedral capsid, the dodecameric portal and the capsid-associated tegument complex (CATC). Our in situ portal from the tegumented capsid adopts a closed conformation with its channel valve holding the terminal viral DNA and with its crown region firmly engaged by three layers of ring-like dsDNA, which, together with the penton flexibility, effectively alleviates the capsid inner pressure placed on the portal cap. In contrast, the CATCs, through binding to the flexible penton vertices in a stoichiometric manner, accurately increase the inner capsid pressure to facilitate the pressure-driven genome delivery. Together, our results provide important insights into the mechanism by which the EBV capsid, portal, packaged genome and the CATCs coordinately achieve a pressure balance to simultaneously benefit both viral genome retention and ejection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0363-0"
"cr","A novel selective autophagy receptor, CCDC50, delivers K63 polyubiquitination-activated RIG-I/MDA5 for degradation during viral infection","Autophagy is a conserved process that delivers cytosolic substances to the lysosome for degradation, but its direct role in the regulation of antiviral innate immunity remains poorly understood. Here, through high-throughput screening, we discovered that CCDC50 functions as a previously unknown autophagy receptor that negatively regulates the type I interferon (IFN) signaling pathway initiated by RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), the sensors for RNA viruses. The expression of CCDC50 is enhanced by viral infection, and CCDC50 specifically recognizes K63-polyubiquitinated RLRs, thus delivering the activated RIG-I/MDA5 for autophagic degradation. The association of CCDC50 with phagophore membrane protein LC3 is confirmed by crystal structure analysis. In contrast to other known autophagic cargo receptors that associate with either the LIR-docking site (LDS) or the UIM-docking site (UDS) of LC3, CCDC50 can bind to both LDS and UDS, representing a new type of cargo receptor. In mouse models with RNA virus infection, CCDC50 deficiency reduces the autophagic degradation of RIG-I/MDA5 and promotes type I IFN responses, resulting in enhanced viral resistance and improved survival rates. These results reveal a new link between autophagy and antiviral innate immune responses and provide additional insights into the regulatory mechanisms of RLR-mediated antiviral signaling.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0362-1"

To address this issue, we analyzed 863 genomes from a worldwide sampling of chickens and representatives of all four species of wild jungle fowl and each of the five subspecies of red jungle fowl (RJF). Our study suggests that domestic chickens were initially derived from the RJF subspecies Gallus gallus spadiceus whose present-day distribution is predominantly in southwestern China, northern Thailand and Myanmar. Following their domestication, chickens were translocated across Southeast and South Asia where they interbred locally with both RJF subspecies and other jungle fowl species. In addition, our results show that the White Leghorn chicken breed possesses a mosaic of divergent ancestries inherited from other subspecies of RJF. Despite the strong episodic gene flow from geographically divergent lineages of jungle fowls, our analyses show that domestic chickens undergo genetic adaptations that underlie their unique behavioral, morphological and reproductive traits. Our study provides novel insights into the evolutionary history of domestic chickens and a valuable resource to facilitate ongoing genetic and functional investigations of the world’s most numerous domestic animal.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0349-y"

An outstanding question is to what extent this heterogeneity is similar between cancers affecting different organs. Here, we profile 233,591 single cells from patients with lung, colorectal, ovary and breast cancer (n = 36) and construct a pan-cancer blueprint of stromal cell heterogeneity using different single-cell RNA and protein-based technologies. We identify 68 stromal cell populations, of which 46 are shared between cancer types and 22 are unique. We also characterise each population phenotypically by highlighting its marker genes, transcription factors, metabolic activities and tissue-specific expression differences. Resident cell types are characterised by substantial tissue specificity, while tumor-infiltrating cell types are largely shared across cancer types. Finally, by applying the blueprint to melanoma tumors treated with checkpoint immunotherapy and identifying a naïve CD4+ T-cell phenotype predictive of response to checkpoint immunotherapy, we illustrate how it can serve as a guide to interpret scRNA-seq data. In conclusion, by providing a comprehensive blueprint through an interactive web server, we generate the first panoramic view on the shared complexity of stromal cells in different cancers.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0355-0"
"cr","High-resolution mapping of mitotic DNA synthesis regions and common fragile sites in the human genome through direct sequencing","DNA replication stress, a feature of human cancers, often leads to instability at specific genomic loci, such as the common fragile sites (CFSs). Cells experiencing DNA replication stress may also exhibit mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS). To understand the physiological function of MiDAS and its relationship to CFSs, we mapped, at high resolution, the genomic sites of MiDAS in cells treated with the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin. Sites of MiDAS were evident as well-defined peaks that were largely conserved between cell lines and encompassed all known CFSs. The MiDAS peaks mapped within large, transcribed, origin-poor genomic regions. In cells that had been treated with aphidicolin, these regions remained unreplicated even in late S phase; MiDAS then served to complete their replication after the cells entered mitosis. Interestingly, leading and lagging strand synthesis were uncoupled in MiDAS, consistent with MiDAS being a form of break-induced replication, a repair mechanism for collapsed DNA replication forks. Our results provide a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to genomic instability at CFSs and in cancer cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0358-x"

However, there are still no effective drugs to treat lung injury and fibrosis. In this study, we report the generation of clinical-grade human embryonic stem cells (hESCs)-derived immunity- and matrix-regulatory cells (IMRCs) produced under good manufacturing practice requirements, that can treat lung injury and fibrosis in vivo. We generate IMRCs by sequentially differentiating hESCs with serum-free reagents. IMRCs possess a unique gene expression profile distinct from that of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs), such as higher expression levels of proliferative, immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic genes. Moreover, intravenous delivery of IMRCs inhibits both pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mouse models of lung injury, and significantly improves the survival rate of the recipient mice in a dose-dependent manner, likely through paracrine regulatory mechanisms. IMRCs are superior to both primary UCMSCs and the FDA-approved drug pirfenidone, with an excellent efficacy and safety profile in mice and monkeys. In light of public health crises involving pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, our findings suggest that IMRCs are ready for clinical trials on lung disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0354-1"

While imaging-based technologies such as in situ sequencing show great promise, technical difficulties currently limit their wide usage. Here we hypothesize that cellular spatial organization is inherently encoded by cell identity and can be reconstructed, at least in part, by ligand-receptor interactions, and we present CSOmap, a computational tool to infer cellular interaction de novo from scRNA-seq. We show that CSOmap can successfully recapitulate the spatial organization of multiple organs of human and mouse including tumor microenvironments for multiple cancers in pseudo-space, and reveal molecular determinants of cellular interactions. Further, CSOmap readily simulates perturbation of genes or cell types to gain novel biological insights, especially into how immune cells interact in the tumor microenvironment. CSOmap can be a widely applicable tool to interrogate cellular organizations based on scRNA-seq data for various tissues in diverse systems.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0353-2"

Immunotherapies modulate a patient’s immune system to specifically eliminate cancer cells; thus, it is considered a very different approach from classic cancer therapies that usually induce DNA damage to cause cell death in a cell-intrinsic manner. However, recent studies have revealed that classic cancer therapies such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy also elicit antitumor immunity, which plays an essential role in their therapeutic efficacy. The cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) and the downstream effector Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) have been determined to be critical for this interplay. Here, we review the antitumor roles of the cGAS-STING pathway during tumorigenesis, cancer immune surveillance, and cancer therapies.

Antibody drugs, such as anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1, demonstrate obvious advantages such as broad applicability across cancer types and durable clinical response when treatment is effective. However, the overall response rates are still unsatisfying, especially for cancers with low mutational burden. Moreover, adverse effects, such as autoimmune symptoms and tumor hyperprogression, present a significant downside in some clinical applications. These challenges reflect the urgent need to fully understand the basic biology of immune checkpoints. In this review, we discuss regulation of immune checkpoint signaling at multiple levels to provide an overview of our current understanding of checkpoint biology. Topics include the regulation of surface expression levels for known immune checkpoint proteins via surface delivery, internalization, recycling, and degradation. Upon reaching the surface, checkpoints engage in both conventional trans and also cis interactions with ligands to induce signaling and regulate immune responses. Novel therapeutic strategies targeting these pathways in addition to classical checkpoint blockade have recently emerged and been tested in preclinical models, providing new avenues for developing next-generation immunotherapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0343-4"

In addressing frontiers in clinical immunotherapy, we describe two categories of approaches to the design of novel drugs and combination therapies: the first involves direct modification of the tumor, while the second indirectly enhances immunogenicity through alteration of the microenvironment. By systematically addressing the factors that mediate resistance, we are able to identify mechanistically-driven novel approaches to improve immunotherapy outcomes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0337-2"

In a genetically susceptible host, imbalances in microbiota-immunity interactions under defined environmental contexts are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis of a multitude of immune-mediated disorders. Here, we review features of microbiome-immunity crosstalk and their roles in health and disease, while providing examples of molecular mechanisms orchestrating these interactions in the intestine and extra-intestinal organs. We highlight aspects of the current knowledge, challenges and limitations in achieving causal understanding of host immune-microbiome interactions, as well as their impact on immune-mediated diseases, and discuss how these insights may translate towards future development of microbiome-targeted therapeutic interventions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0332-7"
"cr","Innate lymphoid cells control signaling circuits to regulate tissue-specific immunity","The multifaceted organization of the immune system involves not only patrolling lymphocytes that constantly monitor antigen-presenting cells in secondary lymphoid organs but also immune cells that establish permanent tissue-residency. The integration in the respective tissue and the adaption to the organ milieu enable tissue-resident cells to establish signaling circuits with parenchymal cells to coordinate immune responses and maintain tissue homeostasis. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are tissue-resident innate immune cells that have a similar functional diversity to T cells including lineage-specifying transcription factors that drive certain effector programs. Since their formal discovery 10 years ago, it has become clear that ILCs are present in almost every tissue but strongly enriched at barrier surfaces, where they regulate immunity to infection, chronic inflammation, and tissue maintenance. In this context, recent research has identified ILCs as key in orchestrating tissue homeostasis through their ability to sustain bidirectional interactions with epithelial cells, neurons, stromal cells, adipocytes, and many other tissue-resident cells. In this review, we provide a comprehensive discussion of recent studies that define the development and heterogeneity of ILC populations and their impact on innate and adaptive immunity. Further, we discuss emerging research on the influence of the nervous system, circadian rhythm, and developmental plasticity on ILC function. Uncovering the signaling circuits that control development and function of ILCs will provide an integrated view on how immune responses in tissues are synchronized with functional relevance far beyond the classical view of the role of the immune system in discrimination between self/non-self and host defense.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0323-8"

Improved resolutions allow identification and placement of secondary structural elements in the majority of the CR components. The two Y complexes in each CR subunit interact with each other and associate with those from flanking subunits, forming a circular scaffold. Within each CR subunit, the Nup358-containing region wraps around the stems of both Y complexes, likely stabilizing the scaffold. Nup205 connects the short arms of the two Y complexes and associates with the stem of a neighboring Y complex. The Nup214-containing region uses an extended coiled-coil to link Nup85 of the two Y complexes and protrudes into the axial pore of the NPC.

"cr","Transcriptional and epigenetic basis of Treg cell development and function: its genetic anomalies or variations in autoimmune diseases","Naturally arising regulatory CD4+ T (Treg) cells, which specifically express the transcription factor FoxP3 in the nucleus and CD25 and CTLA-4 on the cell surface, are a T-cell subpopulation specialized for immune suppression, playing a key role in maintaining immunological self-tolerance and homeostasis. FoxP3 is required for Treg function, especially for its suppressive activity. However, FoxP3 expression per se is not necessary for Treg cell lineage commitment in the thymus and insufficient for full Treg-type gene expression in mature Treg cells. It is Treg-specific epigenetic changes such as CpG demethylation and histone modification that can confer a stable and heritable pattern of Treg type gene expression on developing Treg cells in a FoxP3-independent manner. Anomalies in the formation of Treg-specific epigenome, in particular, Treg-specific super-enhancers, which largely include Treg-specific DNA demethylated regions, are indeed able to cause autoimmune diseases in rodents. Furthermore, in humans, single nucleotide polymorphisms in Treg-specific DNA demethylated regions associated with Treg signature genes, such as IL2RA (CD25) and CTLA4, can affect the development and function of naïve Treg cells rather than effector T cells. Such genetic variations are therefore causative of polygenic common autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis via affecting endogenous natural Treg cells. These findings on the transcription factor network with FoxP3 at a key position as well as Treg-specific epigenetic landscape facilitate our understanding of Treg cell development and function, and can be exploited to prepare functionally stable FoxP3-expressing Treg cells from antigen-specific conventional T cells to treat autoimmune diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0324-7"

However, how tumor infiltrating ILCs modulate tumor development and progression is unclear. Here we profiled tumor infiltrating ILCs during colorectal cancer (CRC) progression by single-cell RNA sequencing. We identified six clusters of tumor infiltrating ILCs with unique features. ILC1s expressed inhibitory receptors and underwent inhibitory functional conversion at the late stage of CRC. ILC2s were classified into three subsets (called ILC2-A, -B, -C), of which ILC2-C subset could facilitate tumor progression. HS3ST1 and PD1 were highly expressed in ILC2s of late stage CRC tumors and deficiency of HS3ST1 or PD1 in ILC2s suppressed tumor growth. Moreover, ILC3s transdifferentiated into ILCregs during CRC progression and ILCregs promoted tumor growth. Of note, TGF-β signaling initiated the conversion of ILC3s to ILCregs and blockade of TGF-β signaling could disrupt the ILCreg transdifferentiation and inhibited tumor growth. Thus, intervention of ILC conversions might be a potential strategy for CRC immunotherapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0312-y"
"cr","Molecular architecture of the luminal ring of the Xenopus laevis nuclear pore complex","The nuclear pore complex (NPC) mediates the flow of substances between the nucleus and cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. Here we report the cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) structure of the luminal ring (LR) of the NPC from Xenopus laevis oocyte. The observed key structural features of the LR are independently confirmed by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis. The LR comprises eight butterfly-shaped subunits, each containing two symmetric wings. Each wing consists of four elongated, tubular protomers. Within the LR subunit, the eight protomers form a Finger domain, which directly contacts the fusion between the inner and outer nuclear membranes and a Grid domain, which serves as a rigid base for the Finger domain. Two neighboring LR subunits interact with each other through the lateral edges of their wings to constitute a Bumper domain, which displays two major conformations and appears to cushion neighboring NPCs. Our study reveals previously unknown features of the LR and potentially explains the elastic property of the NPC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0320-y"

The massive population-based human genetics is crucial for the precise prevention and intervention of metabolic disorders. The China Metabolic Analytics Project (ChinaMAP) is based on cohort studies across diverse regions and ethnic groups with metabolic phenotypic data in China. Here, we describe the centralized analysis of the deep whole genome sequencing data and the genetic bases of metabolic traits in 10,588 individuals from the ChinaMAP. The frequency spectrum of variants, population structure, pathogenic variants and novel genomic characteristics were analyzed. The individual genetic evaluations of Mendelian diseases, nutrition and drug metabolism, and traits of blood glucose and BMI were integrated.

"cr","Regulation of sister chromatid cohesion by nuclear PD-L1","Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1 or B7-H1) is well known for its role in immune checkpoint regulation, but its function inside the tumor cells has rarely been explored. Here we report that nuclear PD-L1 is important for cancer cell sister chromatid cohesion. We found that depletion of PD-L1 suppresses cancer cell proliferation, colony formation in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo in immune-deficient NSG mice independent of its role in immune checkpoint. Specifically, PD-L1 functions as a subunit of the cohesin complex, and its deficiency leads to formation of multinucleated cells and causes a defect in sister chromatid cohesion. Mechanistically, PD-L1 compensates for the loss of Sororin, whose expression is suppressed in cancer cells overexpressing PD-L1. PD-L1 competes with Wing Apart-Like (WAPL) for binding to PDS5B, and secures proper sister chromatid cohesion and segregation. Our findings suggest an important role for nuclear PD-L1 in cancer cells independent of its function in immune checkpoint.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0315-8"

"cr","Elimination of senescent cells by β-galactosidase-targeted prodrug attenuates inflammation and restores physical function in aged mice","Cellular senescence, a persistent state of cell cycle arrest, accumulates in aged organisms, contributes to tissue dysfunction, and drives age-related phenotypes. The clearance of senescent cells is expected to decrease chronic, low-grade inflammation and improve tissue repair capacity, thus attenuating the decline of physical function in aged organisms. However, selective and effective clearance of senescent cells of different cell types has proven challenging. Herein, we developed a prodrug strategy to design a new compound based on the increased activity of lysosomal β-galactosidase (β-gal), a primary characteristic of senescent cells. Our prodrug SSK1 is specifically activated by β-gal and eliminates mouse and human senescent cells independently of senescence inducers and cell types. In aged mice, our compound effectively cleared senescent cells in different tissues, decreased the senescence- and age-associated gene signatures, attenuated low-grade local and systemic inflammation, and restored physical function. Our results demonstrate that lysosomal β-gal can be effectively leveraged to selectively eliminate senescent cells, providing a novel strategy to develop anti-aging interventions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0314-9"
"cr","s-HBEGF/SIRT1 circuit-dictated crosstalk between vascular endothelial cells and keratinocytes mediates sorafenib-induced hand–foot skin reaction that can be reversed by nicotinamide","Hand–foot skin reaction (HFSR), among the most significant adverse effects of sorafenib, has been limiting the clinical benefits of this frontline drug in treating various malignant tumors. The mechanism underlying such toxicity remains poorly understood, hence the absence of effective intervention strategies. In the present study, we show that vascular endothelial cells are the primary cellular target of sorafenib-induced HFSR wherein soluble heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (s-HBEGF) mediates the crosstalk between vascular endothelial cells and keratinocytes. Mechanistically, s-HBEGF released from vascular endothelial cells activates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on keratinocytes and promotes the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2), which stabilizes sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an essential keratinization inducer, and ultimately gives rise to HFSR. The administration of s-HBEGF in vivo could sufficiently induce hyper-keratinization without sorafenib treatment. Furthermore, we report that HBEGF neutralization antibody, Sirt1 knockdown, and a classic SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide could all significantly reduce the sorafenib-induced HFSR in the mouse model. It is noteworthy that nicotinic acid, a prodrug of nicotinamide, could substantially reverse the sorafenib-induced HFSR in ten patients in a preliminary clinical study. Collectively, our findings reveal the mechanism of vascular endothelial cell-promoted keratinization in keratinocytes and provide a potentially promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of sorafenib-induced HFSR.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0309-6"

However, the evolutionary mechanisms of social hierarchy are still unknown in amniotes. Here we developed a new method and performed a genome-wide screening for identifying regions with accelerated evolution in the ancestral lineage of placental mammals, where mammalian social hierarchies might have initially evolved. Then functional analyses were conducted for the most accelerated region designated as placental-accelerated sequence 1 (PAS1, P = 3.15 × 10−18). Multiple pieces of evidence show that PAS1 is an enhancer of the transcription factor gene Lhx2 involved in brain development. PAS1s isolated from various amniotes showed different cis-regulatory activity in vitro, and affected the expression of Lhx2 differently in the nervous system of mouse embryos. PAS1 knock-out mice lack social stratification. PAS1 knock-in mouse models demonstrate that PAS1s determine the social dominance and subordinate of adult mice, and that social ranks could even be turned over by mutated PAS1. All homozygous mutant mice had normal huddled sleeping behavior, motor coordination and strength. Therefore, PAS1-Lhx2 modulates social hierarchies and is essential for establishing social stratification in amniotes, and positive Darwinian selection on PAS1 plays pivotal roles in the occurrence of mammalian social hierarchies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0308-7"
"cr","Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 (previously 2019-nCoV) infection by a highly potent pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor targeting its spike protein that harbors a high capacity to mediate membrane fusion","The recent outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan, China has posed a serious threat to global public health. To develop specific anti-coronavirus therapeutics and prophylactics, the molecular mechanism that underlies viral infection must first be defined. Therefore, we herein established a SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein-mediated cell–cell fusion assay and found that SARS-CoV-2 showed a superior plasma membrane fusion capacity compared to that of SARS-CoV. We solved the X-ray crystal structure of six-helical bundle (6-HB) core of the HR1 and HR2 domains in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein S2 subunit, revealing that several mutated amino acid residues in the HR1 domain may be associated with enhanced interactions with the HR2 domain. We previously developed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor, EK1, which targeted the HR1 domain and could inhibit infection by divergent human coronaviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Here we generated a series of lipopeptides derived from EK1 and found that EK1C4 was the most potent fusion inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated membrane fusion and pseudovirus infection with IC50s of 1.3 and 15.8 nM, about 241- and 149-fold more potent than the original EK1 peptide, respectively. EK1C4 was also highly effective against membrane fusion and infection of other human coronavirus pseudoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as SARSr-CoVs, and potently inhibited the replication of 5 live human coronaviruses examined, including SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal application of EK1C4 before or after challenge with HCoV-OC43 protected mice from infection, suggesting that EK1C4 could be used for prevention and treatment of infection by the currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging SARSr-CoVs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0305-x"
"cr","Embryonic endothelial evolution towards first hematopoietic stem cells revealed by single-cell transcriptomic and functional analyses","Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in adults are believed to be born from hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) in mid-gestational embryos. Due to the rare and transient nature, the HSC-competent HECs have never been stringently identified and accurately captured, let alone their genuine vascular precursors. Here, we first used high-precision single-cell transcriptomics to unbiasedly examine the relevant EC populations at continuous developmental stages with intervals of 0.5 days from embryonic day (E) 9.5 to E11.0. As a consequence, we transcriptomically identified two molecularly different arterial EC populations and putative HSC-primed HECs, whose number peaked at E10.0 and sharply decreased thereafter, in the dorsal aorta of the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. Combining computational prediction and in vivo functional validation, we precisely captured HSC-competent HECs by the newly constructed Neurl3-EGFP reporter mouse model, and realized the enrichment further by a combination of surface markers (Procr+Kit+CD44+, PK44). Surprisingly, the endothelial-hematopoietic dual potential was rarely but reliably witnessed in the cultures of single HECs. Noteworthy, primitive vascular ECs from E8.0 experienced two-step fate choices to become HSC-primed HECs, namely an initial arterial fate choice followed by a hemogenic fate conversion. This finding resolves several previously observed contradictions. Taken together, comprehensive understanding of endothelial evolutions and molecular programs underlying HSC-primed HEC specification in vivo will facilitate future investigations directing HSC production in vitro.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0300-2"
"cr","Signaling networks in immunometabolism","Adaptive immunity is essential for pathogen and tumor eradication, but may also trigger uncontrolled or pathological inflammation. T cell receptor, co-stimulatory and cytokine signals coordinately dictate specific signaling networks that trigger the activation and functional programming of T cells. In addition, cellular metabolism promotes T cell responses and is dynamically regulated through the interplay of serine/threonine kinases, immunological cues and nutrient signaling networks. In this review, we summarize the upstream regulators and signaling effectors of key serine/threonine kinase-mediated signaling networks, including PI3K–AGC kinases, mTOR and LKB1–AMPK pathways that regulate metabolism, especially in T cells. We also provide our perspectives about the pending questions and clinical applicability of immunometabolic signaling. Understanding the regulators and effectors of immunometabolic signaling networks may uncover therapeutic targets to modulate metabolic programming and T cell responses in human disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0301-1"

"cr","Toward targeting inflammasomes: insights into their regulation and activation","Inflammasomes are multi-component signaling complexes critical to the initiation of pyroptotic cell death in response to invading pathogens and cellular damage. A number of innate immune receptors have been reported to serve as inflammasome sensors. Activation of these sensors leads to the proteolytic activation of caspase-1, a proinflammatory caspase responsible for the cleavage of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and interleukin-18 and the effector of pyroptotic cell death, gasdermin D. Though crucial to the innate immune response to infection, dysregulation of inflammasome activation can lead to the development of inflammatory diseases, neurodegeneration, and cancer. Therefore, clinical interest in the modulation of inflammasome activation is swiftly growing. As such, it is imperative to develop a mechanistic understanding of the regulation of these complexes. In this review, we divide the regulation of inflammasome activation into three parts. We discuss the transcriptional regulation of inflammasome components and related proteins, the post-translational mechanisms of inflammasome activation, and advances in the understanding of the structural basis of inflammasome activation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0295-8"
"cr","Targeting immunometabolism as an anti-inflammatory strategy","The growing field of immunometabolism has taught us how metabolic cellular reactions and processes not only provide a means to generate ATP and biosynthetic precursors, but are also a way of controlling immunity and inflammation. Metabolic reprogramming of immune cells is essential for both inflammatory as well as anti-inflammatory responses. Four anti-inflammatory therapies, DMF, Metformin, Methotrexate and Rapamycin all work by affecting metabolism and/or regulating or mimicking endogenous metabolites with anti-inflammatory effects. Evidence is emerging for the targeting of specific metabolic events as a strategy to limit inflammation in different contexts. Here we discuss these recent developments and speculate on the prospect of targeting immunometabolism in the effort to develop novel anti-inflammatory therapeutics. As accumulating evidence for roles of an intricate and elaborate network of metabolic processes, including lipid, amino acid and nucleotide metabolism provides key focal points for developing new therapies, we here turn our attention to glycolysis and the TCA cycle to provide examples of how metabolic intermediates and enzymes can provide potential novel therapeutic targets.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0291-z"
"cr","The PIWI protein Aubergine recruits eIF3 to activate translation in the germ plasm","Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and PIWI proteins are essential in germ cells to repress transposons and regulate mRNAs. In Drosophila, piRNAs bound to the PIWI protein Aubergine (Aub) are transferred maternally to the embryo and regulate maternal mRNA stability through two opposite roles. They target mRNAs by incomplete base pairing, leading to their destabilization in the soma and stabilization in the germ plasm. Here, we report a function of Aub in translation. Aub is required for translational activation of nanos mRNA, a key determinant of the germ plasm. Aub physically interacts with the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) and the translation initiation factor eIF3. Polysome gradient profiling reveals the role of Aub at the initiation step of translation. In the germ plasm, PABP and eIF3d assemble in foci that surround Aub-containing germ granules, and Aub acts with eIF3d to promote nanos translation. These results identify translational activation as a new mode of mRNA regulation by Aub, highlighting the versatility of PIWI proteins in mRNA regulation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0294-9"
"cr","Meningeal lymphatic vessels regulate brain tumor drainage and immunity","Recent studies have shown that meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs), which are located both dorsally and basally beneath the skull, provide a route for draining macromolecules and trafficking immune cells from the central nervous system (CNS) into cervical lymph nodes (CLNs), and thus represent a potential therapeutic target for treating neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. However, the roles of MLVs in brain tumor drainage and immunity remain unexplored. Here we show that dorsal MLVs undergo extensive remodeling in mice with intracranial gliomas or metastatic melanomas. RNA-seq analysis of MLV endothelial cells revealed changes in the gene sets involved in lymphatic remodeling, fluid drainage, as well as inflammatory and immunological responses. Disruption of dorsal MLVs alone impaired intratumor fluid drainage and the dissemination of brain tumor cells to deep CLNs (dCLNs). Notably, the dendritic cell (DC) trafficking from intracranial tumor tissues to dCLNs decreased in mice with defective dorsal MLVs, and increased in mice with enhanced dorsal meningeal lymphangiogenesis. Strikingly, disruption of dorsal MLVs alone, without affecting basal MLVs or nasal LVs, significantly reduced the efficacy of combined anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 checkpoint therapy in striatal tumor models. Furthermore, mice bearing tumors overexpressing VEGF-C displayed a better response to anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 combination therapy, and this was abolished by CCL21/CCR7 blockade, suggesting that VEGF-C potentiates checkpoint therapy via the CCL21/CCR7 pathway. Together, the results of our study not only demonstrate the functional aspects of MLVs as classic lymphatic vasculature, but also highlight that they are essential in generating an efficient immune response against brain tumors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0287-8"
"cr","Mammalian ALKBH1 serves as an N6-mA demethylase of unpairing DNA","N6-methyladenine (N6-mA) of DNA is an emerging epigenetic mark in mammalian genome. Levels of N6-mA undergo drastic fluctuation during early embryogenesis, indicative of active regulation. Here we show that the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase ALKBH1 functions as a nuclear eraser of N6-mA in unpairing regions (e.g., SIDD, Stress-Induced DNA Double Helix Destabilization regions) of mammalian genomes. Enzymatic profiling studies revealed that ALKBH1 prefers bubbled or bulged DNAs as substrate, instead of single-stranded (ss-) or double-stranded (ds-) DNAs. Structural studies of ALKBH1 revealed an unexpected “stretch-out” conformation of its “Flip1” motif, a conserved element that usually bends over catalytic center to facilitate substrate base flipping in other DNA demethylases. Thus, lack of a bending “Flip1” explains the observed preference of ALKBH1 for unpairing substrates, in which the flipped N6-mA is primed for catalysis. Co-crystal structural studies of ALKBH1 bound to a 21-mer bulged DNA explained the need of both flanking duplexes and a flipped base for recognition and catalysis. Key elements (e.g., an ALKBH1-specific α1 helix) as well as residues contributing to structural integrity and catalytic activity were validated by structure-based mutagenesis studies. Furthermore, ssDNA-seq and DIP-seq analyses revealed significant co-occurrence of base unpairing regions with N6-mA in mouse genome. Collectively, our biochemical, structural and genomic studies suggest that ALKBH1 is an important DNA demethylase that regulates genome N6-mA turnover of unpairing regions associated with dynamic chromosome regulation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0237-5"
"cr","Cryo-EM structures of PAC1 receptor reveal ligand binding mechanism","The pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type I receptor (PAC1R) belongs to the secretin receptor family and is widely distributed in the central neural system and peripheral organs. Abnormal activation of the receptor mediates trigeminovascular activation and sensitization, which is highly related to migraine, making PAC1R a potential therapeutic target. Elucidation of PAC1R activation mechanism would benefit discovery of therapeutic drugs for neuronal disorders. PAC1R activity is governed by pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP), known as a major vasodilator neuropeptide, and maxadilan, a native peptide from the sand fly, which is also capable of activating the receptor with similar potency. These peptide ligands have divergent sequences yet initiate convergent PAC1R activity. It is of interest to understand the mechanism of PAC1R ligand recognition and receptor activity regulation through structural biology. Here we report two near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structures of PAC1R activated by PACAP38 or maxadilan, providing structural insights into two distinct ligand binding modes. The structures illustrate flexibility of the extracellular domain (ECD) for ligands with distinct conformations, where ECD accommodates ligands in different orientations while extracellular loop 1 (ECL1) protrudes to further anchor the ligand bound in the orthosteric site. By structure-guided molecular modeling and mutagenesis, we tested residues in the ligand-binding pockets and identified clusters of residues that are critical for receptor activity. The structures reported here for the first time elucidate the mechanism of specificity and flexibility of ligand recognition and binding for PAC1R, and provide insights toward the design of therapeutic molecules targeting PAC1R.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0280-2"
"cr","Refined spatial temporal epigenomic profiling reveals intrinsic connection between PRDM9-mediated H3K4me3 and the fate of double-stranded breaks","Meiotic recombination is initiated by the formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs), which are repaired as either crossovers (COs) or noncrossovers (NCOs). In most mammals, PRDM9-mediated H3K4me3 controls the nonrandom distribution of DSBs; however, both the timing and mechanism of DSB fate control remain largely undetermined. Here, we generated comprehensive epigenomic profiles of synchronized mouse spermatogenic cells during meiotic prophase I, revealing spatiotemporal and functional relationships between epigenetic factors and meiotic recombination. We find that PRDM9-mediated H3K4me3 at DSB hotspots, coinciding with H3K27ac and H3K36me3, is intimately connected with the fate of the DSB. Our data suggest that the fate decision is likely made at the time of DSB formation: earlier formed DSBs occupy more open chromatins and are much more competent to proceed to a CO fate. Our work highlights an intrinsic connection between PRDM9-mediated H3K4me3 and the fate decision of DSBs, and provides new insight into the control of CO homeostasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0281-1"
"cr","Remdesivir and chloroquine effectively inhibit the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) in vitro","In December 2019, a novel pneumonia caused by a previously unknown pathogen emerged in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China. The initial cases were linked to exposures in a seafood market in Wuhan.1 As of January 27, 2020, the Chinese authorities reported 2835 confirmed cases in mainland China, including 81 deaths. Additionally, 19 confirmed cases were identified in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and 39 imported cases were identified in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, United States, Vietnam, Singapore, Nepal, France, Australia and Canada. The pathogen was soon identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is closely related to sever acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV).2 Currently, there is no specific treatment against the new virus. Therefore, identifying effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed.An efficient approach to drug discovery is to test whether the existing antiviral drugs are effective in treating related viral infections. The 2019-nCoV belongs to Betacoronavirus which also contains SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). Several drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon, lopinavir-ritonavir, corticosteroids, have been used in patients with SARS or MERS, although the efficacy of some drugs remains controversial.3 In this study, we evaluated the antiviral efficiency of five FAD-approved drugs including ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, chloroquine and two well-known broad-spectrum antiviral drugs remdesivir (GS-5734) and favipiravir (T-705) against a clinical isolate of 2019-nCoV in vitro.Standard assays were carried out to measure the effects of these compounds on the cytotoxicity, virus yield and infection rates of 2019-nCoVs. Firstly, the cytotoxicity of the candidate compounds in Vero E6 cells (ATCC-1586) was determined by the CCK8 assay. Then, Vero E6 cells were infected with nCoV-2019BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/20192 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.05 in the presence of varying concentrations of the test drugs. DMSO was used in the controls. Efficacies were evaluated by quantification of viral copy numbers in the cell supernatant via quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and confirmed with visualization of virus nucleoprotein (NP) expression through immunofluorescence microscopy at 48 h post infection (p.i.) (cytopathic effect was not obvious at this time point of infection). Among the seven tested drugs, high concentrations of three nucleoside analogs including ribavirin (half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) = 109.50 μM, half-cytotoxic concentration (CC50) > 400 μM, selectivity index (SI) > 3.65), penciclovir (EC50 = 95.96 μM, CC50 > 400 μM, SI > 4.17) and favipiravir (EC50 = 61.88 μM, CC50 > 400 μM, SI > 6.46) were required to reduce the viral infection (Fig. 1a and Supplementary information, Fig. S1). However, favipiravir has been shown to be 100% effective in protecting mice against Ebola virus challenge, although its EC50 value in Vero E6 cells was as high as 67 μM,4 suggesting further in vivo studies are recommended to evaluate this antiviral nucleoside. Nafamostat, a potent inhibitor of MERS-CoV, which prevents membrane fusion, was inhibitive against the 2019-nCoV infection (EC50 = 22.50 μM, CC50 > 100 μM, SI > 4.44). Nitazoxanide, a commercial antiprotozoal agent with an antiviral potential against a broad range of viruses including human and animal coronaviruses, inhibited the 2019-nCoV at a low-micromolar concentration (EC50 = 2.12 μM; CC50 > 35.53 μM; SI > 16.76). Further in vivo evaluation of this drug against 2019-nCoV infection is recommended. Notably, two compounds remdesivir (EC50 = 0.77 μM; CC50 > 100 μM; SI > 129.87) and chloroquine (EC50 = 1.13 μM; CC50 > 100 μM, SI > 88.50) potently blocked virus infection at low-micromolar concentration and showed high SI (Fig. 1a, b).Fig. 1: The antiviral activities of the test drugs against 2019-nCoV in vitro.a Vero E6 cells were infected with 2019-nCoV at an MOI of 0.05 in the treatment of different doses of the indicated antivirals for 48 h. The viral yield in the cell supernatant was then quantified by qRT-PCR. Cytotoxicity of these drugs to Vero E6 cells was measured by CCK-8 assays. The left and right Y-axis of the graphs represent mean % inhibition of virus yield and cytotoxicity of the drugs, respectively. The experiments were done in triplicates. b Immunofluorescence microscopy of virus infection upon treatment of remdesivir and chloroquine. Virus infection and drug treatment were performed as mentioned above.

The nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. Bars, 100 μm. c and d Time-of-addition experiment of remdesivir and chloroquine. For “Full-time” treatment, Vero E6 cells were pre-treated with the drugs for 1 h, and virus was then added to allow attachment for 2 h. Afterwards, the virus–drug mixture was removed, and the cells were cultured with drug-containing medium until the end of the experiment. For “Entry” treatment, the drugs were added to the cells for 1 h before viral attachment, and at 2 h p.i., the virus–drug mixture was replaced with fresh culture medium and maintained till the end of the experiment. For “Post-entry” experiment, drugs were added at 2 h p.i., and maintained until the end of the experiment. For all the experimental groups, cells were infected with 2019-nCoV at an MOI of 0.05, and virus yield in the infected cell supernatants was quantified by qRT-PCR c and NP expression in infected cells was analyzed by Western blot d at 14 h p.i.Full size imageRemdesivir has been recently recognized as a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA viruses (including SARS/MERS-CoV5) infection in cultured cells, mice and nonhuman primate (NHP) models. It is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus infection.6 Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue, which incorporates into nascent viral RNA chains and results in pre-mature termination.7 Our time-of-addition assay showed remdesivir functioned at a stage post virus entry (Fig. 1c, d), which is in agreement with its putative anti-viral mechanism as a nucleotide analogue. Warren et al. showed that in NHP model, intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg dose of remdesivir resulted in concomitant persistent levels of its active form in the blood (10 μM) and conferred 100% protection against Ebola virus infection.7 Our data showed that EC90 value of remdesivir against 2019-nCoV in Vero E6 cells was 1.76 μM, suggesting its working concentration is likely to be achieved in NHP. Our preliminary data (Supplementary information, Fig. S2) showed that remdesivir also inhibited virus infection efficiently in a human cell line (human liver cancer Huh-7 cells), which is sensitive to 2019-nCoV.2Chloroquine, a widely-used anti-malarial and autoimmune disease drug, has recently been reported as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug.8,9 Chloroquine is known to block virus infection by increasing endosomal pH required for virus/cell fusion, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV.10 Our time-of-addition assay demonstrated that chloroquine functioned at both entry, and at post-entry stages of the 2019-nCoV infection in Vero E6 cells (Fig. 1c, d). Besides its antiviral activity, chloroquine has an immune-modulating activity, which may synergistically enhance its antiviral effect in vivo. Chloroquine is widely distributed in the whole body, including lung, after oral administration. The EC90 value of chloroquine against the 2019-nCoV in Vero E6 cells was 6.90 μM, which can be clinically achievable as demonstrated in the plasma of rheumatoid arthritis patients who received 500 mg administration.11 Chloroquine is a cheap and a safe drug that has been used for more than 70 years and, therefore, it is potentially clinically applicable against the 2019-nCoV.Our findings reveal that remdesivir and chloroquine are highly effective in the control of 2019-nCoV infection in vitro. Since these compounds have been used in human patients with a safety track record and shown to be effective against various ailments, we suggest that they should be assessed in human patients suffering from the novel coronavirus disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0"
"cr","The yin and yang of co-inhibitory receptors: toward anti-tumor immunity without autoimmunity","Co-inhibitory receptors are important regulators of T-cell function that define the balance between tolerance and autoimmunity. The immune regulatory function of co-inhibitory receptors, including CTLA-4, PD-1, TIM-3, TIGIT, and LAG-3, was first discovered in the setting of autoimmune disease models, in which their blockade or deficiency resulted in induction or exacerbation of the disease. Later on, co-inhibitory receptors on lymphocytes have also been found to influence outcomes in tumor and chronic viral infection settings. These receptors suppress T-cell function in the tumor microenvironment (TME), thereby making the T cells dysfunctional. Based on this observation, blockade of co-inhibitory receptors (also known as checkpoint molecules) has emerged as a successful treatment option for a number of human cancers. However, severe autoimmune-like side effects limit the use of therapeutics that block individual or combinations of co-inhibitory receptors for cancer treatment. In this review we provide an overview of the role of co-inhibitory receptors in autoimmunity and anti-tumor immunity.

"cr","Dosage effect of multiple genes accounts for multisystem disorder of myotonic dystrophy type 1","Multisystem manifestations in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) may be due to dosage reduction in multiple genes induced by aberrant expansion of CTG repeats in DMPK, including DMPK, its neighboring genes (SIX5 or DMWD) and downstream MBNL1. However, direct evidence is lacking. Here, we develop a new strategy to generate mice carrying multigene heterozygous mutations to mimic dosage reduction in one step by injection of haploid embryonic stem cells with mutant Dmpk, Six5 and Mbnl1 into oocytes. The triple heterozygous mutant mice exhibit adult-onset DM1 phenotypes. With the additional mutation in Dmwd, the quadruple heterozygous mutant mice recapitulate many major manifestations in congenital DM1. Moreover, muscle stem cells in both models display reduced stemness, providing a unique model for screening small molecules for treatment of DM1. Our results suggest that the complex symptoms of DM1 result from the reduced dosage of multiple genes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0264-2"

"cr","Transferrin plays a central role in coagulation balance by interacting with clotting factors","Coagulation balance is maintained through fine-tuned interactions among clotting factors, whose physiological concentrations vary substantially. In particular, the concentrations of coagulation proteases (pM to nM) are much lower than their natural inactivator antithrombin (AT, ~ 3 μM), suggesting the existence of other coordinators. In the current study, we found that transferrin (normal plasma concentration ~40 μM) interacts with fibrinogen, thrombin, factor XIIa (FXIIa), and AT with different affinity to maintain coagulation balance. Normally, transferrin is sequestered by binding with fibrinogen (normal plasma concentration ~10 μM) at a molar ratio of 4:1. In atherosclerosis, abnormally up-regulated transferrin interacts with and potentiates thrombin/FXIIa and blocks AT’s inactivation effect on coagulation proteases by binding to AT, thus inducing hypercoagulability. In the mouse model, transferrin overexpression aggravated atherosclerosis, whereas transferrin inhibition via shRNA knockdown or treatment with anti-transferrin antibody or designed peptides interfering with transferrin-thrombin/FXIIa interactions alleviated atherosclerosis. Collectively, these findings identify that transferrin is an important clotting regulator and an adjuster in the maintenance of coagulation balance and modifies the coagulation cascade.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0260-6"
"cr","ILF3 is a substrate of SPOP for regulating serine biosynthesis in colorectal cancer","The Serine–Glycine–One-Carbon (SGOC) pathway is pivotal in multiple anabolic processes. Expression levels of SGOC genes are deregulated under tumorigenic conditions, suggesting participation of oncogenes in deregulating the SGOC biosynthetic pathway. However, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we identified that Interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3) is overexpressed in primary CRC patient specimens and correlates with poor prognosis. ILF3 is critical in regulating the SGOC pathway by directly regulating the mRNA stability of SGOC genes, thereby increasing SGOC genes expression and facilitating tumor growth. Mechanistic studies showed that the EGF–MEK–ERK pathway mediates ILF3 phosphorylation, which hinders E3 ligase speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP)-mediated poly-ubiquitination and degradation of ILF3. Significantly, combination of SGOC inhibitor and the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab can hinder the growth of patient-derived xenografts that sustain high ERK-ILF3 levels. Taken together, deregulation of ILF3 via the EGF–ERK signaling plays an important role in systemic serine metabolic reprogramming and confers a predilection toward CRC development. Our findings indicate that clinical evaluation of SGOC inhibitor is warranted for CRC patients with ILF3 overexpression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0257-1"

To date, preferentially reconstituting T lymphopoiesis in vivo from PSCs remains a practical challenge. Here we documented that synergistic and transient expression of Runx1 and Hoxa9 restricted in the time window of endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition and hematopoietic maturation stages in a PSC differentiation scheme (iR9-PSC) in vitro induced preferential generation of engraftable hematopoietic progenitors capable of homing to thymus and developing into mature T cells in primary and secondary immunodeficient recipients. Single-cell transcriptome and functional analyses illustrated the cellular trajectory of T lineage induction from PSCs, unveiling the T-lineage specification determined at as early as hemogenic endothelial cell stage and identifying the bona fide pre-thymic progenitors. The induced T cells distributed normally in central and peripheral lymphoid organs and exhibited abundant TCRαβ repertoire. The regenerative T lymphopoiesis restored immune surveillance in immunodeficient mice. Furthermore, gene-edited iR9-PSCs produced tumor-specific T cells in vivo that effectively eradicated tumor cells. This study provides insight into universal generation of functional and therapeutic T cells from the unlimited and editable PSC source.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0251-7"
"cr","Asymmetric distribution of cytokinins determines root hydrotropism in Arabidopsis thaliana","The phenomenon of plant root tips sensing moisture gradient in soil and growing towards higher water potential is designated as root hydrotropism, which is critical for plants to survive when water is a limited factor. Molecular mechanisms regulating such a fundamental process, however, are largely unknown. Here we report our identification that cytokinins are key signaling molecules directing root growth orientation in a hydrostimulation (moisture gradient) condition. Lower water potential side of the root tip shows more cytokinin response relative to the higher water potential side. Consequently, two cytokinin downstream type-A response regulators, ARR16 and ARR17, were found to be up-regulated at the lower water potential side, causing increased cell division in the meristem zone, which allows the root to bend towards higher water potential side. Genetic analyses indicated that various cytokinin biosynthesis and signaling mutants, including the arr16 arr17 double mutant, are significantly less responsive to hydrostimulation. Consistently, treatments with chemical inhibitors interfering with either cytokinin biosynthesis or cell division completely abolished root hydrotropic response. Asymmetrically induced expression of ARR16 or ARR17 effectively led to root bending in both wild-type and miz1, a previously known hydrotropism-defective mutant. These data demonstrate that asymmetric cytokinin distribution is a primary determinant governing root hydrotropism.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0239-3"

Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we constructed the first genome-scale gene expression landscape covering the entire course of endothelial-to-HSC transition during human embryogenesis. The transcriptomically defined HSC-primed hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) were captured at Carnegie stage (CS) 12–14 in an unbiased way, showing an unambiguous feature of arterial endothelial cells (ECs) with the up-regulation of RUNX1, MYB and ANGPT1. Importantly, subcategorizing CD34+CD45− ECs into a CD44+ population strikingly enriched HECs by over 10-fold. We further mapped the developmental path from arterial ECs via HSC-primed HECs to hematopoietic stem progenitor cells, and revealed a distinct expression pattern of genes that were transiently over-represented upon the hemogenic fate choice of arterial ECs, including EMCN, PROCR and RUNX1T1. We also uncovered another temporally and molecularly distinct intra-embryonic HEC population, which was detected mainly at earlier CS 10 and lacked the arterial feature. Finally, we revealed the cellular components of the putative aortic niche and potential cellular interactions acting on the HSC-primed HECs. The cellular and molecular programs that underlie the generation of the first HSCs from HECs in human embryos, together with the ability to distinguish the HSC-primed HECs from others, will shed light on the strategies for the production of clinically useful HSCs from pluripotent stem cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0228-6"
"cr","Endothelial CDS2 deficiency causes VEGFA-mediated vascular regression and tumor inhibition","The response of endothelial cells to signaling stimulation is critical for vascular morphogenesis, homeostasis and function. Vascular endothelial growth factor-a (VEGFA) has been commonly recognized as a pro-angiogenic factor in vertebrate developmental, physiological and pathological conditions for decades. Here we report a novel finding that genetic ablation of CDP-diacylglycerol synthetase-2 (CDS2), a metabolic enzyme that controls phosphoinositide recycling, switches the output of VEGFA signaling from promoting angiogenesis to unexpectedly inducing vessel regression. Live imaging analysis uncovered the presence of reverse migration of the angiogenic endothelium in cds2 mutant zebrafish upon VEGFA stimulation, and endothelium regression also occurred in postnatal retina and implanted tumor models in mice. In tumor models, CDS2 deficiency enhanced the level of tumor-secreted VEGFA, which in-turn trapped tumors into a VEGFA-induced vessel regression situation, leading to suppression of tumor growth. Mechanistically, VEGFA stimulation reduced phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) availability in the absence of CDS2-controlled-phosphoinositide metabolism, subsequently causing phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3) deficiency and FOXO1 activation to trigger regression of CDS2-null endothelium. Thus, our data indicate that the effect of VEGFA on vasculature is context-dependent and can be converted from angiogenesis to vascular regression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0229-5"
"cr","Sodium oligomannate therapeutically remodels gut microbiota and suppresses gut bacterial amino acids-shaped neuroinflammation to inhibit Alzheimer’s disease progression","Recently, increasing evidence has suggested the association between gut dysbiosis and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression, yet the role of gut microbiota in AD pathogenesis remains obscure. Herein, we provide a potential mechanistic link between gut microbiota dysbiosis and neuroinflammation in AD progression. Using AD mouse models, we discovered that, during AD progression, the alteration of gut microbiota composition leads to the peripheral accumulation of phenylalanine and isoleucine, which stimulates the differentiation and proliferation of pro-inflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) cells. The brain-infiltrated peripheral Th1 immune cells are associated with the M1 microglia activation, contributing to AD-associated neuroinflammation. Importantly, the elevation of phenylalanine and isoleucine concentrations and the increase of Th1 cell frequency in the blood were also observed in two small independent cohorts of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. Furthermore, GV-971, a sodium oligomannate that has demonstrated solid and consistent cognition improvement in a phase 3 clinical trial in China, suppresses gut dysbiosis and the associated phenylalanine/isoleucine accumulation, harnesses neuroinflammation and reverses the cognition impairment. Together, our findings highlight the role of gut dysbiosis-promoted neuroinflammation in AD progression and suggest a novel strategy for AD therapy by remodelling the gut microbiota.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0216-x"
"cr","Sustained Type I interferon signaling as a mechanism of resistance to PD-1 blockade","PD-1 blockade represents a major therapeutic avenue in anticancer immunotherapy. Delineating mechanisms of secondary resistance to this strategy is increasingly important. Here, we identified the deleterious role of signaling via the type I interferon (IFN) receptor in tumor and antigen presenting cells, that induced the expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2), associated with intratumor accumulation of regulatory T cells (Treg) and myeloid cells and acquired resistance to anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Sustained IFNβ transcription was observed in resistant tumors, in turn inducing PD-L1 and NOS2 expression in both tumor and dendritic cells (DC). Whereas PD-L1 was not involved in secondary resistance to anti-PD-1 mAb, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of NOS2 maintained long-term control of tumors by PD-1 blockade, through reduction of Treg and DC activation. Resistance to immunotherapies, including anti-PD-1 mAb in melanoma patients, was also correlated with the induction of a type I IFN signature. Hence, the role of type I IFN in response to PD-1 blockade should be revisited as sustained type I IFN signaling may contribute to resistance to therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0224-x"

Here, we reveal an antibacterial property against Gram-negative bacteria for factors VII, IX and X, three proteins with well-established roles in initiation of the coagulation cascade. These factors exert antibacterial function via their light chains (LCs). Unlike many antibacterial agents that target cell metabolism or the cytoplasmic membrane, the LCs act by hydrolyzing the major components of bacterial outer membrane, lipopolysaccharides, which are crucial for the survival of Gram-negative bacteria. The LC of factor VII exhibits in vitro efficacy towards all Gram-negative bacteria tested, including extensively drug-resistant (XDR) pathogens, at nanomolar concentrations. It is also highly effective in combating XDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii infections in vivo. Through decoding a unique mechanism whereby factors VII, IX and X behave as antimicrobial proteins, this study advances our understanding of the coagulation system in host defense, and suggests that these factors may participate in the pathogenesis of coagulation disorder-related diseases such as sepsis via their dual functions in blood coagulation and resistance to infection. Furthermore, this study may offer new strategies for combating Gram-negative “superbugs”.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0202-3"
"cr","NDUFAB1 confers cardio-protection by enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics through coordination of respiratory complex and supercomplex assembly","The impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetics, often coupled with exaggerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, is a fundamental disease mechanism in organs with a high demand for energy, including the heart. Building a more robust and safer cellular powerhouse holds the promise for protecting these organs in stressful conditions. Here, we demonstrate that NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunit AB1 (NDUFAB1), also known as mitochondrial acyl carrier protein, acts as a powerful cardio-protector by conferring greater capacity and efficiency of mitochondrial energy metabolism. In particular, NDUFAB1 not only serves as a complex I subunit, but also coordinates the assembly of respiratory complexes I, II, and III, and supercomplexes, through regulating iron-sulfur biosynthesis and complex I subunit stability. Cardiac-specific deletion of Ndufab1 in mice caused defective bioenergetics and elevated ROS levels, leading to progressive dilated cardiomyopathy and eventual heart failure and sudden death. Overexpression of Ndufab1 effectively enhanced mitochondrial bioenergetics while limiting ROS production and protected the heart against ischemia-reperfusion injury. Together, our findings identify that NDUFAB1 is a crucial regulator of mitochondrial energy and ROS metabolism through coordinating the assembly of respiratory complexes and supercomplexes, and thus provide a potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of heart failure.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0208-x"

Here, we demonstrate a new reprogramming strategy by mimicking the natural regeneration route, which permits generating expandable hepatic progenitor cells and functionally competent human hepatocytes. Fibroblasts were first induced into human hepatic progenitor-like cells (hHPLCs), which could robustly expand in vitro and efficiently engraft in vivo. Moreover, hHPLCs could be efficiently induced into mature human hepatocytes (hiHeps) in vitro, whose molecular identity highly resembles primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). Most importantly, hiHeps could be generated in large quantity and were functionally competent to replace PHHs for drug-metabolism estimation, toxicity prediction and hepatitis B virus infection modeling. Our results highlight the advantages of the progenitor stage for successful lineage reprogramming. This strategy is promising for generating other mature human cell types by lineage reprogramming.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0196-x"
"cr","Hijacking antibody-induced CTLA-4 lysosomal degradation for safer and more effective cancer immunotherapy","It remains unclear why the clinically used anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, popularly called checkpoint inhibitors, have severe immunotherapy-related adverse effects (irAEs) and yet suboptimal cancer immunotherapeutic effects (CITE). Here we report that while irAE-prone Ipilimumab and TremeIgG1 rapidly direct cell surface CTLA-4 for lysosomal degradation, the non-irAE-prone antibodies we generated, HL12 or HL32, dissociate from CTLA-4 after endocytosis and allow CTLA-4 recycling to cell surface by the LRBA-dependent mechanism. Disrupting CTLA-4 recycling results in robust CTLA-4 downregulation by all anti-CTLA-4 antibodies and confers toxicity to a non-irAE-prone anti-CTLA-4 mAb. Conversely, increasing the pH sensitivity of TremeIgG1 by introducing designed tyrosine-to-histidine mutations prevents antibody-triggered lysosomal CTLA-4 downregulation and dramatically attenuates irAE. Surprisingly, by avoiding CTLA-4 downregulation and due to their increased bioavailability, pH-sensitive anti-CTLA-4 antibodies are more effective in intratumor regulatory T-cell depletion and rejection of large established tumors. Our data establish a new paradigm for cancer research that allows for abrogating irAE while increasing CITE of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0184-1"
"cr","Intestinal lysozyme liberates Nod1 ligands from microbes to direct insulin trafficking in pancreatic beta cells","Long-range communication between intestinal symbiotic bacteria and extra-intestinal organs can occur through circulating bacterial signal molecules, through neural circuits, or through cytokines or hormones from host cells. Here we report that Nod1 ligands derived from intestinal bacteria act as signal molecules and directly modulate insulin trafficking in pancreatic beta cells. The cytosolic peptidoglycan receptor Nod1 and its downstream adapter Rip2 are required for insulin trafficking in beta cells in a cell-autonomous manner. Mechanistically, upon recognizing cognate ligands, Nod1 and Rip2 localize to insulin vesicles, recruiting Rab1a to direct insulin trafficking through the cytoplasm. Importantly, intestinal lysozyme liberates Nod1 ligands into the circulation, thus enabling long-range communication between intestinal microbes and islets. The intestine-islet crosstalk bridged by Nod1 ligands modulates host glucose tolerance. Our study defines a new type of inter-organ communication based on circulating bacterial signal molecules, which has broad implications for understanding the mutualistic relationship between microbes and host.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0190-3"
"cr","AIF-regulated oxidative phosphorylation supports lung cancer development","Cancer is a major and still increasing cause of death in humans. Most cancer cells have a fundamentally different metabolic profile from that of normal tissue. This shift away from mitochondrial ATP synthesis via oxidative phosphorylation towards a high rate of glycolysis, termed Warburg effect, has long been recognized as a paradigmatic hallmark of cancer, supporting the increased biosynthetic demands of tumor cells. Here we show that deletion of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) in a KrasG12D-driven mouse lung cancer model resulted in a marked survival advantage, with delayed tumor onset and decreased malignant progression. Mechanistically, Aif deletion leads to oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficiency and a switch in cellular metabolism towards glycolysis in non-transformed pneumocytes and at early stages of tumor development. Paradoxically, although Aif-deficient cells exhibited a metabolic Warburg profile, this bioenergetic change resulted in a growth disadvantage of KrasG12D-driven as well as Kras wild-type lung cancer cells. Cell-autonomous re-expression of both wild-type and mutant AIF (displaying an intact mitochondrial, but abrogated apoptotic function) in Aif-knockout KrasG12D mice restored OXPHOS and reduced animal survival to the same level as AIF wild-type mice. In patients with non-small cell lung cancer, high AIF expression was associated with poor prognosis. These data show that AIF-regulated mitochondrial respiration and OXPHOS drive the progression of lung cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0181-4"
"cr","Structural basis of allosteric regulation of Tel1/ATM kinase","ATM/Tel1 is an apical kinase that orchestrates the multifaceted DNA damage response. Mutations of ATM/Tel1 are associated with ataxia telangiectasia syndrome. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of symmetric dimer (4.1 Å) and asymmetric dimer (4.3 Å) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tel1. In the symmetric state, the side chains in Tel1 C-terminus (residues 1129–2787) are discernible and an atomic model is built. The substrate binding groove is completely embedded in the symmetric dimer by the intramolecular PRD and intermolecular LID domains. Point mutations in these domains sensitize the S. cerevisiae cells to DNA damage agents and hinder Tel1 activation due to reduced binding affinity for its activator Xrs2/Nbs1. In the asymmetric state, one monomer becomes more compact in two ways: the kinase N-lobe moves down and the Spiral of α-solenoid moves upwards, which resemble the conformational changes observed in active mTOR. The accessibility of the activation loop correlates with the synergistic conformational disorders in the TRD1-TRD2 linker, FATC and PRD domains, where critical post-translational modifications and activating mutations are coincidently condensed. This study reveals a tunable allosteric network in ATM/Tel1, which is important for substrate recognition, recruitment and efficient phosphorylation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0176-1"
"cr","Complement C3 activation regulates the production of tRNA-derived fragments Gly-tRFs and promotes alcohol-induced liver injury and steatosis","Complement is known to play a role in alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, thereby constraining the development of a rational approach for therapeutic intervention in the complement system. C3 deficiency has been shown to impart protective effects against ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Here we demonstrate a protection effect in wild-type mice by treatment with CR2-Crry, a specific inhibitor of C3 activation. The expression of glycine transfer (t) RNA-derived fragments (Gly-tRFs) is upregulated in ethanol-fed mice and inhibition of Gly-tRFs in vivo decreases chronic ethanol feeding-induced hepatosteatosis without affecting inflammation. The expression of Gly-tRF was downregulated in C3-deficient or CR2-Crry-treated mice, but not in C5-deficient mice; Gly-tRF expression was restored by the C3 activation products C3a or Asp (C3a-des-Arg) via the regulation of CYP2E1. Transcriptome profiling of hepatic tissues showed that Gly-tRF inhibitors upregulate the expression of sirtuin1 (Sirt1) and subsequently affect downstream lipogenesis and β-oxidation pathways. Mechanistically, Gly-tRF interacts with AGO3 to downregulate Sirt1 expression via sequence complementarity in the 3′ UTR. Notably, the expression levels of C3d, CYP2E1 and Gly-tRF are upregulated, whereas Sirt1 is decreased in AFLD patients compared to healthy controls. Collectively, our findings suggest that C3 activation products contribute to hepatosteatosis by regulating the expression of Gly-tRF. Complement inhibition at the C3 activation step and treatment with Gly-tRF inhibitors may be potential and precise therapeutic approaches for AFLD.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0175-2"
"cr","Pioneering function of Isl1 in the epigenetic control of cardiomyocyte cell fate","Generation of widely differing and specialized cell types from a single totipotent zygote involves large-scale transcriptional changes and chromatin reorganization. Pioneer transcription factors play key roles in programming the epigenome and facilitating recruitment of additional regulatory factors during successive cell lineage specification and differentiation steps. Here we show that Isl1 acts as a pioneer factor driving cardiomyocyte lineage commitment by shaping the chromatin landscape of cardiac progenitor cells. Using an Isl1 hypomorphic mouse line which shows congenital heart defects, genome-wide profiling of Isl1 binding together with RNA- and ATAC-sequencing of cardiac progenitor cells and their derivatives, we uncover a regulatory network downstream of Isl1 that orchestrates cardiogenesis. Mechanistically, we show that Isl1 binds to compacted chromatin and works in concert with the Brg1-Baf60c-based SWI/SNF complex to promote permissive cardiac lineage-specific alterations in the chromatin landscape not only of genes with critical functions in cardiac progenitor cells, but also of cardiomyocyte structural genes that are highly expressed when Isl1 itself is no longer present. Thus, the Isl1/Brg1-Baf60c complex plays a crucial role in orchestrating proper cardiogenesis and in establishing epigenetic memory of cardiomyocyte fate commitment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0168-1"
"cr","Cortical branched actin determines cell cycle progression","The actin cytoskeleton generates and senses forces. Here we report that branched actin networks from the cell cortex depend on ARPC1B-containing Arp2/3 complexes and that they are specifically monitored by type I coronins to control cell cycle progression in mammary epithelial cells. Cortical ARPC1B-dependent branched actin networks are regulated by the RAC1/WAVE/ARPIN pathway and drive lamellipodial protrusions. Accordingly, we uncover that the duration of the G1 phase scales with migration persistence in single migrating cells. Moreover, cortical branched actin more generally determines S-phase entry by integrating soluble stimuli such as growth factors and mechanotransduction signals, ensuing from substratum rigidity or stretching of epithelial monolayers. Many tumour cells lose this dependence for cortical branched actin. But the RAC1-transformed tumour cells stop cycling upon Arp2/3 inhibition. Among all genes encoding Arp2/3 subunits, ARPC1B overexpression in tumours is associated with the poorest metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients. Arp2/3 specificity may thus provide diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities in cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0160-9"

Here, we critically review the current state of the art regarding non-apoptotic types of RCD, including necroptosis, pyroptosis, ferroptosis, entotic cell death, netotic cell death, parthanatos, lysosome-dependent cell death, autophagy-dependent cell death, alkaliptosis and oxeiptosis.

They accomplish this task through the coordinated cleavage of invading substrates of single-stranded RNA and DNA (ssDNA and ssRNA) by the Csm (type III-A) or Cmr (type III-B) effector complexes. The ssRNA is complementarily bound to the CRISPR RNA (crRNA). However, the structural basis for the DNase and RNase activation of the Csm nucleoprotein complex is largely unknown. Here we report cryo-EM structures of the Csm-crRNA complex, with or without target ssRNA, at near-atomic resolution. Our cryo-EM maps allow us to build atomic models of the key macromolecular components, including Cas10, Csm2, Csm3, Csm4, crRNA and the invading ssRNA. Our structure resolves unambiguously the stoichiometry and tertiary structures of the Csm protein complex and the interactions between protein components and the crRNA/ssRNA. Interestingly, the new atomic structures of the Csm proteins presented here are similar to those of previously known Csm proteins in other species despite their low sequence similarity. Our combined structural and biochemical data suggest that ssRNA cleavage is preferentially carried out near its 5’-end, that the extent of interactions among the ssRNA, crRNA and the protein components regulates the DNase activity of the Csm complex, and that the 3’ flanking sequence of ssRNA activates the Cas10 DNase activity allosterically.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0151-x"

Plants have evolved sophisticated epigenetic machinery to respond quickly to heat, and exhibit transgenerational memory of the heat-induced release of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). However, how thermomemory is transmitted to progeny and the physiological relevance are elusive. Here we show that heat-induced HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A2 (HSFA2) directly activates the H3K27me3 demethylase RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6), which in turn derepresses HSFA2. REF6 and HSFA2 establish a heritable feedback loop, and activate an E3 ubiquitin ligase, SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3)-INTERACTING PROTEIN 1 (SGIP1). SGIP1-mediated SGS3 degradation leads to inhibited biosynthesis of trans-acting siRNA (tasiRNA). The REF6-HSFA2 loop and reduced tasiRNA converge to release HEAT-INDUCED TAS1 TARGET 5 (HTT5), which drives early flowering but attenuates immunity. Thus, heat induces transmitted phenotypes via a coordinated epigenetic network involving histone demethylases, transcription factors, and tasiRNAs, ensuring reproductive success and transgenerational stress adaptation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-019-0145-8"

However, the structural mechanisms underlying these strategies remain undefined. Here, we present crystal structure of a SpCas9 variant, xCas9 3.7 that has broad PAM compatibility and high DNA targeting specificity, in complex with a single-guide RNA and its double-stranded DNA targets. Structural comparison revealed that salt bridge-stabilized R1335 is critical for the stringent selection of PAM sequence by SpCas9. Unrestricted rotamerization of this residue by the E1219V mutation in xCas9 3.7 lessens the stringency for PAM recognition and allows SpCas9 to recognize multiple PAM sequences as further supported by biochemical data. Compared to those in wild-type (WT) SpCas9, REC2 and REC3 domains in xCas9 3.7 undergo striking conformational changes, leading to reduced contact with DNA substrate. SpCas9 mutants engineered to display less interaction with DNA and have conformationally more flexible REC2 and REC3 domains display enhanced specificity for DNA substrates in both biochemical and cellular assays. Taken together, our findings reveal the structural mechanisms underlying the broadened PAM compatibility and high DNA fidelity of xCas9 3.7, which can assist rational engineering of more efficient SpCas9 variants and probably other Cas9 orthologs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0131-6"
"cr","A programmed wave of uridylation-primed mRNA degradation is essential for meiotic progression and mammalian spermatogenesis","Several developmental stages of spermatogenesis are transcriptionally quiescent which presents major challenges associated with the regulation of gene expression. Here we identify that the zygotene to pachytene transition is not only associated with the resumption of transcription but also a wave of programmed mRNA degradation that is essential for meiotic progression. We explored whether terminal uridydyl transferase 4- (TUT4-) or TUT7-mediated 3′ mRNA uridylation contributes to this wave of mRNA degradation during pachynema. Indeed, both TUT4 and TUT7 are expressed throughout most of spermatogenesis, however, loss of either TUT4 or TUT7 does not have any major impact upon spermatogenesis. Combined TUT4 and TUT7 (TUT4/7) deficiency results in embryonic growth defects, while conditional gene targeting revealed an essential role for TUT4/7 in pachytene progression. Loss of TUT4/7 results in the reduction of miRNA, piRNA and mRNA 3′ uridylation. Although this reduction does not greatly alter miRNA or piRNA expression, TUT4/7-mediated uridylation is required for the clearance of many zygotene-expressed transcripts in pachytene cells. We find that TUT4/7-regulated transcripts in pachytene spermatocytes are characterized by having long 3′ UTRs with length-adjusted enrichment for AU-rich elements. We also observed these features in TUT4/7-regulated maternal transcripts whose dosage was recently shown to be essential for sculpting a functional maternal transcriptome and meiosis. Therefore, mRNA 3′ uridylation is a critical determinant of both male and female germline transcriptomes. In conclusion, we have identified a novel requirement for 3′ uridylation-programmed zygotene mRNA clearance in pachytene spermatocytes that is essential for male meiotic progression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0128-1"

The states and modifications of chromatin represent critical sources of information for this process. However, the dynamics and interrelations of these chromatin characteristics remain elusive. In this study, we developed an improved scCOOL-seq technique (iscCOOL-seq), which is a multi-omics, single-cell and single-base resolution method with high mapping rates, and explored the chromatin accessibility landscape and its relationship to DNA methylation in growing mouse oocytes. The most dramatic change in chromatin accessibility occurs during oocyte growth initiation, accompanied with prominent transcriptome alterations and an elevated variation in DNA methylation levels among individual oocytes. Unlike CpG islands (CGIs), partially methylated domains (PMDs) are associated with a low density of nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) during the whole maturation period. Surprisingly, highly expressed genes are usually associated with NDRs at their transcriptional end sites (TESs). In addition, genes with de novo methylated gene bodies during oocyte maturation are already open at their promoters before oocyte growth initiation. Furthermore, epigenetic and transcription factors that might be involved in oocyte maturation are identified. Our work paves the way for dissecting the complex, yet highly coordinated, epigenetic alterations during mouse oocyte growth and the establishment of totipotency.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0125-4"

Here, we identify a novel m6A reader, Prrc2a (Proline rich coiled-coil 2 A), which controls oligodendrocyte specification and myelination. Nestin-Cre-mediated knockout of Prrc2a induces significant hypomyelination, decreased lifespan, as well as locomotive and cognitive defects in a mouse model. Further analyses reveal that Prrc2a is involved in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) proliferation and oligodendrocyte fate determination. Accordingly, oligodendroglial-lineage specific deletion of Prrc2a causes a similar phenotype of Nestin-Cre-mediated deletion. Combining transcriptome-wide RNA-seq, m6A-RIP-seq and Prrc2a RIP-seq analysis, we find that Olig2 is a critical downstream target gene of Prrc2a in oligodendrocyte development. Furthermore, Prrc2a stabilizes Olig2 mRNA through binding to a consensus GGACU motif in the Olig2 CDS (coding sequence) in an m6A-dependent manner. Interestingly, we also find that the m6A demethylase, Fto, erases the m6A modification of Olig2 mRNA and promotes its degradation. Together, our results indicate that Prrc2a plays an important role in oligodendrocyte specification through functioning as a novel m6A reader. These findings suggest a new avenue for the development of therapeutic strategies for hypomyelination-related neurological diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0113-8"
"cr","Ubiquitination of Rheb governs growth factor-induced mTORC1 activation","Mechanistic target of rapamycin mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) plays a key role in the integration of various environmental signals to regulate cell growth and metabolism. mTORC1 is recruited to the lysosome where it is activated by its interaction with GTP-bound Rheb GTPase. However, the regulatory mechanism of Rheb activity remains largely unknown. Here, we show that ubiquitination governs the nucleotide-bound status of Rheb. Lysosome-anchored E3 ligase RNF152 catalyzes Rheb ubiquitination and promotes its binding to the TSC complex. EGF enhances the deubiquitination of Rheb through AKT-dependent USP4 phosphorylation, leading to the release of Rheb from the TSC complex. Functionally, ubiquitination of Rheb is linked to mTORC1-mediated signaling and  consequently regulates tumor growth. Thus, we propose a mechanistic model whereby Rheb–mediated mTORC1 activation is dictated by a dynamic opposing act between Rheb ubiquitination and deubiquitination that are catalyzed by RNF152 and USP4 respectively.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0120-9"

The paradigm of InsP3R activation is the coupled interplay between binding of InsP3 and Ca2+ that switches the ion conduction pathway between closed and open states to enable the passage of Ca2+ through the channel. However, the molecular mechanism of how the receptor senses and decodes ligand-binding signals into gating motion remains unknown. Here, we present the electron cryo-microscopy structure of InsP3R1 from rat cerebellum determined to 4.1 Å resolution in the presence of activating concentrations of Ca2+ and adenophostin A (AdA), a structural mimetic of InsP3 and the most potent known agonist of the channel. Comparison with the 3.9 Å-resolution structure of InsP3R1 in the Apo-state, also reported herein, reveals the binding arrangement of AdA in the tetrameric channel assembly and striking ligand-induced conformational rearrangements within cytoplasmic domains coupled to the dilation of a hydrophobic constriction at the gate. Together, our results provide critical insights into the mechanistic principles by which ligand-binding allosterically gates InsP3R channel.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0108-5"

However, in Arabidopsis, Like Heterochromatin Protein 1 (LHP1) recognizes and colocalizes genome-wide with H3K27me3, and is the functional homolog of Polycomb protein. This raises the question whether genuine HP1 homologs exist in plants. Here, we report on the discovery of ADCP1, a plant-specific triple tandem Agenet protein, as a multivalent H3K9me reader in Arabidopsis, and establish that ADCP1 is essential for heterochromatin formation and transposon silencing through modulating H3K9 and DNA methylation levels. Structural studies revealed the molecular basis underlying H3K9me-specific recognition by tandem Agenet of ADCP1. Similar to human HP1α and fly HP1a, ADCP1 mediates heterochromatin phase separation. Our results demonstrate that despite its distinct domain compositions, ADCP1 convergently evolves as an HP1-equivalent protein in plants to regulate heterochromatin formation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0104-9"
"cr","Expansion and differentiation of human hepatocyte-derived liver progenitor-like cells and their use for the study of hepatotropic pathogens","The study of pathophysiological mechanisms in human liver disease has been constrained by the inability to expand primary hepatocytes in vitro while maintaining proliferative capacity and metabolic function. We and others have previously shown that mouse mature hepatocytes can be converted to liver progenitor-like cells in vitro with defined chemical factors. Here we describe a protocol achieving efficient conversion of human primary hepatocytes into liver progenitor-like cells (HepLPCs) through delivery of developmentally relevant cues, including NAD + -dependent deacetylase SIRT1 signaling. These HepLPCs could be expanded significantly during in vitro passage. The expanded cells can readily be converted back into metabolically functional hepatocytes in vitro and upon transplantation in vivo. Under three-dimensional culture conditions, differentiated cells generated from HepLPCs regained the ability to support infection or reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Our work demonstrates the utility of the conversion between hepatocyte and liver progenitor-like cells for studying HBV biology and antiviral therapies. These findings will facilitate the study of liver diseases and regenerative medicine.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0103-x"

Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of ~6500 testicular cells from young adults. We found five niche/somatic cell types (Leydig, myoid, Sertoli, endothelial, macrophage), and observed germline-niche interactions and key human-mouse differences. Spermatogenesis, including meiosis, was reconstructed computationally, revealing sequential coding, non-coding, and repeat-element transcriptional signatures. Interestingly, we identified five discrete transcriptional/developmental spermatogonial states, including a novel early SSC state, termed State 0. Epigenetic features and nascent transcription analyses suggested developmental plasticity within spermatogonial States. To understand the origin of State 0, we profiled testicular cells from infants, and identified distinct similarities between adult State 0 and infant SSCs. Overall, our datasets describe key transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of the normal adult human testis, and provide new insights into germ cell developmental transitions and plasticity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0099-2"

The pre-B-to-B and B-to-Bact transitions are driven by the ATPase/helicases Prp28 and Brr2, respectively. In this study, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human pre-B complex and the human B complex at an average resolution of 5.7 and 3.8 Å, respectively. In the pre-B complex, U1 and U2 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) associate with two edges of the tetrahedron-shaped U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP. The pre-mRNA is yet to be recognized by U5 or U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and loop I of U5 snRNA remains unengaged. In the B complex, U1 snRNP and Prp28 are dissociated, the 5’-exon is anchored to loop I of U5 snRNA, and the 5′-splice site is recognized by U6 snRNA through duplex formation. In sharp contrast to S. cerevisiae, most components of U2 snRNP and tri-snRNP, exemplified by Brr2, undergo pronounced rearrangements in the human pre-B-to-B transition.

"cr","Pyruvate kinase M2 regulates homologous recombination-mediated DNA double-strand break repair","Resistance to genotoxic therapies is a primary cause of treatment failure and tumor recurrence. The underlying mechanisms that activate the DNA damage response (DDR) and allow cancer cells to escape the lethal effects of genotoxic therapies remain unclear. Here, we uncover an unexpected mechanism through which pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), the highly expressed PK isoform in cancer cells and a master regulator of cancer metabolic reprogramming, integrates with the DDR to directly promote DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. In response to ionizing radiation and oxidative stress, ATM phosphorylates PKM2 at T328 resulting in its nuclear accumulation. pT328-PKM2 is required and sufficient to promote homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA DSB repair through phosphorylation of CtBP-interacting protein (CtIP) on T126 to increase CtIP’s recruitment at DSBs and resection of DNA ends. Disruption of the ATM-PKM2-CtIP axis sensitizes cancer cells to a variety of DNA-damaging agents and PARP1 inhibition. Furthermore, increased nuclear pT328-PKM2 level is associated with significantly worse survival in glioblastoma patients. Combined, these data advocate the use of PKM2-targeting strategies as a means to not only disrupt cancer metabolism but also inhibit an important mechanism of resistance to genotoxic therapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0086-7"
"cr","A dynamic N6-methyladenosine methylome regulates intrinsic and acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) on mRNAs is critical for various biological processes, yet whether m6A regulates drug resistance remains unknown. Here we show that developing resistant phenotypes during tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy depends on m6A reduction resulting from FTO overexpression in leukemia cells. This deregulated FTO-m6A axis pre-exists in naïve cell populations that are genetically homogeneous and is inducible/reversible in response to TKI treatment. Cells with mRNA m6A hypomethylation and FTO upregulation demonstrate more TKI tolerance and higher growth rates in mice. Either genetic or pharmacological restoration of m6A methylation through FTO deactivation renders resistant cells sensitive to TKIs. Mechanistically, the FTO-dependent m6A demethylation enhances mRNA stability of proliferation/survival transcripts bearing m6A and subsequently leads to increased protein synthesis. Our findings identify a novel function for the m6A methylation in regulating cell fate decision and demonstrate that dynamic m6A methylome is an additional epigenetic driver of reversible TKI-tolerance state, providing a mechanistic paradigm for drug resistance in cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0097-4"
"cr","METTL3-mediated N6-methyladenosine mRNA modification enhances long-term memory consolidation","The formation of long-term memory is critical for learning ability and social behaviors of humans and animals, yet its underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We found that the efficacy of hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation is regulated by METTL3, an RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methyltransferase, through promoting the translation of neuronal early-response genes. Such effect is exquisitely dependent on the m6A methyltransferase function of METTL3. Depleting METTL3 in mouse hippocampus reduces memory consolidation ability, yet unimpaired learning outcomes can be achieved if adequate training was given or the m6A methyltransferase function of METTL3 was restored. The abundance of METTL3 in wild-type mouse hippocampus is positively correlated with learning efficacy, and overexpression of METTL3 significantly enhances long-term memory consolidation. These findings uncover a direct role of RNA m6A modification in regulating long-term memory formation, and also indicate that memory efficacy difference among individuals could be compensated by repeated learning.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0092-9"
"cr","Tom20 senses iron-activated ROS signaling to promote melanoma cell pyroptosis","Iron has been shown to trigger oxidative stress by elevating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to participate in different modes of cell death, such as ferroptosis, apoptosis and necroptosis. However, whether iron-elevated ROS is also linked to pyroptosis has not been reported. Here, we demonstrate that iron-activated ROS can induce pyroptosis via a Tom20-Bax-caspase-GSDME pathway. In melanoma cells, iron enhanced ROS signaling initiated by CCCP, causing the oxidation and oligomerization of the mitochondrial outer membrane protein Tom20. Bax is recruited to mitochondria by oxidized Tom20, which facilitates cytochrome c release to cytosol to activate caspase-3, eventually triggering pyroptotic death by inducing GSDME cleavage. Therefore, ROS acts as a causative factor and Tom20 senses ROS signaling for iron-driven pyroptotic death of melanoma cells. Since iron activates ROS for GSDME-dependent pyroptosis induction and melanoma cells specifically express a high level of GSDME, iron may be a potential candidate for melanoma therapy. Based on the functional mechanism of iron shown above, we further demonstrate that iron supplementation at a dosage used in iron-deficient patients is sufficient to maximize the anti-tumor effect of clinical ROS-inducing drugs to inhibit xenograft tumor growth and metastasis of melanoma cells through GSDME-dependent pyroptosis. Moreover, no obvious side effects are observed in the normal tissues and organs of mice during the combined treatment of clinical drugs and iron. This study not only identifies iron as a sensitizer amplifying ROS signaling to drive pyroptosis, but also implicates a novel iron-based intervention strategy for melanoma therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0090-y"
"cr","Small molecule inhibitors reveal allosteric regulation of USP14 via steric blockade","The ubiquitin system is important for drug discovery, and the discovery of selective small-molecule inhibitors of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) remains an active yet extremely challenging task. With a few exceptions, previously developed inhibitors have been found to bind the evolutionarily conserved catalytic centers of DUBs, resulting in poor selectivity. The small molecule IU1 was the first-ever specific inhibitor identified and exhibited surprisingly excellent selectivity for USP14 over other DUBs. However, the molecular mechanism for this selectivity was elusive. Herein, we report the high-resolution co-crystal structures of the catalytic domain of USP14 bound to IU1 and three IU1 derivatives. All the structures of these complexes indicate that IU1 and its analogs bind to a previously unknown steric binding site in USP14, thus blocking the access of the C-terminus of ubiquitin to the active site of USP14 and abrogating USP14 activity. Importantly, this steric site in USP14 is very unique, as suggested by structural alignments of USP14 with several known DUB X-ray structures. These results, in conjunction with biochemical characterization, indicate a coherent steric blockade mechanism for USP14 inhibition by compounds of the IU series. In light of the recent report of steric blockade of USP7 by FT671, this work suggests a potential generally applicable allosteric mechanism for the regulation of DUBs via steric blockade, as showcased by our discovery of IU1-248 which is 10-fold more potent than IU1.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0091-x"
"cr","A post-ingestive amino acid sensor promotes food consumption in Drosophila","Adequate protein intake is crucial for the survival and well-being of animals. How animals assess prospective protein sources and ensure dietary amino acid intake plays a critical role in protein homeostasis. By using a quantitative feeding assay, we show that three amino acids, L-glutamate (L-Glu), L-alanine (L-Ala) and L-aspartate (L-Asp), but not their D-enantiomers or the other 17 natural L-amino acids combined, rapidly promote food consumption in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. This feeding-promoting effect of dietary amino acids is independent of mating experience and internal nutritional status. In vivo and ex vivo calcium imagings show that six brain neurons expressing diuretic hormone 44 (DH44) can be rapidly and directly activated by these amino acids, suggesting that these neurons are an amino acid sensor. Genetic inactivation of DH44+ neurons abolishes the increase in food consumption induced by dietary amino acids, whereas genetic activation of these neurons is sufficient to promote feeding, suggesting that DH44+ neurons mediate the effect of dietary amino acids to promote food consumption. Single-cell transcriptome analysis and immunostaining reveal that a putative amino acid transporter, CG13248, is enriched in DH44+ neurons. Knocking down CG13248 expression in DH44+ neurons blocks the increase in food consumption and eliminates calcium responses induced by dietary amino acids. Therefore, these data identify DH44+ neuron as a key sensor to detect amino acids and to enhance food intake via a putative transporter CG13248. These results shed critical light on the regulation of protein homeostasis at organismal levels by the nervous system.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0084-9"
"cr","The RNA-binding protein ROD1/PTBP3 cotranscriptionally defines AID-loading sites to mediate antibody class switch in mammalian genomes","Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) mediates class switching by binding to a small fraction of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to diversify the antibody repertoire. The precise mechanism for highly selective AID targeting in the genome has remained elusive. Here, we report an RNA-binding protein, ROD1 (also known as PTBP3), that is both required and sufficient to define AID-binding sites genome-wide in activated B cells. ROD1 interacts with AID via an ultraconserved loop, which proves to be critical for the recruitment of AID to ssDNA using bi-directionally transcribed nascent RNAs as stepping stones. Strikingly, AID-specific mutations identified in human patients with hyper-IgM syndrome type 2 (HIGM2) completely disrupt the AID interacting surface with ROD1, thereby abolishing the recruitment of AID to immunoglobulin (Ig) loci. Together, our results suggest that bi-directionally transcribed RNA traps the RNA-binding protein ROD1, which serves as a guiding system for AID to load onto specific genomic loci to induce DNA rearrangement during immune responses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0076-9"
"cr","STAT3 associates with vacuolar H+-ATPase and regulates cytosolic and lysosomal pH","Dysregulated intracellular pH is emerging as a hallmark of cancer. In spite of their acidic environment and increased acid production, cancer cells maintain alkaline intracellular pH that promotes cancer progression by inhibiting apoptosis and increasing glycolysis, cell growth, migration, and invasion. Here we identify signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) as a key factor in the preservation of alkaline cytosol. STAT3 associates with the vacuolar H+-ATPase in a coiled-coil domain-dependent manner and increases its activity in living cells and in vitro. Accordingly, STAT3 depletion disrupts intracellular proton equilibrium by decreasing cytosolic pH and increasing lysosomal pH, respectively. This dysregulation can be reverted by reconstitution with wild-type STAT3 or STAT3 mutants unable to activate target genes (Tyr705Phe and DNA-binding mutant) or to regulate mitochondrial respiration (Ser727Ala). Upon cytosolic acidification, STAT3 is transcriptionally inactivated and further recruited to lysosomal membranes to reestablish intracellular proton equilibrium. These data reveal STAT3 as a regulator of intracellular pH and, vice versa, intracellular pH as a regulator of STAT3 localization and activity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0080-0"

However, how the human trophoblast lineage is regulated, including the categorization of the placental cell subtypes is poorly understood. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on sorted placental cells from first- and second-trimester human placentas. New subtypes of cells of the known cytotrophoblast cells (CTBs), extravillous trophoblast cells (EVTs), Hofbauer cells, and mesenchymal stromal cells were identified and cell-type-specific gene signatures were defined. Functionally, this study revealed many previously unknown functions of the human placenta. Notably, 102 polypeptide hormone genes were found to be expressed by various subtypes of placental cells, which suggests a complex and significant role of these hormones in regulating fetal growth and adaptations of maternal physiology to pregnancy. These results document human placental trophoblast differentiation at single-cell resolution and thus advance our understanding of human placentation during the early stage of pregnancy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0066-y"

Here we obtained the 3.3 Å resolution structure of complex-IV derived from the human supercomplex I1III2IV1 and assigned the NDUFA4 subunit into complex-IV. Intriguingly, NDUFA4 lies exactly at the dimeric interface observed in previously reported crystal structures of complex-IV homodimer which would preclude complex-IV dimerization.

"cr","DNA damage triggers tubular endoplasmic reticulum extension to promote apoptosis by facilitating ER-mitochondria signaling","The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is composed of the nuclear envelope, perinuclear sheets and a peripheral tubular network. The peripheral ER and mitochondria form tight contacts at specific subdomains, which coordinate the functions of the two organelles and are required for multiple cellular processes such as Ca2+ transfer and apoptosis. However, it is largely unknown how ER morphology and ER-mitochondria signaling are dynamically regulated under different physiological or pathological conditions such as DNA damage. Here we show that the peripheral, tubular ER undergoes significant extension in response to DNA damage, and that this process is dependent on p53-mediated transcriptional activation of the ER-shaping proteins REEP1, REEP2 and EI24 (alias PIG8). This promotes the formation of ER-mitochondria contacts through EI24 and the mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC2, facilitates Ca2+ transfer from ER to mitochondria and promotes DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Thus, we identify a unique DNA damage response pathway involving alterations in ER morphology, ER-mitochondria signaling, and apoptosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0065-z"

"cr","PTEN-L is a novel protein phosphatase for ubiquitin dephosphorylation to inhibit PINK1–Parkin-mediated mitophagy","Mitophagy is an important type of selective autophagy for specific elimination of damaged mitochondria. PTEN-induced putative kinase protein 1 (PINK1)-catalyzed phosphorylation of ubiquitin (Ub) plays a critical role in the onset of PINK1–Parkin-mediated mitophagy. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-long (PTEN-L) is a newly identified isoform of PTEN, with addition of 173 amino acids to its N-terminus. Here we report that PTEN-L is a novel negative regulator of mitophagy via its protein phosphatase activity against phosphorylated ubiquitin. We found that PTEN-L localizes at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and overexpression of PTEN-L inhibits, whereas deletion of PTEN-L promotes, mitophagy induced by various mitochondria-damaging agents. Mechanistically, PTEN-L is capable of effectively preventing Parkin mitochondrial translocation, reducing Parkin phosphorylation, maintaining its closed inactive conformation, and inhibiting its E3 ligase activity. More importantly, PTEN-L reduces the level of phosphorylated ubiquitin (pSer65-Ub) in vivo, and in vitro phosphatase assay confirms that PTEN-L dephosphorylates pSer65-Ub via its protein phosphatase activity, independently of its lipid phosphatase function. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a novel function of PTEN-L as a protein phosphatase for ubiquitin, which counteracts PINK1-mediated ubiquitin phosphorylation leading to blockage of the feedforward mechanisms in mitophagy induction and eventual suppression of mitophagy. Thus, understanding this novel function of PTEN-L provides a key missing piece in the molecular puzzle controlling mitophagy, a critical process in many important human diseases including neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0056-0"

Here, we report that linker histone H1.2 is an essential regulator of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation. We show that H1.2 protects chromatin from aberrant ATM activation through direct interaction with the ATM HEAT repeat domain and inhibition of MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex-dependent ATM recruitment. Upon DNA damage, H1.2 undergoes rapid PARP1-dependent chromatin dissociation through poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) of its C terminus and further proteasomal degradation. Inhibition of H1.2 displacement by PARP1 depletion or an H1.2 PARylation-dead mutation compromises ATM activation and DNA damage repair, thus leading to impaired cell survival. Taken together, our findings suggest that linker histone H1.2 functions as a physiological barrier for ATM to target the chromatin, and PARylation-mediated active H1.2 turnover is required for robust ATM activation and DNA damage repair.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0048-0"
"cr","Tissue clearing of both hard and soft tissue organs with the PEGASOS method","Tissue clearing technique enables visualization of opaque organs and tissues in 3-dimensions (3-D) by turning tissue transparent. Current tissue clearing methods are restricted by limited types of tissues that can be cleared with each individual protocol, which inevitably led to the presence of blind-spots within whole body or body parts imaging. Hard tissues including bones and teeth are still the most difficult organs to be cleared. In addition, loss of endogenous fluorescence remains a major concern for solvent-based clearing methods. Here, we developed a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-associated solvent system (PEGASOS), which rendered nearly all types of tissues transparent and preserved endogenous fluorescence. Bones and teeth could be turned nearly invisible after clearing. The PEGASOS method turned the whole adult mouse body transparent and we were able to image an adult mouse head composed of bones, teeth, brain, muscles, and other tissues with no blind areas. Hard tissue transparency enabled us to reconstruct intact mandible, teeth, femur, or knee joint in 3-D. In addition, we managed to image intact mouse brain at sub-cellular resolution and to trace individual neurons and axons over a long distance. We also visualized dorsal root ganglions directly through vertebrae. Finally, we revealed the distribution pattern of neural network in 3-D within the marrow space of long bone. These results suggest that the PEGASOS method is a useful tool for general biomedical research.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0049-z"
"cr","The BH3-only protein BAD mediates TNFα cytotoxicity despite concurrent activation of IKK and NF-κB in septic shock","The inflammatory cytokine TNFα plays a crucial role in the pathology of many inflammatory and infectious diseases. However, the mechanism underlying TNFα cytotoxicity in these diseases is incompletely understood. Here we report that the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member BAD mediates TNFα cytotoxicity despite concurrent activation of IKK and NF-κB in vitro by inducing apoptosis in cultured cells and in vivo by eliciting tissue damage of multiple organs and contributing to mortality in septic shock. At high doses, TNFα significantly inactivates RhoA through activation of the Src-p190GAP pathway, resulting in massive actin stress fiber destabilization, followed by substantial BAD release from the cytoskeleton to the cytosol. Under this condition, activated IKK fails to phosphorylate all cytosolic BAD, allowing translocation of non-phosphorylated BAD to mitochondria to trigger apoptosis. Polymicrobial infection utilizes the same mechanism as high-dose TNFα to elicit apoptosis-associated tissue damage of multiple organs. Consequently, loss of Bad or elimination of BAD pro-apoptotic activity protects mice from tissue damage of multiple organs and reduces mortality rates. Our results support a model in which BAD mediates TNFα cytotoxicity despite concurrent activation of the IKK-NF-κB pathway in cultured mammalian cells and in septic shock.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0041-7"
"cr","MAP3K1 and MAP2K4 mutations are associated with sensitivity to MEK inhibitors in multiple cancer models","Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is frequent in cancer. Drug development efforts have been focused on kinases in this pathway, most notably on RAF and MEK. We show here that MEK inhibition activates JNK-JUN signaling through suppression of DUSP4, leading to activation of HER Receptor Tyrosine Kinases. This stimulates the MAPK pathway in the presence of drug, thereby blunting the effect of MEK inhibition. Cancers that have lost MAP3K1 or MAP2K4 fail to activate JNK-JUN. Consequently, loss-of-function mutations in either MAP3K1 or MAP2K4 confer sensitivity to MEK inhibition by disabling JNK-JUN-mediated feedback loop upon MEK inhibition. In a panel of 168 Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) tumors, MAP3K1 and MAP2K4 mutation status is a strong predictor of response to MEK inhibition. Our findings suggest that cancers having mutations in MAP3K1 or MAP2K4, which are frequent in tumors of breast, prostate and colon, may respond to MEK inhibitors. Our findings also suggest that MAP3K1 and MAP2K4 are potential drug targets in combination with MEK inhibitors, in spite of the fact that they are encoded by tumor suppressor genes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0044-4"

The m6A modification is deposited by the m6A methyltransferase complex (MTC; i.e., writer) composed of METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP, and probably also VIRMA and RBM15, and can be removed by m6A demethylases (i.e., erasers) such as FTO and ALKBH5. The fates of m6A-modified mRNAs rely on the functions of distinct proteins that recognize them (i.e., readers), which may affect the stability, splicing, and/or translation of target mRNAs. Given the functional importance of the m6A modification machinery in normal bioprocesses, it is not surprising that evidence is emerging that dysregulation of m6A modification and the associated proteins also contributes to the initiation, progression, and drug response of cancers. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the study of biological functions and the underlying molecular mechanisms of dysregulated m6A modification and the associated machinery in the pathogenesis and drug response of various types of cancers. In addition, we also discuss possible therapeutic interventions against the dysregulated m6A machinery to treat cancers.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0034-6"

"cr","Ligand-triggered de-repression of Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins coupled to immune receptor kinases","Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins regulate diverse processes by coupling to single-transmembrane receptors. One such receptor is the FLS2 receptor kinase, which perceives bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate immunity through a class of cytoplasmic kinases called BIK1/PBLs. Unlike animal and fungal heterotrimeric G proteins that are activated by a ligand-induced guanine nucleotide exchange activity of seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), plant heterotrimeric G proteins are self-activating. How plant receptors regulate heterotrimeric G proteins in response to external ligands remains unknown. Here we show that RGS1, a GTPase accelerating protein, maintains Arabidopsis G proteins in an inactive state in complex with FLS2. Activation of FLS2 by flg22 induces a BIK1/PBL-mediated phosphorylation of RGS1 at Ser428 and Ser431 and that promotes RGS1 dissociation from the FLS2-G protein complex. This relieves G proteins from the RGS1-mediated repression and enables positive regulation of immune signaling. We additionally show that RGS1 is similarly regulated by multiple immune receptors. Our results uncover ligand-induced de-repression as a mechanism for G protein signaling in plants that is distinct from previously reported mechanism underlying the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins in other systems.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0027-5"
"cr","Malate transported from chloroplast to mitochondrion triggers production of ROS and PCD in Arabidopsis thaliana","Programmed cell death (PCD) is a fundamental biological process. Deficiency in MOSAIC DEATH 1 (MOD1), a plastid-localized enoyl-ACP reductase, leads to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and PCD, which can be suppressed by mitochondrial complex I mutations, indicating a signal from chloroplasts to mitochondria. However, this signal remains to be elucidated. In this study, through cloning and analyzing a series of mod1 suppressors, we reveal a comprehensive organelle communication pathway that regulates the generation of mitochondrial ROS and triggers PCD. We show that mutations in PLASTIDIAL NAD-DEPENDENT MALATE DEHYDROGENASE (plNAD-MDH), chloroplastic DICARBOXYLATE TRANSPORTER 1 (DiT1) and MITOCHONDRIAL MALATE DEHYDROGENASE 1 (mMDH1) can each rescue the ROS accumulation and PCD phenotypes in mod1, demonstrating a direct communication from chloroplasts to mitochondria via the malate shuttle. Further studies demonstrate that these elements play critical roles in the redox homeostasis and plant growth under different photoperiod conditions. Moreover, we reveal that the ROS level and PCD are significantly increased in malate-treated HeLa cells, which can be dramatically attenuated by knockdown of the human gene MDH2, an ortholog of Arabidopsis mMDH1. These results uncover a conserved malate-induced PCD pathway in plant and animal systems, revolutionizing our understanding of the communication between organelles.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0024-8"

Glutaminase C (GAC), the first enzyme in glutaminolysis, has emerged as an important target for cancer therapy and many studies have focused on the mechanism of enhanced GAC expression in cancer cells. However, little is known about the post-translational modification of GAC. Here, we report that phosphorylation is a crucial post-translational modification of GAC, which is responsible for the higher glutaminase activity in lung tumor tissues and cancer cells. We identify the key Ser314 phosphorylation site on GAC that is regulated by the NF-κB-PKCε axis. Blocking Ser314 phosphorylation by the S314A mutation in lung cancer cells inhibits the glutaminase activity, triggers genetic reprogramming, and alleviates tumor malignancy. Furthermore, we find that a high level of GAC phosphorylation correlates with poor survival rate of lung cancer patients. These findings highlight a previously unappreciated mechanism for activation of GAC by phosphorylation and demonstrate that targeting glutaminase activity can inhibit oncogenic transformation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0021-y"
"cr","Polyubiquitin chain-induced p62 phase separation drives autophagic cargo segregation","Misfolded proteins can be degraded by selective autophagy. The prevailing view is that ubiquitin-tagged misfolded proteins are assembled into aggregates by the scaffold protein p62, and the aggregates are then engulfed and degraded by autophagosomes. Here we report that p62 forms droplets in vivo which have liquid-like properties such as high sphericity, the ability to undergo fusion, and recovery after photobleaching. Recombinant p62 does not undergo phase separation in vitro; however, adding a K63 polyubiquitin chain to p62 induces p62 phase separation, which results in enrichment of high-molecular weight ubiquitin signals in p62 droplets. Mixing recombinant p62 with cytosol from p62−/− cells also results in p62 phase separation in a polyubiquitination-dependent manner. Mechanistically, p62 phase separation is dependent on p62 polymerization, the interaction between p62 and ubiquitin, and the valence of the polyubiquitin chain. Moreover, p62 phase separation can be regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. Finally, we demonstrate that disease-associated mutations in p62 can affect phase separation. We propose that polyubiquitin chain-induced p62 phase separation drives autophagic cargo concentration and segregation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0017-7"
"cr","Anti-mitotic chemotherapeutics promote apoptosis through TL1A-activated death receptor 3 in cancer cells","The commonly used antimitotic chemotherapeutic agents such as taxol and vinblastine arrest cell cycle progression by disrupting mitotic spindles, and cause cancer cells to undergo apoptosis through ‘mitotic catastrophe’. The molecular mechanisms by which these drugs induce apoptosis and their relevance to clinical efficacy are not known. Facilitated by a new spindle poison diazonamide, we found that apoptosis induced by these agents requires death receptor 3 (DR3). Mitotic arrest by these agents induces lysosome-dependent secretion of the DR3 ligand, TL1A. Engagement of TL1A with DR3 stimulates the formation of FADD-containing and caspase-8-containing death-inducing signaling complex (DISC), which subsequently activates apoptosis in cells that express DR3. Expression of DR3 and TL1A correlates with the apoptotic response of human tumor xenograft models and human cancer cell lines to antimitotic drugs, providing further evidence that these drugs kill cancer cells through the DR3/TL1A-mediated pathway. These results suggest that TL1A and DR3 may hold promise to be used as biomarkers for predicting clinical response to antimitotic therapeutics.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0018-6"
"cr","A reappraisal of CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade in cancer immunotherapy","It is assumed that anti-CTLA-4 antibodies cause tumor rejection by blocking negative signaling from B7-CTLA-4 interactions. Surprisingly, at concentrations considerably higher than plasma levels achieved by clinically effective dosing, the anti-CTLA-4 antibody Ipilimumab blocks neither B7 trans-endocytosis by CTLA-4 nor CTLA-4 binding to immobilized or cell-associated B7. Consequently, Ipilimumab does not increase B7 on dendritic cells (DCs) from either CTLA4 gene humanized (Ctla4h/h) or human CD34+ stem cell-reconstituted NSG™ mice. In Ctla4h/m mice expressing both human and mouse CTLA4 genes, anti-CTLA-4 antibodies that bind to human but not mouse CTLA-4 efficiently induce Treg depletion and Fc receptor-dependent tumor rejection. The blocking antibody L3D10 is comparable to the non-blocking Ipilimumab in causing tumor rejection. Remarkably, L3D10 progenies that lose blocking activity during humanization remain fully competent in inducing Treg depletion and tumor rejection. Anti-B7 antibodies that effectively block CD4 T cell activation and de novo CD8 T cell priming in lymphoid organs do not negatively affect the immunotherapeutic effect of Ipilimumab. Thus, clinically effective anti-CTLA-4 mAb causes tumor rejection by mechanisms that are independent of checkpoint blockade but dependent on the host Fc receptor. Our data call for a reappraisal of the CTLA-4 checkpoint blockade hypothesis and provide new insights for the next generation of safe and effective anti-CTLA-4 mAbs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0011-0"
"cr","KRAB-type zinc-finger proteins PITA and PISA specifically regulate p53-dependent glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration","Few p53 regulators participate in selective control of p53-mediated cellular metabolism. How p53-mediated aerobic and glycolytic pathways are negatively regulated remains largely unclear. Here, we identified two KRAB-type zinc-finger proteins, PITA (p53 inhibitor of TIGAR activation) and PISA (p53 inhibitor of SCO2 activation), as selective regulators of p53 in metabolic control. PITA and PISA interact with p53 and specifically suppress transcription of the glycolysis regulator TIGAR and the oxidation phosphorylation regulator SCO2, respectively. Importantly, PITA transgenic mice exhibited increased 6-phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) activity and an elevated glycolytic rate, whereas PISA transgenic mice had decreased cytochrome c oxidase activity and reduced mitochondrial respiration. In response to glucose starvation, PITA dissociates from p53, resulting in activation of p53 and induction of TIGAR, which inhibited aerobic glycolysis. Prolonged starvation leads to PISA dissociation from p53 and induction of SCO2 and p53-promoted mitochondrial respiration. The dynamic regulation of PITA and PISA upon metabolic stress is dependent on ATM kinase-mediated phosphorylation of PITA and PISA. Furthermore, in human colorectal cancers, the elevated expression of PITA and PISA correlates with cancer progression. Depletion of PITA or PISA in colorectal cancer cells reduced the cell proliferation, migration and invasion. These results identify PITA and PISA as selective regulators of p53-mediated glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration and provide novel insights into the role of p53 network in cell metabolic control.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0008-8"

The primary function of tRNA as the adaptor of amino acids and the genetic code in protein synthesis is well known. tRNA modifications play multi-faceted roles in decoding and other cellular processes. The abundance, modification, and aminoacylation (charging) levels of tRNAs contribute to mRNA decoding in ways that reflect the cell type and its environment; however, how these factors work together to maximize translation efficiency remains to be understood. tRNAs also interact with many proteins not involved in translation and this may coordinate translation activity and other processes in the cell.

"cr","Uncoupling therapeutic from immunotherapy-related adverse effects for safer and effective anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in CTLA4 humanized mice","Anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) confer a cancer immunotherapeutic effect (CITE) but cause severe immunotherapy-related adverse events (irAE). Targeting CTLA-4 has shown remarkable long-term benefit and thus remains a valuable tool for cancer immunotherapy if the irAE can be brought under control. An animal model, which recapitulates clinical irAE and CITE, would be valuable for developing safer CTLA-4-targeting reagents. Here, we report such a model using mice harboring the humanized Ctla4 gene. In this model, the clinically used drug, Ipilimumab, induced severe irAE especially when combined with an anti-PD-1 antibody; whereas another mAb, L3D10, induced comparable CITE with very mild irAE under the same conditions. The irAE corresponded to systemic T cell activation and resulted in reduced ratios of regulatory to effector T cells (Treg/Teff) among autoreactive T cells. Using mice that were either homozygous or heterozygous for the human allele, we found that the irAE required bi-allelic engagement, while CITE only required monoallelic engagement. As with the immunological distinction for monoallelic vs bi-allelic engagement, we found that bi-allelic engagement of the Ctla4 gene was necessary for preventing conversion of autoreactive T cells into Treg cells. Humanization of L3D10, which led to loss of blocking activity, further increased safety without affecting the therapeutic effect. Taken together, our data demonstrate that complete CTLA-4 occupation, systemic T cell activation and preferential expansion of self-reactive T cells are dispensable for tumor rejection but correlate with irAE, while blocking B7-CTLA-4 interaction impacts neither safety nor efficacy of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies. These data provide important insights for the clinical development of safer and potentially more effective CTLA-4-targeting immunotherapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-018-0012-z"
"cr","m-AAA proteases, mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and neurodegeneration","The function of mitochondria depends on ubiquitously expressed and evolutionary conserved m-AAA proteases in the inner membrane. These ATP-dependent peptidases form hexameric complexes built up of homologous subunits. AFG3L2 subunits assemble either into homo-oligomeric isoenzymes or with SPG7 (paraplegin) subunits into hetero-oligomeric proteolytic complexes. Mutations in AFG3L2 are associated with dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA28) characterized by the loss of Purkinje cells, whereas mutations in SPG7 cause a recessive form of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP7) with motor neurons of the cortico-spinal tract being predominantly affected. Pleiotropic functions have been assigned to m-AAA proteases, which act as quality control and regulatory enzymes in mitochondria. Loss of m-AAA proteases affects mitochondrial protein synthesis and respiration and leads to mitochondrial fragmentation and deficiencies in the axonal transport of mitochondria. Moreover m-AAA proteases regulate the assembly of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) complex. Impaired degradation of the MCU subunit EMRE in AFG3L2-deficient mitochondria results in the formation of deregulated MCU complexes, increased mitochondrial calcium uptake and increased vulnerability of neurons for calcium-induced cell death. A reduction of calcium influx into the cytosol of Purkinje cells rescues ataxia in an AFG3L2-deficient mouse model. In this review, we discuss the relationship between the m-AAA protease and mitochondrial calcium homeostasis and its relevance for neurodegeneration and describe a novel mouse model lacking MCU specifically in Purkinje cells. Our results pledge for a novel view on m-AAA proteases that integrates their pleiotropic functions in mitochondria to explain the pathogenesis of associated neurodegenerative disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201817"

Multiple mechanisms have evolved to identify and combat mitochondrial dysfunction to maintain the health of the organism. One such pathway is the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), which is regulated by the mitochondrial import efficiency of the transcription factor ATFS-1 in C. elegans and potentially orthologous transcription factors in mammals (ATF4, ATF5, CHOP). Upon mitochondrial dysfunction, import of ATFS-1 into mitochondria is reduced, allowing it to be trafficked to the nucleus where it promotes the expression of genes that promote survival and recovery of the mitochondrial network. Here, we discuss recent findings underlying UPRmt signal transduction and how this adaptive transcriptional response may interact with other mitochondrial stress response pathways.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201816"

However, many patients develop resistance with unclear mechanisms. In a large cohort study of breast cancer patients who underwent surgery followed by tamoxifen treatment, we demonstrate that ERα36, a variant of ERα66, correlates with poor prognosis. Mechanistically, tamoxifen directly binds and activates ERα36 to enhance the stemness and metastasis of breast cancer cells via transcriptional stimulation of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1). Consistently, the tamoxifen-induced stemness and metastasis can be attenuated by either ALDH1 inhibitors or a specific ERα36 antibody. Thus, tamoxifen acts as an agonist on ERα36 in breast cancer cells, which accounts for hormone therapy resistance and metastasis of breast cancer. Our study not only reveals ERα36 as a stratifying marker for endocrine therapy but also provides a promising therapeutic avenue for tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201815"

Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the human Bact complex in three distinct conformational states. The EM map allows atomic modeling of nearly all protein components of the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), including three of the SF3a complex and seven of the SF3b complex. The structure of the human Bact complex contains 52 proteins, U2, U5, and U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and a pre-mRNA. Three distinct conformations have been captured, representing the early, mature, and late states of the human Bact complex. These complexes differ in the orientation of the Switch loop of Prp8, the splicing factors RNF113A and NY-CO-10, and most components of the NineTeen complex (NTC) and the NTC-related complex. Analysis of these three complexes and comparison with the B and C complexes reveal an ordered flux of components in the B-to-Bact and the Bact-to-B* transitions, which ultimately prime the active site for the branching reaction.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201814"

CENP-N is recruited to centromeres during S phase and gradually dissociates during G2 phase. This dynamic assembly of CENP-N onto the centromere is regulated by the change in accessibility to CENP-A's RG loop (Arg80/Gly81) during the compacting-opening transition of centromeric chromatin structure through the cell cycle3,4. CENP-N has an N-terminal domain that binds to RG loop of CENP-A and a C-terminal domain that interacts with CENP-L to form CENP-N/CENP-L complex (CENP-LN), which further associates with CENP-C and CENP-HIKM to orchestrate kinetochore assembly1,3,5,6. Recent studies from hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HXMS) have shown that nucleosomal DNA (−21 and −22 nt) had direct contacts with CENP-N in addition to CENP-A's RG loop7, suggesting a potential role of CENP-N-DNA interaction in CENP-A nucleosome recognition. Although the crystal structures of human CENP-A nucleosome core particle (NCP) and yeast Iml3 (CENP-L ortholog) in complex with the C-terminal domain of Chl4 (CENP-N ortholog) are available, the structure of the N-terminal domain of CENP-N (CENP-NN) and the pattern of interaction between CENP-N and CENP-A NCP remain elusive, significantly limiting our understanding of CENP-N recognition of CENP-A NCP at kinetochores.To elucidate the molecular basis of the specific recognition of CENP-A NCP by the CENP-LN complex, we reconstituted a complex containing CENP-A NCP wrapped with 147 bp DNA and CENP-LN complex, and carried out structural studies by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (Supplementary information, Figures S1A, S1B, S1C, S1E and S2A-S2B). By combining 130 598 particle images from 6 312 electron-counting movies recorded in a TF20 and a Titan Krios cryo-electron microscope, we obtained a cryo-EM structure of CENP-A NCP/CENP-LN complex at an average resolution of 5.8 Å (with the resolution reaching 4.5 Å in some core regions) by single-particle analysis (Supplementary information, Figures S3A, S3B, S3C, S3D, S3E, S3I and S4). Surface views of the cryo-EM structure show structural features characteristic of NCP, including well-resolved major and minor grooves of the dsDNA (Figure 1A), helices and connecting loops of the four histone proteins in CENP-A NCP (Figure 1B). Because the crystal structure of CENP-A NCP8 (PDB ID: 3AN2) contains only 121 bp DNA and that of the NCP with CENP-C peptide9 (PDB ID: 4X23) has the same length of DNA used in our study, we fitted a composite CENP-A NCP atomic model consisting of the H2A/H2B/CENP-A/H4 octamer and 147 bp DNA in the two known crystal structures into our cryo-EM density map and obtained excellent match (Figure 1B). This fitting also shows that the 13 bp DNA at the entrance and exit of CENP-A NCP missing in the CENP-A NCP crystal structure is resolved in our structure and exhibits almost the same arrangement as that of canonical H3 nucleosome (Supplementary information, Figure S5).Figure 1Structural insights into the recognition of CENP-A nucleosomes by CENP-N via CENP-A and nucleosomal DNA.

(non-significant) indicates P > 0.05.Full size imageAttached to one face of the NCP are two extra regions of prominent densities — one proximal to and the other distal from the NCP — that are contributed by the bound CENP-LN complex (Figure 1A and 1C). The NCP-proximal density has extensive contacts with the NCP (Figure 1A), whereas the NCP-distal density has no interaction with NCP and is connected to the NCP-proximal density flexibly with one tenuous/weak density (Figure 1C). The crystal structure of yeast Chl4C/Iml3 (PDB ID: 4JE3) can be placed into the envelope of the NCP-distal density with the N-terminal linker of Chl4C positioned at the tenuous density between the NCP-proximal and -distal regions (Figure 1C, yellow), suggesting that the extra NCP-proximal density (Figure 1C, orange) likely corresponds to CENP-N's N-terminal domain (CENP-NN). Indeed, gel shift assays confirmed that the N-terminal segment (aa 1-214) of CENP-N is sufficient to bind CENP-A nucleosome and free 147 bp DNA (Supplementary information, Figure S6A, S6B, S6C, S6C, S6D). Our cryo-EM map of CENP-NN contains five long (∼20 Å) and 1-3 short (∼13 Å) α-helices surrounding a central β sheet with well-defined densities, especially those at the interface between CENP-N and the NCP (Figure 1A and 1C). These well-resolved secondary structures account for most of the predicted α helices and β strands (∼200 aa, see Supplementary information, Data S1). Docking this crude model of CENP-NN, the composite atomic model of CENP-A NCP and crystal structure of heterodimer of CENP-L with the C-terminal CENP-N (CENP-LNC) into our cryo-EM structure reveals numerous interactions between CENP-N and CENP-A NCP for the first time, allowing us to describe how the N- and C-terminal domains of CENP-N pack together to bridge CENP-A NCP and CENP-L.The interface between CENP-A NCP and CENP-NN covers both the histones (Figure 1D) and the adjacent nucleosomal DNA (Figure 1E). In addition to the previous reports on RG loop of CENP-A, the current cryo-EM structure offers structural insights into its function where the RG loop interacts with at least two different regions of CENP-N, one of which is located at the end of a helix (Figure 1D). Besides the conserved residue R80, D83 also appears to interact with CENP-N according to the structure (Figure 1D). In addition, residues H109-K120 from the C-terminal helix of H2B have been identified as the potential binding region for CENP-N by chemical crosslinking coupled with mass spectrometry (XL-MS)10. Our structure indicates that H2BT119is the most possible residue that is involved in CENP-N binding within this region (Figure 1D).Compared to the RG loop of CENP-A, the contribution of the nucleosomal DNA for the binding of CENP-N has rarely been studied. To our surprise, the contacts between CENP-N and DNA occupies more than half of the interface (Figure 1E). CENP-N interacts with the phosphate backbones along two successive minor grooves (with one major groove in between). The interacting phosphate backbones on nucleosomal DNA can be divided into four groups, +37/+36 nt, −32/−31 nt, +26/+25 nt and −22/−21 nt (Figure 1E). These four DNA sites interact with four distinct regions of CENP-N to form a large DNA-protein interface, indicating an important role of CENP-N-DNA interaction in the formation and stabilization of CENP-A NCP/CENP-LN complex (Figure 1E).Although sequence alignment reveals the conservation of RG loop motif, the lengths and/or sequences of RG loop differ in CENP-A from different species (Supplementary information, Figure S7A, S7B, S7C). Given that the specific recognition of CENP-A nucleosome by CENP-N is functionally conserved across these species, it is likely that the CENP-N from different species undergoes corresponding evolution to match the diverse RG loops of CENP-A. In contrast, CENP-N recognizes nucleosomal DNA in a sequence-independent manner by interacting with the phosphate backbones, suggesting an essential role of the positively-charged residues of CENP-N in DNA binding. To evaluate the effects of nucleosomal DNA binding by CENP-N on recognition of CENP-A NCP, we first generated several mutants of CENP-N1-214 by changing the conserved positively-charged amino acids to alanine based on the sequence alignment analysis of CENP-N orthologues from different species (Supplementary information, Figures S8 and S9). As shown in Figure 1F, mutations of K10, R11, R44, H77, K90 and R196 significantly reduced the CENP-A NCP binding affinity to CENP-N. Among these mutants, K10A, R11A, R44A and H77A showed obviously lower DNA binding ability, R196A slightly reduces the DNA interaction, whereas the DNA binding affinity of K90A is comparable to that of wild type (Figure 1G and Supplementary information, Figure S10). These findings indicate that residues K10, R11, R44 and H77 of CENP-N are critical for CENP-N binding to CENP-A NCP by directly interacting with nucleosomal DNA and are likely located at the interface between nucleosomal DNA and CENP-N.To investigate the function of CENP-N in the kinetochore, we introduced siRNA oligonucleotides against CENP-N into HeLa cells and examined mitotic progression using time-lapse microscopy. As shown in Figure 1H, suppression of CENP-N resulted in a high frequency of chromosome segregation defects, including chromosome misalignment and chromosome bridges. The defects seen in the CENP-N-deficient cells were largely rescued by an RNAi-resistant wild-type CENP-N, but not K10A, a DNA binding-deficient mutant of CENP-N, demonstrating the role of the DNA binding activity of CENP-N in mitotic chromosome movements (Figure 1I and Supplementary information, Figure S11). Careful analyses of CENP-N-suppressed HeLa cells revealed that CENP-N is essential for stable centromere localization of CENP-A and CENP-L but not CENP-E (Figure 1J and Supplementary information, Figure S12).Taken together, our study sheds lights on how CENP-N specifically recognizes CENP-A-containing chromatin and recruits CENP-L for kinetochore assembly. Recognition requires interactions of CENP-N with CENP-A RG loop, histone H2B αC helix and nucleosomal DNA. The RG loop is a unique marker in CENP-A Targeting Domain (CATD) discriminating CENP-A from H3 NCP, and is specifically recognized by CENP-N. The interactions of CENP-A RG loop and H2B αC helix with CENP-NN observed in our structure ensure CENP-N to bind on the CENP-A NCP surface at proper orientation, consistent with the significantly impaired interaction observed for mutations of R80-G813. In addition, we observed that the nucleosomal DNA makes a dominant contribution to stabilize the complex by associating with CENP-N via electrostatic interactions. Mutations of the key residues in CENP-N essential for DNA binding significantly reduced the interaction between CENP-N and CENP-A NCP in vitro and kinetochore localization of CENP-N in vivo. Given the fact that CENP-N is required for stable association of CENP-A and CENP-L but not CENP-E with the kinetochore, we reason that human kinetochores have evolved an elaborate kinetochore assembly machinery to ensure accurate chromosome segregation during cell division.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201813"
"cr","Eosinophil-derived CCL-6 impairs hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis","Eosinophils (Eos) have been long considered as end-stage effector cells in the hierarchical hematopoietic system. Numerous lines of evidence have suggested that Eos are multifunctional leukocytes with respect to the initiation, propagation and regulation of various inflammatory or immune reactions, especially in allergic diseases. Recent studies have shown that Eos are also required for maintenance of bone marrow plasma cells and differentiation of B cells. However, it remains unclear whether Eos contributes to regulation of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis. Here, we demonstrate that Eos disrupt HSC homeostasis by impairing HSC quiescence and reconstitution ability in wild-type mice following ovalbumin (OVA) challenge and even by causing bone marrow HSC failure and exhaustion in Cd3δ-Il-5 transgenic mice. The impaired maintenance and function of HSCs were associated with Eos-induced redox imbalance (increased oxidative phosphorylation and decreased anti-oxidants levels). More importantly, using mass spectrometry, we determined that CCL-6 is expressed at a high level under eosinophilia. We demonstrate that CCL-6 is Eos-derived and responsible for the impaired HSC homeostasis. Interestingly, blockage of CCL-6 with a specific neutralizing antibody, restored the reconstitution ability of HSCs while exacerbating eosinophilia airway inflammation in OVA-challenged mice. Thus, our study reveals an unexpected function of Eos/CCL-6 in HSC homeostasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20182"
"cr","H5N1 influenza virus-specific miRNA-like small RNA increases cytokine production and mouse mortality via targeting poly(rC)-binding protein 2","Infection of H5N1 influenza virus causes the highest mortality among all influenza viruses. The mechanisms underlying such high viral pathogenicity are incompletely understood. Here, we report that the H5N1 influenza virus encodes a microRNA-like small RNA, miR-HA-3p, which is processed from a stem loop-containing viral RNA precursor by Argonaute 2, and plays a role in enhancing cytokine production during H5N1 infection. Mechanistic study shows that miR-HA-3p targets poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) and suppresses its expression. Consistent with PCBP2 being an important negative regulator of RIG-I/MAVS-mediated antiviral innate immunity, suppression of PCBP2 expression by miR-HA-3p promotes cytokine production in human macrophages and mice infected with H5N1 virus. We conclude that miR-HA-3p is the first identified influenza virus-encoded microRNA-like functional RNA fragment and a novel virulence factor contributing to H5N1-induced 'cytokine storm' and mortality.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20183"
"cr","Mitochondrial metabolism and cancer","Glycolysis has long been considered as the major metabolic process for energy production and anabolic growth in cancer cells. Although such a view has been instrumental for the development of powerful imaging tools that are still used in the clinics, it is now clear that mitochondria play a key role in oncogenesis. Besides exerting central bioenergetic functions, mitochondria provide indeed building blocks for tumor anabolism, control redox and calcium homeostasis, participate in transcriptional regulation, and govern cell death. Thus, mitochondria constitute promising targets for the development of novel anticancer agents. However, tumors arise, progress, and respond to therapy in the context of an intimate crosstalk with the host immune system, and many immunological functions rely on intact mitochondrial metabolism. Here, we review the cancer cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic mechanisms through which mitochondria influence all steps of oncogenesis, with a focus on the therapeutic potential of targeting mitochondrial metabolism for cancer therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017155"
"cr","Structural basis for specific flagellin recognition by the NLR protein NAIP5","The nucleotide-binding domain- and leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing proteins (NLRs) function as intracellular immune receptors to detect the presence of pathogen- or host-derived signals. The mechanisms of how NLRs sense their ligands remain elusive. Here we report the structure of a bacterial flagellin derivative in complex with the NLR proteins NAIP5 and NLRC4 determined by cryo-electron microscopy at 4.28 Å resolution. The structure revealed that the flagellin derivative forms two parallel helices interacting with multiple domains including BIR1 and LRR of NAIP5. Binding to NAIP5 results in a nearly complete burial of the flagellin derivative, thus stabilizing the active conformation of NAIP5. The extreme C-terminal side of the flagellin is anchored to a sterically constrained binding pocket of NAIP5, which likely acts as a structural determinant for discrimination of different bacterial flagellins by NAIP5, a notion further supported by biochemical data. Taken together, our results shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying NLR ligand perception.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017148"
"cr","Human embryonic stem cells contribute to embryonic and extraembryonic lineages in mouse embryos upon inhibition of apoptosis","Recently, interspecies chimera formation has been established in rodents by injection of rat pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) into mouse early embryos, and such a system provides an in vivo assay to test the developmental potential of human PSCs (hPSCs)1. In addition, the interspecies chimeras formed between hPSCs and large animal embryos would open new avenues to generate human tissues and organs for regenerative medicine2. In rodents, embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) have been derived from inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst and post-implantation epiblast respectively3,4. Although both being pluripotent, the ESCs and EpiSCs are considered to represent two distinct states of pluripotency, the naïve and primed pluripotent state. Only naïve state ESCs can colonize the early embryos before the blastocyst stage to form adult chimeras and transmit to the germline, while the primed state EpiSCs can only integrate into the post-implantation embryos5,6. Intriguingly, although derived from the ICM, the human ESCs (hESCs) are similar to the mouse EpiSCs in many aspects such as the morphology and self-renewal pathways, hence they are considered to represent the primed pluripotent state. Several studies have reported the generation of human-animal interspecies chimeras using the stage-matching hESCs. For example, primed hPSCs were engrafted into in vitro cultured gastrula-stage mouse embryos to form chimeras, and the primed hPSCs were also converted into a naïve-like state and then were injected into pre-implantation embryos to form mouse or pig chimeras7,8,9. Recently, a non-stage-matching approach has been established to generate mouse-rat interspecies chimeras by inhibiting apoptosis of the primed ESCs10. We hence hypothesize that inhibition of apoptosis may enable the primed hESCs to form interspecies chimeras upon injection into mouse pre-implantation stage embryos.We used a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible system for transient induction of human anti-apoptotic genes, BCL2L1 or BCL2, together with the DsRed reporter gene, in hESCs carrying a constitutively expressed reporter gene GFP (Supplementary information, Figure S1A and S1B). The BCL2L1- and BCL2-overexpressing hESCs maintained their pluripotent state and could differentiate into embryoid bodies (EBs) expressing marker genes of all three germ layers (Supplementary information, Figure S1C-S1F). Compared with the control hESCs, the BCL2L1- and BCL2-overexpressing hESCs displayed much lower levels of spontaneous apoptosis and significantly higher single cell cloning efficiency (Supplementary information, Figure S1G and Figure 1A). Global gene expression profiles revealed that BCL2L1 and BCL2 overexpression had little effect on the hESC pluripotent state, as only 40 and 48 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the BCL2L1- and BCL2-overexpressing hESCs respectively, which were involved in functions related to cellular response to DNA damage stimuli and extracellular stimuli, and regulation of apoptotic process (Supplementary information, Figure S1H-S1K). Consistently, BCL2L1- and BCL2-overexpressing hESCs were clustered with the primed state hESCs but not with the previously reported naïve state hESCs by principal component analysis9, and did not upregulate naïve marker gene expression (Supplementary information, Figure S1L and S1M). Taken together, these results suggest that BCL2L1 or BCL2 overexpression can inhibit apoptosis in hESCs without affecting their pluripotent state.Figure 1Overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes enables hESCs to differentiate into embryonic and extraembryonic lineages in pre- and post-implantation mouse embryos.

(M) Illustrative model showing that inhibition of apoptosis promotes primed hESCs to form interspecies chimeras in mouse embryos.Full size imageNext, we investigated whether the inhibition of apoptosis could enable the hESCs to colonize early stage mouse embryos. A total of 76 blastocysts were generated from 89 4-cell embryos injected with BCL2L1-overexpressing hESCs, and 72 of them (∼95%) contained GFP-positive human cells. In contrast, GFP fluorescence was scarcely observed in the blastocysts injected with control hESCs due to apoptosis (Supplementary information, Figure S2A, S2B and Table S1, S2). Intriguingly, the hESCs contributed to both the ICM and trophectoderm (TE) of the chimeric blastocysts as confirmed by the GFP fluorescence and immunofluorescence staining against lineage-specific markers and the human nuclear antigen (hNA) in the chimeric blastocysts (Figure 1B and Supplementary information, Figure S2A). Statistical analysis showed that on average 13 hNA-positive cells were present in each chimeric blastocyst (Figure 1C).We next investigated the contribution of the BCL2L1- and BCL2-overexpressing hESCs in post-implantation mouse embryos (Figure 1D). Clear GFP signals were observed in the mouse embryos dissected at embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5), E8.5 and E10.5, indicating the presence of hESC-derived cells (Figure 1E). PCR analysis also detected the existence of the hESC-carried transgene in 5/10 dissected E6.5 embryos (Supplementary information, Figure S2C). Moreover, immunostaining of lineage-specific markers showed that the hESCs could differentiate into all three germ layers in E6.5 chimeric mouse embryos (Figure 1F). Analysis of E10.5 chimeric embryos also showed the differentiation of hESCs into FOXA2-expressing endoderm cells (Figure 1G). Of embryos dissected at E6.5, E8.5 and E10.5, around 80% (36 out of 45 fetuses), 44% (7 out of 16 fetuses) and 55% (12 out of 22 fetuses) contained GFP-positive human cells from the BCL2L1-overexpressing hESC injection group (Figure 1E and 1I). We next analyzed the proportions of human cells in chimeric embryos. 10 E8.5 chimeric embryos were analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and about 0.7% of total cells were GFP-positive (Supplementary information, Figure S2D). Immunostaining of the tissue sections of 5 E10.5 chimeric embryos, and a sensitive PCR assay to quantify the human mitochondrial DNA ratio at the whole-embryo level in 10 independent E10.5 chimeric embryos, both confirmed that the hESCs could contribute up to 1% of total cells in the post-implantation chimeric embryos (Figure 1H and Supplementary information, Figure S2E and S2F).Intriguingly, the presence of GFP signals could also be observed in the extraembryonic tissues such as the placenta and yolk sac at E10.5 (Figure 1J; Supplementary information, Figure S2G). The immunostaining assay further confirmed the incorporation of GFP-expressing cells into the junctional zone of E10.5 chimeric placenta (Figure 1K). Notably, the co-localization of GFP signal and CK7, a trophoblast marker, was also detected (Figure 1L). Moreover, PCR analysis validated the presence of the BCL2L1 transgene in 6 independent E10.5 chimeric placenta samples (Supplementary information, Figure S2H). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the BCL2L1- and BCL2-overexpressing hESCs could differentiate toward the extraembryonic lineages in post-implantation mouse embryos.In summary, we demonstrate here that inhibition of apoptosis of hESCs by overexpression of BCL2L1 and BCL2 enabled the hESCs to efficiently form interspecies human-mouse chimeras upon injection into 4-cell mouse embryos without affecting their pluripotent state (Figure 1M). This non-stage-matching approach for human-animal chimera production opens a new avenue to generate human organs in organ-deficient large animals. Moreover, the finding that the primed state hESCs could differentiate into extraembryonic lineages in vivo in mouse embryos, may shed light on the developmental potency of hESCs and the differences in pluripotency maintenance and regulation across species.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017138"
"cr","Endothelial cell-derived GABA signaling modulates neuronal migration and postnatal behavior","The cerebral cortex is essential for integration and processing of information that is required for most behaviors. The exquisitely precise laminar organization of the cerebral cortex arises during embryonic development when neurons migrate successively from ventricular zones to coalesce into specific cortical layers. While radial glia act as guide rails for projection neuron migration, pre-formed vascular networks provide support and guidance cues for GABAergic interneuron migration. This study provides novel conceptual and mechanistic insights into this paradigm of vascular-neuronal interactions, revealing new mechanisms of GABA and its receptor-mediated signaling via embryonic forebrain endothelial cells. With the use of two new endothelial cell specific conditional mouse models of the GABA pathway (Gabrb3ΔTie2-Cre and VgatΔTie2-Cre), we show that partial or complete loss of GABA release from endothelial cells during embryogenesis results in vascular defects and impairs long-distance migration and positioning of cortical interneurons. The downstream effects of perturbed endothelial cell-derived GABA signaling are critical, leading to lasting changes to cortical circuits and persistent behavioral deficits. Furthermore, we illustrate new mechanisms of activation of GABA signaling in forebrain endothelial cells that promotes their migration, angiogenesis and acquisition of blood-brain barrier properties. Our findings uncover and elucidate a novel endothelial GABA signaling pathway in the CNS that is distinct from the classical neuronal GABA signaling pathway and shed new light on the etiology and pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, anxiety, depression and schizophrenia.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017135"
"cr","Plasma membrane changes during programmed cell deaths","Ruptured and intact plasma membranes are classically considered as hallmarks of necrotic and apoptotic cell death, respectively. As such, apoptosis is usually considered a non-inflammatory process while necrosis triggers inflammation. Recent studies on necroptosis and pyroptosis, two types of programmed necrosis, revealed that plasma membrane rupture is mediated by MLKL channels during necroptosis but depends on non-selective gasdermin D (GSDMD) pores during pyroptosis. Importantly, the morphology of dying cells executed by MLKL channels can be distinguished from that executed by GSDMD pores. Interestingly, it was found recently that secondary necrosis of apoptotic cells, a previously believed non-regulated form of cell lysis that occurs after apoptosis, can be programmed and executed by plasma membrane pore formation like that of pyroptosis. In addition, pyroptosis is associated with pyroptotic bodies, which have some similarities to apoptotic bodies. Therefore, different cell death programs induce distinctive reshuffling processes of the plasma membrane. Given the fact that the nature of released intracellular contents plays a crucial role in dying/dead cell-induced immunogenicity, not only membrane rupture or integrity but also the nature of plasma membrane breakdown would determine the fate of a cell as well as its ability to elicit an immune response. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in the field of apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis, with an emphasis on the mechanisms underlying plasma membrane changes observed on dying cells and their implication in cell death-elicited immunogenicity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017133"
"cr","Derivation of hypermethylated pluripotent embryonic stem cells with high potency","Naive hypomethylated embryonic pluripotent stem cells (ESCs) are developmentally closest to the preimplantation epiblast of blastocysts, with the potential to contribute to all embryonic tissues and the germline, excepting the extra-embryonic tissues in chimeric embryos. By contrast, epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) resembling postimplantation epiblast are relatively more methylated and show a limited potential for chimerism. Here, for the first time, we reveal advanced pluripotent stem cells (ASCs), which are developmentally beyond the pluripotent cells in the inner cell mass but with higher potency than EpiSCs. Accordingly, a single ASC contributes very efficiently to the fetus, germline, yolk sac and the placental labyrinth in chimeras. Since they are developmentally more advanced, ASCs do not contribute to the trophoblast. ASCs were derived from blastocysts in two steps in a chemically defined medium supplemented with Activin A and basic fibroblast growth factor, followed by culturing in ABCL medium containing ActA, BMP4, CHIR99021 and leukemia inhibitory factor. Notably, ASCs exhibit a distinct transcriptome with the expression of both naive pluripotency genes, as well as mesodermal somatic genes; Eomes, Eras, Tdgf1, Evx1, hand1, Wnt5a and distinct repetitive elements. Conversion of established ESCs to ASCs is also achievable. Importantly, ASCs exhibit a stable hypermethylated epigenome and mostly intact imprints as compared to the hypomethylated inner cell mass of blastocysts and naive ESCs. Properties of ASCs suggest that they represent cells at an intermediate cellular state between the naive and primed states of pluripotency.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017134"
"cr","H7N9 virulent mutants detected in chickens in China pose an increased threat to humans","Certain low pathogenic avian influenza viruses can mutate to highly pathogenic viruses when they circulate in domestic poultry, at which point they can cause devastating poultry diseases and severe economic damage. The H7N9 influenza viruses that emerged in 2013 in China had caused severe human infections and deaths. However, these viruses were nonlethal in poultry. It is unknown whether the H7N9 viruses can acquire additional mutations during their circulation in nature and become lethal to poultry and more dangerous for humans. Here, we evaluated the evolution of H7N9 viruses isolated from avian species between 2013 and 2017 in China and found 23 different genotypes, 7 of which were detected only in ducks and were genetically distinct from the other 16 genotypes that evolved from the 2013 H7N9 viruses. Importantly, some H7N9 viruses obtained an insertion of four amino acids in their hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site and were lethal in chickens. The index strain was not lethal in mice or ferrets, but readily obtained the 627K or 701N mutation in its PB2 segment upon replication in ferrets, causing it to become highly lethal in mice and ferrets and to be transmitted efficiently in ferrets by respiratory droplet. H7N9 viruses bearing the HA insertion and PB2 627K mutation have been detected in humans in China. Our study indicates that the new H7N9 mutants are lethal to chickens and pose an increased threat to human health, and thus highlights the need to control and eradicate the H7N9 viruses to prevent a possible pandemic.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017129"
"cr","PRRT2 deficiency induces paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia by regulating synaptic transmission in cerebellum","Mutations in the proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) are associated with paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) and several other paroxysmal neurological diseases, but the PRRT2 function and pathogenic mechanisms remain largely obscure. Here we show that PRRT2 is a presynaptic protein that interacts with components of the SNARE complex and downregulates its formation. Loss-of-function mutant mice showed PKD-like phenotypes triggered by generalized seizures, hyperthermia, or optogenetic stimulation of the cerebellum. Mutant mice with specific PRRT2 deletion in cerebellar granule cells (GCs) recapitulate the behavioral phenotypes seen in Prrt2-null mice. Furthermore, recording made in cerebellar slices showed that optogenetic stimulation of GCs results in transient elevation followed by suppression of Purkinje cell firing. The anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine used in PKD treatment also relieved PKD-like behaviors in mutant mice. Together, our findings identify PRRT2 as a novel regulator of the SNARE complex and provide a circuit mechanism underlying the PRRT2-related behaviors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017128"
"cr","Intermittent fasting promotes adipose thermogenesis and metabolic homeostasis via VEGF-mediated alternative activation of macrophage","Intermittent fasting (IF), a periodic energy restriction, has been shown to provide health benefits equivalent to prolonged fasting or caloric restriction. However, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of IF-mediated metabolic benefits is limited. Here we show that isocaloric IF improves metabolic homeostasis against diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction primarily through adipose thermogenesis in mice. IF-induced metabolic benefits require fasting-mediated increases of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in white adipose tissue (WAT). Furthermore, periodic adipose-VEGF overexpression could recapitulate the metabolic improvement of IF in non-fasted animals. Importantly, fasting and adipose-VEGF induce alternative activation of adipose macrophage, which is critical for thermogenesis. Human adipose gene analysis further revealed a positive correlation of adipose VEGF-M2 macrophage-WAT browning axis.

Among them, Huntington disease (HD) is of particular interest because of its monogenetic nature. HD is mainly caused by cytotoxicity of the defective protein encoded by the mutant Huntingtin gene (HTT). Thus, lowering mutant HTT protein (mHTT) levels would be a promising treatment strategy for HD. Here we report two kinases HIPK3 and MAPK11 as positive modulators of mHTT levels both in cells and in vivo. Both kinases regulate mHTT via their kinase activities, suggesting that inhibiting these kinases may have therapeutic values. Interestingly, their effects on HTT levels are mHTT-dependent, providing a feedback mechanism in which mHTT enhances its own level thus contributing to mHTT accumulation and disease progression. Importantly, knockout of MAPK11 significantly rescues disease-relevant behavioral phenotypes in a knockin HD mouse model. Collectively, our data reveal new therapeutic entry points for HD and target-discovery approaches for similar diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017113"
"cr","A high-quality genome assembly of quinoa provides insights into the molecular basis of salt bladder-based salinity tolerance and the exceptional nutritional value","Chenopodium quinoa is a halophytic pseudocereal crop that is being cultivated in an ever-growing number of countries. Because quinoa is highly resistant to multiple abiotic stresses and its seed has a better nutritional value than any other major cereals, it is regarded as a future crop to ensure global food security. We generated a high-quality genome draft using an inbred line of the quinoa cultivar Real. The quinoa genome experienced one recent genome duplication about 4.3 million years ago, likely reflecting the genome fusion of two Chenopodium parents, in addition to the γ paleohexaploidization reported for most eudicots. The genome is highly repetitive (64.5% repeat content) and contains 54 438 protein-coding genes and 192 microRNA genes, with more than 99.3% having orthologous genes from glycophylic species. Stress tolerance in quinoa is associated with the expansion of genes involved in ion and nutrient transport, ABA homeostasis and signaling, and enhanced basal-level ABA responses. Epidermal salt bladder cells exhibit similar characteristics as trichomes, with a significantly higher expression of genes related to energy import and ABA biosynthesis compared with the leaf lamina. The quinoa genome sequence provides insights into its exceptional nutritional value and the evolution of halophytes, enabling the identification of genes involved in salinity tolerance, and providing the basis for molecular breeding in quinoa.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017124"
"cr","Structural basis for BIR1-mediated negative regulation of plant immunity","Plant receptor kinases (RKs) can function as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) for perception of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to induce immune responses1,2. One of such PRRs is the leucine-rich repeat RK (LRR-RK) FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2) that recognizes bacteria-derived flagellin (flg22 epitope)3,4. The smaller LRR-RK BRI1-associated kinase 1 (BAK1) acts as a co-receptor with FLS25,6.The Arabidopsis LRR-RK BAK1-interacting receptor-like kinase 1 (BIR1) was initially identified through a reverse genetic screen and the phenotypes of bir1-1 can be suppressed by the adapter LRR-RK SOBIR1 (suppressor of BIR1)7. SOBIR1 interacted with BAK1 in planta when the expression of BIR1 was silenced, suggesting that BIR1 sequesters BAK1 from SOBIR1 in resting cells to inhibit cell death and immune responses8. All four BIR members (BIR1-BIR4) in Arabidopsis interacted with BAK1 when expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. Like bir1, BAK1-interacting receptor-like kinase 2 (bir2) mutants also display enhanced SA-dependent cell-death9. BIR2 also has a critical role in negative regulation of flg22-induced responses by controlling BAK1-FLS2 complex formation in a ligand-dependent manner9.We first examined BAK1-BIR1 interaction using their extracellular LRR portions expressed in insect cells. BIR1LRR and BAK1LRR formed a stable heterodimeric complex at pH 6.0 in gel filtration (Figure 1A, Supplementary information, Figure S1), which was further confirmed by native gel analysis of the gel filtration fractions (Figure 1B). The BAK1LRR-BIR1LRR interaction was further supported by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and Sedimentation-Velocity Analytical UltraCentrifugation (SV-AUC) analyses (Supplementary information, Figure S2). At pH 4.0, BAK1LRR and BIR1LRR still interacted with each other (Supplementary information, Figure S3A) in gel filtration. However, BAK1LRR lost its activity of interacting with BIR1LRR at pH 8.0 (Supplementary information, Figure S3B). These results indicate that the BAK1LRR-BIR1LRR interaction in vitro is pH-dependent, which is further supported by the ITC data (Supplementary information, Figure S4). Similar to BIR1LRR, BIR3LRR and BIR4LRR also displayed interaction with BAK1LRR at pH 6.0 (Supplementary information, Figure S5A, S5C, S5D). But unlike BIR1LRR, BIR3LRR and BIR4LRR still interacted with BAK1LRR at pH 8.0 in both gel filtration and ITC assays (Supplementary information, Figure S6A, S6C, S6D). Compared to BIR1LRR, BIR3LRR and BIR4LRR, BIR2LRR exhibited a much weaker affinity towards BAK1LRR at pH 6.0 (Supplementary information, Figure S5A, S5B). Like BIR1LRR, BIR2LRR also had no detectable interaction with BAK1LRR at pH 8.0 in gel filtration and ITC assays (Supplementary information, Figure S6A, S6B). These biochemical data indicate that BIR1-4 and BAK1 directly interact with each other through their ecto-domains.Figure 1Interaction between BAK1LRR and BIR1LRR is required for BIR1 inhibition of BAK1-mediated plant immunity.

The numbers shown on the top of the gels indicate elution volumes (mL). MM: molecular weight maker.Full size imageTo probe the molecular mechanism underlying BIRLRR-BAK1LRR interaction, we solved the crystal structure of the complex (Figure 1C). Interaction between the two proteins is mediated by packing of one lateral side of BIR1LRR against the C-terminal inner surface and the C-terminal capping domain of BAK1LRR(Figure 1C). Specifically, a loop region from the N-terminal capping domain of BIR1LRR makes extensive contacts with BAK1LRR(Figure 1C). While the overall structure of BIR1LRR remarkably resembles that of BAK1LRR (Supplementary information, Figure S7A), the loop regions from these two proteins are strikingly different in their conformations and primary sequences (Supplementary information, Figure S7).The BIR1LRR-BAK1LRR interaction is mediated by both polar and hydrophobic contacts, and can be divided into two interfaces (Figure 1C). One is mainly mediated by packing of the loop region from the N-terminal capping domain of BIR1LRR against the C-terminal inner surface of BAK1LRR. Interaction between one lateral side of BIR1LRR and one short helix of BAK1LRR forms the other interface (Figure 1D). Trp71 of BIR1LRR from the first interface forms extensive interactions with BAK1LRR by being sandwiched by Val168, Asp170 and Ile192 of BAK1LRR(Figure 1D, Supplementary information, Figure S8). Several hydrogen bonds also contribute to the interaction around this interface. At the other interface, Thr190 positioned immediately underneath the C-terminal capping domain of BAK1LRR tightly stacks against Phe150 of BIR1LRR, and Thr128 of BIR1LRR and Leu188 of BAK1LRR forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond (Figure 1D and Supplementary information, Figure S8).To confirm our structural observations, we chose two residues from the centers and two from the peripheries of the BAK1LRR-BIR1LRR interfaces for mutagenesis analyses. In support of the structure, mutating Trp71 in BIR1 to the smaller alanine residue resulted in loss of interaction with BAK1LRR (Figure 1E, Supplementary information, Figure S9A). Mutations in the equivalent residues in BIR2LRR (W73), BIR3LRR (W67) and BIR4LRR (W60) caused similar effects on their interaction with BAK1LRR (Supplementary information, Figure S10). Similarly, mutating Thr190 in BAK1 to arginine (Figure 1F, Supplementary information, Figure S9B) and His72 in BIR1 to asparagine (Supplementary information, Figure S11) also resulted in no detectable BAK1LRR-BIR1LRR interaction. In contrast, mutating Val168 in BAK1 to arginine compromised but did not abolish the BAK1LRR-BIR1LRR interaction as indicated by the results of gel filtration and ITC assays (Supplementary information, Figure S12).We then used the luciferase (LUC) complementation assay to test the effect of the above mutations on BIR1-BAK1 interaction in N. benthamiana. Co-infiltration of Agrobacteria containing BAK1-CLuc and BIR1-NLuc, resulted in strong LUC activity (Supplementary information, Figure S13A). In support of our biochemical data, the BIR1 W71A and BAK1 T190R mutations greatly reduced the LUC activity generation (Supplementary information, Figure S13B, S13C). In contrast, the BAK1 V168R and BIR1 H72N mutations only modestly affected the LUC activity (Supplementary information, Figure S13D, S13E). The positive control BIR1 T103Q mutation, found in other BIR proteins (Supplementary information, Figure S14) and located between the two BAK1-BIR1 interfaces (Supplementary information, Figure S8B), did not impact BIR1 interaction with BAK1 in the assay (Supplementary information, Figure S13A). The reduced interaction was not caused by difference in protein levels as the wild type and mutant BAK1-CLuc and BIR1-NLuc proteins were expressed at comparable levels (Supplementary information, Figure S13F).We then generated transgenic plants and examined their defense responses. The bir1-1::BIR1 (W71A) but not the bir1-1::BIR1 (T103Q) transgenic plants displayed seeding lethality phenotype, phenocopying the bir1-1 mutant (Figure 1G). Furthermore, expression levels of pathogenesis-related genes PR1 and PR2 were upregulated in bir1-1::BIR1 (W71A) but not in bir1-1::BIR1 (T103Q) plants (Figure 1H, Supplementary information, Figure S15A). Supporting our biochemical and cell-based assays, expression of BAK1 (T190R) but not wild type BAK1 or BAK1 (V168R) led to plant dwarfism, constitutive expression of PR1 and PR2 and increased resistance to Hyaloperonospora parasitica Noco2 (Figure 1G, 1I, 1J, Supplementary information, Figures S15B and S16). These results suggest that defense responses were constitutively activated in the BAK1 (T190R) transgenic plants. Different from the bir1-1::BIR1 (W71A) plants, the bir1-1::BIR1 (H72N) plants had wild type morphology, did not constitutively express PR genes, and were fully susceptible to the virulent oomycete pathogen Hyaloperonospora parasitica Noco2 (Supplementary information, Figure S17). The precise reason for the discrepancy between these functional data and the in vitro biochemical data remains unclear.Structural comparison between BAK1LRR-BIR1LRR and FLS2LRR-flg22-BAK1LRR showed that the C-terminal portion of FLS2LRR, which interacts with BAK1LRR, completely overlaps with BIR1LRR(Figure 1K), suggesting that the flg22-bound FLS2 may compete with BIR1LRR to release BAK1LRR from the BIR1LRR-BAK1LRR complex. Supporting this hypothesis, BAK1LRR from the pre-incubated BAK1LRR-BIR1LRR complex formed a stable interaction with FLS2LRR-flg22 at pH 6.0 (Figure 1L), indicating that the BAK1LRR-BIR1LRR interaction had been outcompeted by FLS2LRR-flg22.Our study shows that the ecto-domains of BIR1 and BAK1 are sufficient for them to interact with each other in vitro and the interaction is critical to the inhibition of BAK1 function by BIR1. Consistently, over-expression of the ecto-domain together with the trans-membrane segment of BAK1 in plants phenocopies the BAK1-overexpressing phenotypes, presumably through sequestering BIR110. Our primary sequence analysis (Supplementary information, Figure S14) suggests that all 4 BIR members may share a common mechanism of interacting with BAK1. We also showed that the flg22-bound FLS2 outcompeted BIR1LRR for binding to BAK1LRR, even with an excess of BIR1LRR, explaining the observation that BIR1 has no effect on FLS2-mediated immune responses7. Release of the BIR1-sequestered BAK1 by the flg22-bound FLS2 could become easier by an increase in pH during flg22-induced plant immunity. BIR1 has likely evolved to keep BAK1-mediated cell death signaling under tight control, thus preventing undesired autoimmunity. The observation that the ecto-domain of BIR1 is sufficient for inhibition of BAK1 suggests that the signal relieving BIR1-mediated inhibition of BAK1, if present, comes from the extracellular space.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017123"
"cr","5-Hydroxymethylcytosine signatures in circulating cell-free DNA as diagnostic biomarkers for human cancers","DNA modifications such as 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are epigenetic marks known to affect global gene expression in mammals. Given their prevalence in the human genome, close correlation with gene expression and high chemical stability, these DNA epigenetic marks could serve as ideal biomarkers for cancer diagnosis. Taking advantage of a highly sensitive and selective chemical labeling technology, we report here the genome-wide profiling of 5hmC in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and in genomic DNA (gDNA) of paired tumor and adjacent tissues collected from a cohort of 260 patients recently diagnosed with colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, liver or thyroid cancer and normal tissues from 90 healthy individuals. 5hmC was mainly distributed in transcriptionally active regions coincident with open chromatin and permissive histone modifications. Robust cancer-associated 5hmC signatures were identified in cfDNA that were characteristic for specific cancer types. 5hmC-based biomarkers of circulating cfDNA were highly predictive of colorectal and gastric cancers and were superior to conventional biomarkers and comparable to 5hmC biomarkers from tissue biopsies. Thus, this new strategy could lead to the development of effective, minimally invasive methods for diagnosis and prognosis of cancer from the analyses of blood samples.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017121"
"cr","A vital sugar code for ricin toxicity","Ricin is one of the most feared bioweapons in the world due to its extreme toxicity and easy access. Since no antidote exists, it is of paramount importance to identify the pathways underlying ricin toxicity. Here, we demonstrate that the Golgi GDP-fucose transporter Slc35c1 and fucosyltransferase Fut9 are key regulators of ricin toxicity. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of fucosylation renders diverse cell types resistant to ricin via deregulated intracellular trafficking. Importantly, cells from a patient with SLC35C1 deficiency are also resistant to ricin. Mechanistically, we confirm that reduced fucosylation leads to increased sialylation of Lewis X structures and thus masking of ricin-binding sites. Inactivation of the sialyltransferase responsible for modifications of Lewis X (St3Gal4) increases the sensitivity of cells to ricin, whereas its overexpression renders cells more resistant to the toxin. Thus, we have provided unprecedented insights into an evolutionary conserved modular sugar code that can be manipulated to control ricin toxicity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017116"
"cr","Enhanced base editing by co-expression of free uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor","Base editors (BEs) have been recently developed by combining the APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like)/AID (activation-induced deaminase) cytidine deaminase family members1 with the CRISPR/Cas9 system to perform targeted C-to-T base editing2, 3, 4, 5,6,7,8. Mechanistically, Cas9 variant-fused APOBEC/AID is directed to target site by sgRNA, introducing C-to-T substitution at the single-base level2,3,4. Compared to earlier generations of BEs (BE1 and BE2), the latest BE3 achieved much higher base editing frequencies by substituting catalytically-dead Cas9 (dCas9) with Cas9 nickase (nCas9)2. Because BEs achieve gene corrections without introducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), unwanted indels converted from DSBs through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) were thought to be excluded in base editing. However, non-negligible levels of indels (∼4%-12% in published cases2,3) were still observed in BE3-mediated base editing. In addition, unwanted non-C-to-T (i.e., C-to-A or C-to-G) substitutions were observed, and the frequencies of C-to-A/C-to-G substitutions could be as high as that of C-to-T substitution in some examined cases5. The existence of unwanted indels and C-to-A/C-to-G substitutions compromises the fidelity of base editing outcome.Thus, understanding what causes the formation of those unwanted indels and C-to-A/C-to-G substitutions during base editing will help achieve a cleaner yield of BE3. Ideally, along with the U:G mismatch introduced by APOBEC-mediated cytidine deamination on the non-target strand (NTS), the nCas9-generated nick on the sgRNA target strand (TS) activates mismatch repair (MMR) pathway9,10 to excise the nicked TS (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). Subsequent TS DNA re-synthesis using the edited NTS as a template converts the original U:G mismatch into a U:A pair, whereby the desired C-to-T substitution is achieved after DNA replication (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). However, the U on the single-stranded NTS could also be transformed into an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site by various DNA glycosylases, including uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG)11 (Supplementary information, Figure S1C), to trigger other DNA repair pathways. For instance, AP endonuclease-mediated cleavage or spontaneous breakage of AP site-containing ssDNA could trigger NHEJ to form indels (Supplementary information, Figure S1C, left); additionally, translesion synthesis (TLS) over the AP site by TLS DNA polymerase could result in a C-to-A or C-to-G substitution (Supplementary information, Figure S1C, right). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that preventing the transformation of the APOBEC-generated U into AP site on the single-stranded NTS could reduce unwanted indels and non-C-to-T substitutions. Uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) domain was fused to nCas9 in BE3 to prevent the transformation of U into AP site. To test the importance of UGI in base editing, we first removed the fused UGI in BE3. Consistent with our hypothesis mentioned above (Supplementary information, Figure S1C), the UGI-deleted BE3 (BE3-ΔUGI; Supplementary information, Figure S2A) was less competent in base editing (Supplementary information, Figure S2B-S2L). Compared to BE3, BE3-ΔUGI induced higher unwanted indel frequencies and lower desired C-to-T editing (Supplementary information, Figure S2B-S2D, P < 0.01 and Figure S2E-S2G, P < 10−5). As a consequence, the ratios of C-to-T editing to indels decreased considerably (Supplementary information, Figure S2H-S2J, P < 10−6). Meanwhile, the unwanted C-to-A/C-to-G substitutions also increased in the absence of UGI (Supplementary information, Table S2), leading to a significant reduction of C-to-T over C-to-A/C-to-G substitutions (Supplementary information, Figure S2K-S2L, P < 10−4). These results thus indicated that preventing the transformation of U into AP site is pivotal for efficient and high-fidelity base editing.Although UGI was fused to nCas9 in BE3, indels were still observed in reported studies2,3. Such a phenomenon suggests that additional UGI activity may be required to further improve the efficiency and fidelity of BE3-mediated base editing. We therefore tested this hypothesis by co-expressing UGI in trans with BE3. After co-transfection of UGI in trans with sgRNA/BE3 in 293FT cells (Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Figure S3A and S3B), we applied deep-sequencing to determine the indel and base substitution frequencies at three sgRNA target sites. Compared to BE3 alone, co-expressing BE3 and UGI in trans evidently reduced the indel frequencies (Figure 1B and 1C, P < 10−6, Supplementary information, Table S1) and promoted C-to-T editing frequencies at target bases (Figure 1D and 1E, P < 10−5; Supplementary information, Table S2). Specifically, the expression level of UGI is positively correlated with the ratio of C-to-T editing to indels (Figure 1F). When a high level of free UGI is present, the ratio of desired base editing to unwanted indels increased by ∼6-fold (Figure 1G, P < 10−4). At the same time, the unwanted C-to-A/C-to-G substitutions were also suppressed in most tested cases by free UGI expression (Supplementary information, Table S2), resulting in a significant increase of C-to-T over C-to-A/C-to-G substitutions (Figure 1H and 1I, P < 10−6). We noticed that the variations among biological replicates were not trivial (Figure 1B, 1D and 1F, standard deviation represented by error bar), which could be explained by the different transfection efficiencies among replicates. To exclude the influence of transfection efficiency among different biological replicates, we normalized the indel frequencies, C-to-T editing frequencies and the ratios of editing to indels induced in BE3/UGI co-expression by those induced in paired BE3 tests. As illustrated in Supplementary information, Figure S3C-S3E, consistently better base editing effects were observed in BE3/UGI co-expression than in BE3. Moreover, the statistical analysis indicates that those improving effects conferred by high level of free UGI were highly significant (Figure 1C, 1E and 1G, P values were all within the range of 10−6 to 10−4). These results indicated that additional free UGI could reduce AP site formation on single-stranded NTS, thereby suppressing the generation of unwanted indels and C-to-A/C-to-G substitutions and simultaneously increasing the desired C-to-T editing.Figure 1Enhanced base editing system. (A-I) Enhanced base editing by co-expressing BE3 and free UGI from separate vectors in 293FT cells. Schematic diagram illustrating the design of sgRNA, BE3 and UGI expression vectors (A). The indel frequency (B), the C-to-T editing frequency at the indicated position of the sgRNA target region (D), the ratio of desired C-to-T editing to unwanted indels (F) and the fractions of C-to-T, C-to-A and C-to-G substitutions (H) were individually determined at the specified genomic sites for the indicated conditions and plotted as follows: orange represents BE3, faint blue represents BE + low UGI, blue represents BE3 + medium UGI, dark blue represents BE3 + high UGI and black represents dCas9.

(B, D, F, K, M and O) Error bars (±), standard deviations of 3 replicates. (C, E, G, I, L, N, P and R) P values, one-tailed Student's t-test.Full size imageWe next sought to set up the enhanced BE (eBE) more conveniently by using a single vector to co-express BE3 with either one (eBE-S1) or three (eBE-S3) copies of 2A-UGI sequence (Figure 1J). After being transfected into 293FT cells together with five sgRNAs targeting different genomic loci, both eBEs showed lower indel frequencies and higher C-to-T editing frequencies than the original BE3 (Figure 1K and 1M; Supplementary information, Tables S1 and S2); eBE-S3, with three copies of 2A-UGI and the highest level of UGI expression (Supplementary information, Figure S4A), displayed the most robust and highly significant effect (Figure 1K-1N, P < 10−8-10−4; Supplementary information, Figure S4B and S4C, Tables S1 and S2). Consistently, the ratios of C-to-T editing to indels were elevated when either eBE was used (Figure 1O and 1P, P < 10−4 for eBE-S3; Supplementary information, Figure S4D). Moreover, the C-to-A/C-to-G substitutions were also suppressed by eBEs (Supplementary information, Table S2) and eBE-S3 induced a highly significant increase of C-to-T fractions over C-to-A/C-to-G (Figure 1Q and 1R, P < 10−9). It is worth noting that the nCas9-fused UGI domain is still important for achieving high fidelity of base editing, even when high levels of free UGI is present (data not shown). Such facts corroborate the importance of preventing U from transforming into AP site and are consistent with our hypothesis presented above (Supplementary information, Figure S1C).Next, we tested the effects of co-expressing BE3 and free UGI in another cell line, HeLa (Supplementary information, Figure S5). Compared to BE3, co-expressing free UGI from a separate or the same vector both induced significantly lower indel frequencies (Supplementary information, Figure S5B-S5D), higher C-to-T editing frequencies (Supplementary information, Figure S5E-S5G), higher ratios of C-to-T editing to indels (Supplementary information, Figure S5H-S5J) and higher C-to-T fractions over C-to-A/C-to-G (Supplementary information, Figure S5K and S5L). Taken together, these results indicated that our enhanced base editing system can improve the efficiency and outcome fidelity of base editing, leading to more accurate gene editing at the single-base level.In conclusion, we have developed an enhanced base editing system by co-expressing BE3 together with free UGI. This enhanced base editing system not only suppressed the formation of unwanted indels and substitutions but also increased the frequency of C-to-T editing, thereby improving both the fidelity and efficiency of base editing. In conditions such as therapy-related applications of BEs, the 'cleanness' of editing is pursued. Our finding thus provides a method to further improve BEs for cleaner editing outcomes. Since new BEs utilizing nCas9s with altered PAMs have recently been developed4, our enhanced base editing strategy reported here could also be used to improve the fidelity and efficiency of these newly emerged BEs.Materials and Methods are available in Supplementary information, Data S1, Tables S3 and S4.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017111"
"cr","Pairing of integrins with ECM proteins determines migrasome formation","Recently we reported the discovery of migrasome, a new organelle of migrating cells1. Migrasomes are large vesicles that grow on the tips or intersections of retraction fibers at the rear of migrating cells. Following cell migration, the retraction fibers eventually break and the migrasomes become detached. The migrasomes and their contents, including cytosolic components and vesicles of unknown origin, are released into the extracellular space —— a process we named as migracytosis. We speculated that migracytosis may play important roles in cell-cell communication.Integrins are a large family of transmembrane receptors that connect cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM). Integrins function as heterodimers composed of α and β subunits; there are 18 α and 8 β integrins in mammals2. Different integrins bind to different ECM proteins2. For example, integrin α5β1 specifically binds to fibronectin, α3β1 to laminins, and α1β1 and α2β1 to collagens3.When cells migrate away, migrasomes adhere to the place where they are formed, which indicates that something holds the migrasome at its formation site. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed integrin α5β1 is enriched on migrasomes (unpublished data), suggesting this integrin is a possible candidate for the molecule that holds the migrasome on the ECM. To testify this hypothesis, we used MGC803 cells expressing TSPAN4-GFP that labels migrasomes, and stained the cells with antibodies against integrin α5 and β1. We found that both integrin α5 and β1 were enriched in migrasomes (Figure 1A). Moreover, using two antibodies which specifically recognize different epitopes of activated integrin β1 (clone HUTS-4 and 12G10), we found migrasome-localized β1 was in its activated ligand-binding state (Figure 1B), which indicates that the migrasomal integrin binds the ECM.Figure 1(A) Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of integrin α5 (ITGA5) and β1 (ITGB1) in MGC803 cell line overexpressing TSPAN4-GFP.

(F) TSPAN4-GFP-expressing NRK cells were cultured on different ECM proteins (fibronectin, laminin 511 and collagen I), and the number of migrasomes formed on each was counted. (G) The expression level of different integrin α subunits in TSPAN4-GFP-expressing NRK cells was analyzed by qPCR. (H) TSPAN4-GFP-expressing NRK cells were transfected with control or ITGA5-targeting siRNA for more than 24 h, then plated on the FN-, LN511- or Col I-coated chamber overnight, and confocal pictures regarding migrasome number for each cell were taken. The western blotting analysis (the right panel) showed the knocking down efficiency. (I) NRK cells expressing TSPAN4-GFP alone (control) or TSPAN4-GFP with mCherry-tagged integrin α3 were cultured on different ECM proteins and the number of migrasomes per cell was counted. Data were analyzed with two-tailed t-tests (GraphPad Prism 5); ***P < 0.001. (J) CHO cells were transfected with pEGFP-N1 (control) or integrin α1-GFP and seeded into chambers coated with different ECM proteins, and the number of migrasomes per cell was counted. Data were analyzed with two-tailed t-tests (GraphPad Prism 5); ***P < 0.001.Full size imageTo study the migrasomal integrin in more detail, we transfected integrin α5-GFP into normal rat kidney cells expressing TSPAN4-mCherry (NRK-TSPAN4-mCherry). We found that integrin α5-GFP was highly enriched in migrasomes, whereas there was relatively less integrin α5-GFP on retraction fibers (Figure 1C). Time-lapse analysis revealed that during migrasome growth, small integrin-positive puncta first appeared on retraction fibers, and these integrin-positive puncta grew gradually and soon became TSPAN4-positive migrasomes (Figure 1D). Thus, the formation of integrin puncta appears to specify the site of migrasome formation.Migrasomes are spherical structures, so if integrin molecules adhere migrasomes to the ECM, they must be located at the bottom of the migrasome. To test this hypothesis, we checked the 3D distribution of integrin α5 and TSPAN4 on migrasomes. We found that integrin α5 was mainly enriched on the bottom side of migrasomes while TSPAN4 was on the upper side (Figure 1E). Similarly, TIRF microscopy imaging revealed that endogenous integrin α5 and β1 were enriched on the bottom of migrasomes (Supplementary information, Figure S1A and S1B). Taken together, these data on the spatio-temporal distribution pattern of integrin on migrasomes further support our hypothesis that integrin α5β1 adheres migrasomes to the ECM and may play important roles in migrasome formation.Focal adhesions (FAs) are the sites that cells are linked to the ECM. Integrins are highly enriched in FAs4. We wondered whether the integrin-enriched regions on migrasomes are FAs. To test this idea, we co-transfected cells with various FA markers (paxillin, vinculin or zyxin)5 and TSPAN4. We found that none of these FA markers was localized on migrasomes (Supplementary information, Figure S2A-S2C). Moreover, the average lifetime of migrasomes is about 200 min, whereas the FAs are much more dynamic, with the lifetime of < 1 h (Supplementary information, Figure S2D). These data suggest that the integrin-enriched site on the bottom of the migrasome is not an FA. Interestingly, substrate-attached materials, which are cellular feet that remain on substrates after the treatment of adherent cells with EGTA, also contain integrins but not FA components6.Different integrins bind and adhere to different ECM proteins. We reasoned that migrasome formation may depend on the matching of specific integrin-ECM pairs. To test this hypothesis, we cultured TSPAN4-GFP-expressing NRK cells (NRK-TSPAN4-GFP) on different ECM proteins. We found that NRK-TSPAN4-GFP cells produced many more migrasomes on cover glasses coated with fibronectin than with laminin 511 or collagen I, whereas very few migrasomes formed on non-coated cover glasses (Figure 1F). Next, we checked the expression level of various integrins in NRK-TSPAN4-GFP cells, including integrin α1 and α2 that bind collagen I and IV, α3 and α6 that bind laminin 511, and α5 that binds fibronectin. We found that NRK-TSPAN4-GFP cells expressed much higher levels of α5 than other integrins (Figure 1G). Furthermore, knockdown of ITGA5 that encodes α5 impaired the formation of migrasomes on cells cultured on fibronectin, but not on other ECMs (Figure 1H). Thus, migrasome formation on NRK-TSPAN4-GFP cells is likely dependent on integrin α5-fibronectin pairing.In NRK-TSPAN4-GFP cells, the expression level of integrin α3 is very low. We overexpressed integrin α3-mCherry in NRK-TSPAN4-GFP cells, and found that it significantly enhanced migrasome formation on cover glasses coated with laminin 511, but not on cover glasses covered with other ECM proteins (Figure 1I). Due to the reason that GFP-tagged integrin α1 does not express well in NRK-TSPAN4-GFP cells, we used CHO cells to test whether integrin α1 can promote migrasome formation on paired ECM protein. Similarly, overexpression of GFP-tagged integrin α1 in CHO cells enhanced the formation of migrasomes on collagen IV, which has the highest binding affinity to integrin α1, but not on other ECM proteins (Figure 1J). Furthermore, overexpression of integrin α1 and α3 increased cell spreading and migration on their respective ECM partner protein (Supplementary information, Figure S3). This implies that integrin α3 and α1 may affect migrasome formation by regulating cell migration and adhesion. Similarly, overexpression of α3 and α1 in MGC803 cells, which have low endogenous levels of α3 and α1, also enhanced the formation of migrasomes on the respective ECM partner protein, but not on unmatched ECM proteins (Supplementary information, Figure S4). Based on these data, we conclude that the pairing of integrin with its specific ECM partner is a determinant for migrasome formation.Migrasome formation depends on cell migration1. Formation of retraction fibers requires adherence of at least a portion of the retraction fiber to the cell surface to provide a tethering point, which enables the retraction fiber to be pulled from the trailing end of the cell as the cell migrates. The fact that integrins are enriched on the bottom of migrasomes, and that migrasomes are largely stationary while retraction fibers are often swaying around (Supplementary information, movie S1) indicates that the migrasome is the point of adhesion which tethers the retraction fibers to the ECM. Thus, integrins may play dual roles in migrasome formation: the integrins on the cell body enable the cell to migrate, whereas the integrin on the migrasome provides the adhesion for retraction fiber tethering.In this report, we found that activated integrin is highly enriched on the bottom of migrasomes, and we further demonstrated that the expression level of integrin affects migrasome formation. Finally, we showed that the correct pairing of integrin with its specific ECM partner protein is a determinant for migrasome formation.There are 18 α and 8 β integrins in mammals and their expression is subject to various regulatory mechanisms. Different integrins bind different ECM proteins2, and each ECM protein has a specific spatial and temporal distribution pattern in a given organism. Thus, our finding that pairing of integrins with their specific ECM partner proteins is a determinant for migrasome formation may emerge as an important principle for determining where and when migrasomes can be generated in vivo.So far, the detection of migrasomes has depended on TSPAN4, a marker we identified in our original paper. In this regard, integrins may serve as more specific markers for migrasomes (Figure 1A-1C and Supplementary information, movie S2). While both TSPAN4 and integrins are highly enriched on migrasomes, unlike TSPAN4 that is also abundant on retraction fibers, integrins are only present at very low levels on retraction fibers. Excellent integrin antibodies are available commercially, and thus they may emerge as important tools for studying migrasomes in vivo.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017108"
"cr","Twa1/Gid8 is a β-catenin nuclear retention factor in Wnt signaling and colorectal tumorigenesis","Hyperactivation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is one of the major causes of human colorectal cancer (CRC). A hallmark of Wnt signaling is the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. Although β-catenin nuclear import and export have been widely investigated, the underlying mechanism of β-catenin's nuclear retention remains largely unknown. Here, we report that Twa1/Gid8 is a key nuclear retention factor for β-catenin during Wnt signaling and colorectal carcinogenesis. In the absence of Wnt, Twa1 exists together with β-catenin in the Axin complex and undergoes ubiquitination and degradation. Upon Wnt signaling, Twa1 translocates into the nucleus, where it binds and retains β-catenin. Depletion of Twa1 attenuates Wnt-stimulated gene expression, dorsal development of zebrafish embryos and xenograft tumor growth of CRC cells. Moreover, nuclear Twa1 is significantly upregulated in human CRC tissues, correlating with the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and poor prognosis. Thus, our results identify Twa1 as a previously undescribed regulator of the Wnt pathway for promoting colorectal tumorigenesis by facilitating β-catenin nuclear retention.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017107"
"cr","5-Hydroxymethylcytosine signatures in cell-free DNA provide information about tumor types and stages","5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is an important mammalian DNA epigenetic modification that has been linked to gene regulation and cancer pathogenesis. Here we explored the diagnostic potential of 5hmC in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) using a sensitive chemical labeling-based low-input shotgun sequencing approach. We sequenced cell-free 5hmC from 49 patients of seven different cancer types and found distinct features that could be used to predict cancer types and stages with high accuracy. Specifically, we discovered that lung cancer leads to a progressive global loss of 5hmC in cfDNA, whereas hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer lead to disease-specific changes in the cell-free hydroxymethylome. Our proof-of-principle results suggest that cell-free 5hmC signatures may potentially be used not only to identify cancer types but also to track tumor stage in some cancers.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017106"
"cr","IPA1 functions as a downstream transcription factor repressed by D53 in strigolactone signaling in rice","Strigolactones (SLs), a group of carotenoid derived terpenoid lactones, are root-to-shoot phytohormones suppressing shoot branching by inhibiting the outgrowth of axillary buds. DWARF 53 (D53), the key repressor of the SL signaling pathway, is speculated to regulate the downstream transcriptional network of the SL response. However, no downstream transcription factor targeted by D53 has yet been reported. Here we report that Ideal Plant Architecture 1 (IPA1), a key regulator of the plant architecture in rice, functions as a direct downstream component of D53 in regulating tiller number and SL-induced gene expression. We showed that D53 interacts with IPA1 in vivo and in vitro and suppresses the transcriptional activation activity of IPA1. We further showed that IPA1 could directly bind to the D53 promoter and plays a critical role in the feedback regulation of SL-induced D53 expression. These findings reveal that IPA1 is likely one of the long-speculated transcription factors that act with D53 to mediate the SL-regulated tiller development in rice.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2017102"
"cr","Cardiotrophin 1 stimulates beneficial myogenic and vascular remodeling of the heart","The post-natal heart adapts to stress and overload through hypertrophic growth, a process that may be pathologic or beneficial (physiologic hypertrophy). Physiologic hypertrophy improves cardiac performance in both healthy and diseased individuals, yet the mechanisms that propagate this favorable adaptation remain poorly defined. We identify the cytokine cardiotrophin 1 (CT1) as a factor capable of recapitulating the key features of physiologic growth of the heart including transient and reversible hypertrophy of the myocardium, and stimulation of cardiomyocyte-derived angiogenic signals leading to increased vascularity. The capacity of CT1 to induce physiologic hypertrophy originates from a CK2-mediated restraining of caspase activation, preventing the transition to unrestrained pathologic growth. Exogenous CT1 protein delivery attenuated pathology and restored contractile function in a severe model of right heart failure, suggesting a novel treatment option for this intractable cardiac disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201787"
"cr","Non-canonical regulation of SPL transcription factors by a human OTUB1-like deubiquitinase defines a new plant type rice associated with higher grain yield","Achieving increased grain productivity has long been the overriding focus of cereal breeding programs. The ideotype approach has been used to improve rice yield potential at the International Rice Research Institute and in China. However, the genetic basis of yield-related traits in rice remains unclear. Here, we show that a major quantitative trait locus, qNPT1, acts through the determination of a 'new plant type' (NPT) architecture characterized by fewer tillers, sturdier culms and larger panicles, and it encodes a deubiquitinating enzyme with homology to human OTUB1. Downregulation of OsOTUB1 enhances meristematic activity, resulting in reduced tiller number, increased grain number, enhanced grain weight and a consequent increase in grain yield in rice. Unlike human OTUB1, OsOTUB1 can cleave both K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin. OsOTUB1 interacts with the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating protein OsUBC13 and the squamosa promoter-binding protein-like transcription factor OsSPL14. OsOTUB1 and OsSPL14 share common target genes, and their physical interaction limits K63-linked ubiquitination (K63Ub) of OsSPL14, which in turn promotes K48Ub-dependent proteasomal degradation of OsSPL14. Conversely, loss-of-function of OsOTUB1 is correlated with the accumulation of high levels of OsSPL14, resulting in the NPT architecture. We also demonstrated that pyramiding of high-yielding npt1 and dep1-1 alleles provides a new strategy for increasing rice yield potential above what is currently achievable.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201798"
"cr","Smad5 acts as an intracellular pH messenger and maintains bioenergetic homeostasis","Both environmental cues and intracellular bioenergetic states profoundly affect intracellular pH (pHi). How a cell responds to pHi changes to maintain bioenergetic homeostasis remains elusive. Here we show that Smad5, a well-characterized downstream component of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling responds to pHi changes. Cold, basic or hypertonic conditions increase pHi, which in turn dissociates protons from the charged amino acid clusters within the MH1 domain of Smad5, prompting its relocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. On the other hand, heat, acidic or hypotonic conditions decrease pHi, blocking the nuclear export of Smad5, and thus causing its nuclear accumulation. Active nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of Smad5 induced by environmental changes and pHi fluctuation is independent of BMP signaling, carboxyl terminus phosphorylation and Smad4. In addition, ablation of Smad5 causes chronic and irreversible dysregulation of cellular bioenergetic homeostasis and disrupted normal neural developmental processes as identified in a differentiation model of human pluripotent stem cells. Importantly, these metabolic and developmental deficits in Smad5-deficient cells could be rescued only by cytoplasmic Smad5. Cytoplasmic Smad5 physically interacts with hexokinase 1 and accelerates glycolysis. Together, our findings indicate that Smad5 acts as a pHi messenger and maintains the bioenergetic homeostasis of cells by regulating cytoplasmic metabolic machinery.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201785"
"cr","Single-cell multi-omics sequencing of mouse early embryos and embryonic stem cells","Single-cell epigenome sequencing techniques have recently been developed. However, the combination of different layers of epigenome sequencing in an individual cell has not yet been achieved. Here, we developed a single-cell multi-omics sequencing technology (single-cell COOL-seq) that can analyze the chromatin state/nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, copy number variation and ploidy simultaneously from the same individual mammalian cell. We used this method to analyze the reprogramming of the chromatin state and DNA methylation in mouse preimplantation embryos. We found that within < 12 h of fertilization, each individual cell undergoes global genome demethylation together with the rapid and global reprogramming of both maternal and paternal genomes to a highly opened chromatin state. This was followed by decreased openness after the late zygote stage. Furthermore, from the late zygote to the 4-cell stage, the residual DNA methylation is preferentially preserved on intergenic regions of the paternal alleles and intragenic regions of maternal alleles in each individual blastomere. However, chromatin accessibility is similar between paternal and maternal alleles in each individual cell from the late zygote to the blastocyst stage. The binding motifs of several pluripotency regulators are enriched at distal nucleosome depleted regions from as early as the 2-cell stage. This indicates that the cis-regulatory elements of such target genes have been primed to an open state from the 2-cell stage onward, long before pluripotency is eventually established in the ICM of the blastocyst. Genes may be classified into homogeneously open, homogeneously closed and divergent states based on the chromatin accessibility of their promoter regions among individual cells. This can be traced to step-wise transitions during preimplantation development. Our study offers the first single-cell and parental allele-specific analysis of the genome-scale chromatin state and DNA methylation dynamics at single-base resolution in early mouse embryos and provides new insights into the heterogeneous yet highly ordered features of epigenomic reprogramming during this process.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201782"
"cr","Live cell screening platform identifies PPARδ as a regulator of cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac repair","Zebrafish can efficiently regenerate their heart through cardiomyocyte proliferation. In contrast, mammalian cardiomyocytes stop proliferating shortly after birth, limiting the regenerative capacity of the postnatal mammalian heart. Therefore, if the endogenous potential of postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation could be enhanced, it could offer a promising future therapy for heart failure patients. Here, we set out to systematically identify small molecules triggering postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation. By screening chemical compound libraries utilizing a Fucci-based system for assessing cell cycle stages, we identified carbacyclin as an inducer of postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation. In vitro, carbacyclin induced proliferation of neonatal and adult mononuclear rat cardiomyocytes via a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ (PPARδ)/PDK1/p308Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway. Inhibition of PPARδ reduced cardiomyocyte proliferation during zebrafish heart regeneration. Notably, inducible cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of constitutively active PPARδ as well as treatment with PPARδ agonist after myocardial infarction in mice induced cell cycle progression in cardiomyocytes, reduced scarring, and improved cardiac function. Collectively, we established a cardiomyocyte proliferation screening system and present a new drugable target with promise for the treatment of cardiac pathologies caused by cardiomyocyte loss.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201784"

UraA consists of 14 transmembrane segments (TMs) that are organized into two distinct domains, the core domain and the gate domain, a structural fold that is also shared by the SLC4 and SLC26 transporters. Here we present the crystal structure of UraA bound to uracil in an occluded state at 2.5 Å resolution. Structural comparison with the previously reported inward-open UraA reveals pronounced relative motions between the core domain and the gate domain as well as intra-domain rearrangement of the gate domain. The occluded UraA forms a dimer in the structure wherein the gate domains are sandwiched by two core domains. In vitro and in vivo biochemical characterizations show that UraA is at equilibrium between dimer and monomer in all tested detergent micelles, while dimer formation is necessary for the transport activity. Structural comparison between the dimeric UraA and the recently reported inward-facing dimeric UapA provides important insight into the transport mechanism of SLC23 transporters.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201783"

Here we show that single gene or multiple genes can be completely knocked out in mouse and monkey embryos by zygotic injection of Cas9 mRNA and multiple adjacent single-guide RNAs (spaced 10-200 bp apart) that target only a single key exon of each gene. Phenotypic analysis of F0 mice following targeted deletion of eight genes on the Y chromosome individually demonstrated the robustness of this approach in generating knockout mice. Importantly, this approach delivers complete gene knockout at high efficiencies (100% on Arntl and 91% on Prrt2) in monkey embryos. Finally, we could generate a complete Prrt2 knockout monkey in a single step, demonstrating the usefulness of this approach in rapidly establishing gene-edited monkey models.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201781"
"cr","Molecular assembly of rhodopsin with G protein-coupled receptor kinases","G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) play pivotal roles in desensitizing GPCR signaling but little is known about how GRKs recognize and phosphorylate GPCRs due to the technical difficulties in detecting the highly dynamic GPCR/GRK interaction. By combining a genetic approach with multiple biochemical assays, we identified the key determinants for the assembly of the prototypical GPCR rhodopsin with its kinase GRK1. Our work reveals that the regulatory G-protein signaling homology (RH) domain of GRKs is the primary binding site to GPCRs and an active conformation of the GRK1 kinase domain is required for efficient interaction with rhodopsin. In addition, we provide a mechanistic solution for the longstanding puzzle about the gain-of-function Q41L mutation in GRK5. This mutation is in the RH domain and increases the capacity of the GRK mutant to interact with and to desensitize GPCRs. Finally we present the principal architecture of a rhodopsin/GRK complex through negative stain electron microscopy reconstruction. Together, these data define the key components for the rhodopsin/GRK1 interaction and provide a framework for understanding GRK-mediated desensitization of GPCRs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201772"
"cr","Homology-mediated end joining-based targeted integration using CRISPR/Cas9","Targeted integration of transgenes can be achieved by strategies based on homologous recombination (HR), microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The more generally used HR is inefficient for achieving gene integration in animal embryos and tissues, because it occurs only during cell division, although MMEJ and NHEJ can elevate the efficiency in some systems. Here we devise a homology-mediated end joining (HMEJ)-based strategy, using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cleavage of both transgene donor vector that contains guide RNA target sites and ∼800 bp of homology arms, and the targeted genome. We found no significant improvement of the targeting efficiency by the HMEJ-based method in either mouse embryonic stem cells or the neuroblastoma cell line, N2a, compared to the HR-based method. However, the HMEJ-based method yielded a higher knock-in efficiency in HEK293T cells, primary astrocytes and neurons. More importantly, this approach achieved transgene integration in mouse and monkey embryos, as well as in hepatocytes and neurons in vivo, with an efficiency much greater than HR-, NHEJ- and MMEJ-based strategies. Thus, the HMEJ-based strategy may be useful for a variety of applications, including gene editing to generate animal models and for targeted gene therapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201776"
"cr","A unique deubiquitinase that deconjugates phosphoribosyl-linked protein ubiquitination","Ubiquitination regulates many aspects of host immunity and thus is a common target for infectious agents. Recent studies have revealed that members of the SidE effector family of the bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila attack several small GTPases associated with the endoplasmic reticulum by a novel ubiquitination mechanism that does not require the E1 and E2 enzymes of the host ubiquitination machinery. In this case, ubiquitin is first activated by ADP-ribosylation at Arg42 by a mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity; the intermediate is then cleaved by a phosphodiesterase activity also residing within SdeA, concomitant with the attachment of ubiquitin to serine residues of substrate proteins via a phosphoribosyl linker. Here we demonstrate that the effect of SidEs is antagonized by SidJ, an effector encoded by a gene situated in the locus coding for three members of the SidE family (SdeC, SdeB and SdeA). SidJ reverses ubiquitination of SidEs-modified substrates by cleaving the phosphodiester bond that links phosphoribosylated ubiquitin to protein substrates. SidJ also displays classical deubiquitinase activity but does not require catalytic cysteine residues. Further, these deubiquitinase activities of SidJ are essential for its role in L. pneumophila infection. Finally, the activity of SidJ is required for efficiently reducing the abundance of ubiquitinated Rab33b in infected cells within a few hours after bacterial uptake. Our results establish SidJ as a ubiquitin-deconjugating enzyme that functions to impose temporal regulation on the activity of SidE effectors. SidJ may be important in future studies of signaling cascades mediated by this unique ubiquitination, one that also potentially regulates cellular processes in eukaryotic cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201766"
"cr","Clonal analysis reveals remarkable functional heterogeneity during hematopoietic stem cell emergence","In conventional opinion, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are alike, possessing robust self-renewal and multilineage differentiation capacity. However, growing evidence has revealed striking functional heterogeneity among individual HSCs, particularly in the aspect of lymphomyeloid output1,2,3. Four subtypes of HSCs with distinct differentiation patterns have been identified and designated as α-, β-, γ-, and δ-HSCs4. Only lymphoid-deficient (α) and lymphomyeloid-balanced (β) HSCs bear durable engraftment potential and extensive self-renewal activity5. Although differentiation program of individual HSCs can be stably self-propagated, occasional occurrence of inter-conversions among programs has also been observed5. HSC heterogeneity exhibits developmental stage-related fluctuation, especially regarding the prevalence of α-HSCs, being minor in fetal liver but high in aging bone marrow (BM)5. The arising concept of HSC heterogeneity leads to a series of key questions, as to its embryonic origin, regulatory mechanisms, and relationship with leukemogenesis and therapeutics.The first transplantable adult-like HSCs become detectable in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region of mice around embryonic day (E) 10.56. At this time, the AGM region contains at least two types of pre-HSCs7, characterized by a high expression level of CD2018. Pre-HSCs possess abundant expression of endothelial signature genes and can develop into bona fide HSCs after co-culture with stromal cells and cytokines in vitro. It is of great interest but remains unknown whether and to what extent HSC heterogeneity presents when pre-HSCs and HSCs emerge in mid-gestation embryos.Approximately 3 AGM regions at E11.0 (40-44 somite pairs, sp) contain only one mature HSC. This frequency markedly increases to one HSC per AGM at E11.5 (45-48 sp)9. To ensure rigorous clonal analysis, we dissected E11 AGM tissues, with each AGM equally divided into 2 (E11.0) or 3 (E11.5) aliquots for subsequent direct transplantation into lethally irradiated adult mice. Recipients demonstrating ≥ 1% donor-derived white blood cells (WBCs) in peripheral blood after a minimum of 4 months were considered to be long-term reconstituted (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). Out of 139 recipients, 54 demonstrated successful long-term (> 4 months) reconstitution. 14 recipients repopulated by both aliquots from 7 E11.0 embryos were ruled out, and the remaining 40 were used for further analyses (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). The results are highly reminiscent of previous data using limiting dilution assay9,10, ensuring the reconstitution at a clonal level.Designation of HSC subtypes is mainly based on calculating the ratio of donor-derived contribution to granulocytes (G) plus monocytes (M) versus to B and T lymphocytes (GM/(B+T)). Namely, α- and β-HSCs are defined as GM/(B+T) ≥ 2 and 0.25-2, respectively. The left populations (GM/(B+T) ≤ 0.25) are further divided according to whether donor contribution to GM is ≥ 1% (γ-HSCs) or not (δ-HSCs)4,5. Our analysis showed that E11 AGM regions contained only two HSC subtypes. The majority (34/40, 85%) were γ-HSCs and the remaining 15% (6/40) were β-HSCs (Figure 1A-1B). The kinetics of average lineage contributions showed obviously distinct patterns between β-HSCs and γ-HSCs from 2 to 6 months post-transplantation, particularly regarding contributions to the GM lineage (Figure 1C).Figure 1Characterization of HSC and pre-HSC subtypes in E11 AGM.

All data are collected over 4 months post-transplantation.

(L) Pie charts showing subtypes of pre-HSCs and HSCs across developmental stages. Data of fetal liver and BM are from the study by the Eaves group5. wk, weeks.Full size imageInterestingly, unlike HSCs in adult BM4, some B lymphoid lineage-dominant γ-HSCs were observed in E11 AGM (Figure 1B). Using the k-means algorithm, 34 γ-HSCs were further separated into 2 distinct clusters (Figure 1D). Based on the corresponding distribution on the ternary graph, 9 were designated as B lymphoid lineage-dominant (B-dominant) γ-HSCs, with GM/(B+T) ≤ 0.25 and B/(GM+T) ≥ 1.5, and the other 25 were defined as lymphoid lineages-balanced (balanced) γ-HSCs (Supplementary information, Figure S2A). Compared to balanced γ-HSCs, B-dominant γ-HSCs showed impaired T lymphoid and more severely deficient myeloid differentiation potentials (Figure 1E).Similar to what was observed in adult BM4, embryonic β-HSCs demonstrated a significantly higher reconstitution ability than γ-HSCs. Moreover, B-dominant γ-HSCs displayed a remarkably lower reconstitution ability than balanced γ-HSCs (Figure 1F and (Supplementary information, Figure S2B). Unlike balanced γ-HSCs showing a sustained reconstitution, B-dominant γ-HSCs manifested decreased reconstitution levels over time (Figure 1F). These data suggest that the most limited repopulating potential of HSCs during midgestation is related to their compromised ability to differentiate into myeloid and T lymphoid lineages.In adult BM, β-HSCs display extensive self-renewal activity, whereas γ-HSCs fail to repopulate secondary recipients4,5. We performed secondary transplantations using 3 primary recipients of β-HSCs and 5 primary recipients of balanced γ-HSCs. Cells from the 3 primary recipients of β-HSCs reconstituted 9 of 18 secondary recipients (Supplementary information, Figure S2C-S2D). Unexpectedly, only 1 secondary recipient displayed a β-HSC differentiation pattern, whereas the other 8 showed a balanced γ-HSC differentiation pattern (Figure 1G and Supplementary information, Figure S2D). Interestingly, cells from 4 out of 5 primary recipients of balanced γ-HSCs reconstituted 13 of 23 secondary recipients (Supplementary information, Figure S2C-S2D). Among them, 11 maintained the balanced γ-HSC pattern, and the other 2 showed a B-dominant γ-HSC feature, highly suggesting preservation of differentiation programs of balanced γ-HSCs (Figure 1G and Supplementary information, Figure S2D). Thus, embryonic β-HSCs can give rise to both β- and γ-HSCs, and the embryonic γ-HSCs can only give rise to γ-HSCs, supporting a higher hierarchy of β-HSCs than that of γ-HSCs, in line with what was observed in BM4,5. In contrast to adult BM4,5, E11 AGM regions contain predominantly γ-HSCs but less β-HSCs. Moreover, embryonic balanced γ-HSCs showed a much stronger self-renewal potential than those in adults, whereas embryonic β-HSCs showed a limited preservation of their differentiation pattern upon secondary transplantation.We have recently established a strategy to efficiently isolate individual AGM-derived pre-HSCs8. We performed co-culture/transplantation assays initiated with single pre-HSCs from E11 AGM. The 22 repopulated recipients, including 12 receiving type 1 (T1, CD45-negative) and 10 receiving type 2 (T2, CD45-positive) pre-HSCs, displayed either a β or γ differentiation pattern (Figure 1H and Supplementary information, Figure S2E). There were totally 10 β-pre-HSCs (6 T1 and 4 T2), 10 balanced γ-pre-HSCs (5 T1 and 5 T2), and only 2 B-dominant γ-pre-HSCs (Figure 1H and Supplementary information, Figure S2F). β-pre-HSCs showed significantly higher reconstitution ability than γ-pre-HSCs (Figure 1I). The donor contributions to GM lineage in recipients of β-pre-HSCs were dramatically higher than those in recipients of γ-pre-HSCs at 4 months post-transplantation, and this was not seen regarding donor contributions to B and T lymphoid lineages (Figure 1J and Supplementary information, Figure S2G). Notably, α- or δ-pre-HSCs were undetectable, consistent with results of direct transplantation with AGM HSCs (Supplementary information, Figure S2F).Finally, we analyzed a recently reported dataset of singe-cell RNA-seq of multiple HSC-competent populations8. Out of 77 hematopoietic lineage-differentiation genes, 36 genes showed significantly differential expression between embryonic (pre-HSCs and fetal liver HSCs) and adult populations, most of which (29/36) displayed higher expression levels in the former (Supplementary information, Figure S2H). Among these 29 genes, 17 are related to lymphoid lineage differentiation and the expression level distributions of these genes in the fetal liver HSCs were usually either like those in pre-HSCs or similar to those in BM HSCs, suggesting a gradual change of the differentiation programs along with development (Figure 1K).In summary, our study unveils a heterogeneity in pre-HSC/HSC composition in E11 mouse embryos, indicating that functional heterogeneity in HSCs exists from the very beginning of embryonic HSC emergence and persists throughout the whole lifespan4,5 (Figure 1L). This study reveals at least two major HSC subtypes closely associated with the wall of large arteries during the course of HSC emergence, prior to the colonization of mature HSCs to fetal liver. The mechanism for the absence of α-HSCs deserves further investigations, which might be related to the influence of the microenvironment5. In addition, we are searching for candidate surface markers that can be used to isolate certain subtypes of pre-HSCs and HSCs in various hemogenic and hematopoietic niches.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201764"
"cr","Gene and mutation independent therapy via CRISPR-Cas9 mediated cellular reprogramming in rod photoreceptors","We report a gene therapy strategy using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated cellular reprogramming by switching a mutation-venerable/sensitive cell type to a mutation-insensitive/resistant cell type, therefore restoring tissue architecture and function. We applied this strategy to retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a major cause of blindness characterized by retinal rod photoreceptor degeneration caused by numerous mutations in many genes. By reprogramming rod to cone-like photoreceptors in situ by inactivating Nrl or Nr2e3, we show an increase in cone-like cells with remarkable concomitant preservation of both cone and rod photoreceptors and retinal tissue, with restoration of visual function. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of cellular reprogramming in preventing degeneration and preserving tissue and function, and points to a novel approach in treating human diseases in a gene and mutation independent manner.Gene therapy shows great promise in treating many human diseases, yet a major drawback of the current technology is that it can only be directed to a particular mutation or a single gene at best. This makes it difficult to apply gene therapy to a spectrum of diseases and a broad patient population. Similarly, repair and regeneration of tissues using endogenous stem cells represents an important goal in regenerative medicine and promising efforts have been demonstrated in mouse liver1, zebra fish heart2, and human lens3. However, the starting cells used to regenerate tissues must possess normal genetic makeup and function, which represents a challenge in many cases of human disease. One approach to overcome the above drawbacks in tissue repair and regeneration is therapeutic cellular reprogramming, which switches a cell type sensitive to a mutation to a functionally related cell type that is resistant to the same mutation. Therefore, this strategy would render the underlying mutation irrelevant, with consequent preservation of tissue architecture and function.We tested this hypothesis on RP, a retinal rod photoreceptor-specific disease. RP is one of the most common degenerative diseases of the eye, affecting over one million patients worldwide. RP is characterized by primary rod photoreceptor death and degeneration, followed by secondary cone death4. It can be caused by numerous mutations in over 200 genes, which limits the therapeutic impact of conventional gene therapy strategies. Acute gene knockout of rod determinant Nrl was shown to reprogram adult rods into cone-like cells, rendering them resistant to effects of mutations in RP-specific genes and consequently preventing secondary cone loss5. Nrl acts as a master switch gene between rods and cones and activates a key downstream transcription factor Nr2e3. Nrl and Nr2e3 function in concert to activate a rod-specific gene transcription network and control rod differentiation and fate6. Loss of function in either Nrl or Nr2e3 reprograms rods to a cone cell fate.To test a CRISPR/Cas9-based cellular reprogramming strategy to treat RP, we employed two AAV vectors, one expressing Cas9, and another carrying gRNAs targeting the Nrl or Nr2e3 gene (Figure 1A a, b). To assess if simultaneously targeting two sites by two gRNAs in the same gene has a higher targeting and inactivation efficiency than that by a single gRNA, we designed constructs that have either one or two gRNAs targeting Nrl or Nr2e3. We tested gene mutagenesis rates in mouse fibroblasts using a T7E1 nuclease assay, which cuts a mismatched double stranded DNA template. The results showed that the two-gRNA system had a much higher editing efficiency than that of a single-guide RNA (Supplementary information, Figure S1A a, b). We therefore adopted a double gRNA targeting strategy in all subsequent in vivo experiments.Figure 1(A) AAV vector construction. a.

FVB/N mice were injected at P7 and tested at P50 (*P < 0.05, Student's t-test, n = 6).Full size imageWe next delivered the two gRNAs/Cas9 constructs using AAV vectors to normal mice via subretinal injection at postnatal day 7 (P7) and sacrificed mice for histology at P30. Retinas were frozen-sectioned and stained for cone markers, including cone arrestin (mCAR) and short wavelength opsin (S-opsin)7. We observed a reprogrammed photoreceptor phenotype with two gRNAs in vivo. In normal retinas, cone nuclei reside at the top layer of outer nuclear layer (ONL), while rod nuclei fill the rest of ONL (Figure 1B a). We observed there were many mCAR+ cells in the lower ONL areas in retinas treated with Nrl gRNAs/Cas9 or Nr2e3 gRNAs/Cas9 (Figure 1B a, b). The extra mCAR+ cells at the lower ONL areas have a normal outer segment (Figure 1B c). Consistent with activation of a cone-like gene expression program, these mCAR+ cells were also positive for another cone-specific marker S-opsin (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). We used quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to measure the relative expression levels of rod or cone genes in reprogrammed retinas and controls. As expected, there was down-regulation of rod-specific genes with concomitant upregulation of cone-specific genes (Supplementary information, Figure S1C).Next, to explore the possibility of using the CRISPR/Cas9-based strategy for gene therapy in RP, we targeted Nrl or Nr2e3 in two different RP animal models. Rd10 mice represent a common model for autosomal recessive RP in humans with rod photoreceptor degeneration8. We injected AAV-gRNAs/Cas9 into the subretinal space of rd10 mice at P7. To determine the effect of AAV-gRNAs/Cas9 treatment, electroretinography (ERG) responses were tested in eyes of live mice to measure the electrical activity of cone photoreceptors (photopic response) at P60. All eyes treated with AAV-gRNAs/Cas9 exhibited significantly improved photopic b-wave values, suggesting improved cone function (Figure 1C d, Supplementary information, Figure S2C). Scotopic ERG result showed no change of a-wave, while there was a small but significant increase of scotopic b-wave amplitude at higher light intensity levels (Supplementary information, Figure S2A-S2B). Consistent with the visual function improvement, histology analysis of the AAV-gRNAs/Cas9-treated-rd10 retinas showed preservation of a number of mCAR+ cells (Figure 1C a, b). In addition, AAV-gRNAs/Cas9 treatment led to significantly improved preservation of the ONL thickness compared with non-injected control as well as preservation of cells positive for S-opsin and PNA staining (Figure 1C c, Supplementary information, Figure S1D).The FVB/N mouse strain provides another model of rapid photoreceptor degeneration9, which is caused by another mutation in PDE. We injected AAV-gRNAs/Cas9 into the subretinal space at P7, and tested ERG responses at P50, followed by histology analysis. Consistent with results from rd10 mice, histology analysis of the AAV-gRNAs/Cas9-treated FVB/N retinas showed greater preservation of mCAR+ cells and significantly improved preservation of ONL thickness (Figure 1D a-c). The eyes treated with AAV-gRNAs/Cas9 also exhibited significantly improved photopic b-wave values, suggesting improved cone function (Figure 1D d).In this study, we showed that targeted inactivation of Nrl or Nr2e3 via CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing can reprogram rod to cone-like photoreceptors, rescue retinal rod and cone degeneration and restore visual function in two different mouse RP models. In addition, our double gRNA strategy towards a single gene significantly increased targeting efficiency. In RP, cone photoreceptor death with consequent loss of day light and color vision function has the most severe impact on patient quality of life, yet it appears to be secondary to rod death. Our cellular reprogramming approach significantly rescues and restores both rod and cone function. This reprogramming strategy is especially attractive as the natural course of the disease inevitably results in loss of both rods and cones at an advanced stage, which eventually leads to legal blindness.Our approach shows promise of cellular reprogramming in preventing degeneration and restoring tissue function, and points to a novel approach in treating human diseases in a gene and mutation independent manner.Note added in proof: an independent study with similar results has been published recently in Nat Commun10.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201757"
"cr","Neurons secrete miR-132-containing exosomes to regulate brain vascular integrity","Vascular integrity helps maintain brain microenvironment homeostasis, which is critical for the normal development and function of the central nervous system. It is known that neural cells can regulate brain vascular integrity. However, due to the high complexity of neurovascular interactions involved, understanding of the neural regulation of brain vascular integrity is still rudimentary. Using intact zebrafish larvae and cultured rodent brain cells, we find that neurons transfer miR-132, a highly conserved and neuron-enriched microRNA, via secreting exosomes to endothelial cells (ECs) to maintain brain vascular integrity. Following translocation to ECs through exosome internalization, miR-132 regulates the expression of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin), an important adherens junction protein, by directly targeting eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eef2k). Disruption of neuronal miR-132 expression or exosome secretion, or overexpression of vascular eef2k impairs VE-cadherin expression and brain vascular integrity. Our study indicates that miR-132 acts as an intercellular signal mediating neural regulation of the brain vascular integrity and suggests that the neuronal exosome is a novel avenue for neurovascular communication.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201762"
"cr","5-methylcytosine promotes mRNA export — NSUN2 as the methyltransferase and ALYREF as an m5C reader","5-methylcytosine (m5C) is a post-transcriptional RNA modification identified in both stable and highly abundant tRNAs and rRNAs, and in mRNAs. However, its regulatory role in mRNA metabolism is still largely unknown. Here, we reveal that m5C modification is enriched in CG-rich regions and in regions immediately downstream of translation initiation sites and has conserved, tissue-specific and dynamic features across mammalian transcriptomes. Moreover, m5C formation in mRNAs is mainly catalyzed by the RNA methyltransferase NSUN2, and m5C is specifically recognized by the mRNA export adaptor ALYREF as shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. NSUN2 modulates ALYREF's nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, RNA-binding affinity and associated mRNA export. Dysregulation of ALYREF-mediated mRNA export upon NSUN2 depletion could be restored by reconstitution of wild-type but not methyltransferase-defective NSUN2. Our study provides comprehensive m5C profiles of mammalian transcriptomes and suggests an essential role for m5C modification in mRNA export and post-transcriptional regulation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201755"
"cr","Fasting-induced hormonal regulation of lysosomal function","Lysosomes are centers for nutrient sensing and recycling that allow mammals to adapt to starvation. Regulation of lysosome dynamics by internal nutrient signaling is well described, but the mechanisms by which external cues modulate lysosomal function are unclear. Here, we describe an essential role of the fasting-induced hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in lysosome homeostasis in mice. Fgf21 deficiency impairs hepatic lysosomal function by blocking transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis and autophagy. FGF21 induces mobilization of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, which activates the transcriptional repressor downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator (DREAM), and thereby inhibits expression of Mid1 (encoding the E3 ligase Midline-1). Protein phosphatase PP2A, a substrate of MID1, accumulates and dephosphorylates TFEB, thereby upregulating genes involved in lysosome biogenesis, autophagy and lipid metabolism. Thus, an FGF21-TFEB signaling axis links lysosome homeostasis with extracellular hormonal signaling to orchestrate lipid metabolism during fasting.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201745"
"cr","Intracellular HMGB1 as a novel tumor suppressor of pancreatic cancer","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) driven by oncogenic K-Ras remains among the most lethal human cancers despite recent advances in modern medicine. The pathogenesis of PDAC is partly attributable to intrinsic chromosome instability and extrinsic inflammation activation. However, the molecular link between these two events in pancreatic tumorigenesis has not yet been fully established. Here, we show that intracellular high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) remarkably suppresses oncogenic K-Ras-driven pancreatic tumorigenesis by inhibiting chromosome instability-mediated pro-inflammatory nucleosome release. Conditional genetic ablation of either single or both alleles of HMGB1 in the pancreas renders mice extremely sensitive to oncogenic K-Ras-driven initiation of precursor lesions at birth, including pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, and mucinous cystic neoplasms. Loss of HMGB1 in the pancreas is associated with oxidative DNA damage and chromosomal instability characterized by chromosome rearrangements and telomere abnormalities. These lead to inflammatory nucleosome release and propagate K-Ras-driven pancreatic tumorigenesis. Extracellular nucleosomes promote interleukin 6 (IL-6) secretion by infiltrating macrophages/neutrophils and enhance oncogenic K-Ras signaling activation in pancreatic lesions. Neutralizing antibodies to IL-6 or histone H3 or knockout of the receptor for advanced glycation end products all limit K-Ras signaling activation, prevent cancer development and metastasis/invasion, and prolong animal survival in Pdx1-Cre;K-RasG12D/+;Hmgb1−/− mice. Pharmacological inhibition of HMGB1 loss by glycyrrhizin limits oncogenic K-Ras-driven tumorigenesis in mice under inflammatory conditions. Diminished nuclear and total cellular expression of HMGB1 in PDAC patients correlates with poor overall survival, supporting intracellular HMGB1 as a novel tumor suppressor with prognostic and therapeutic relevance in PDAC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201751"
"cr","Self-inflicted DNA double-strand breaks sustain tumorigenicity and stemness of cancer cells","DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are traditionally associated with cancer through their abilities to cause chromosomal instabilities or gene mutations. Here we report a new class of self-inflicted DNA DSBs that can drive tumor growth irrespective of their effects on genomic stability. We discover a mechanism through which cancer cells cause DSBs in their own genome spontaneously independent of reactive oxygen species or replication stress. In this mechanism, low-level cytochrome c leakage from the mitochondria leads to sublethal activation of apoptotic caspases and nucleases, which causes DNA DSBs. In response to these spontaneous DNA DSBs, ATM, a key factor involved in DNA damage response, is constitutively activated. Activated ATM leads to activation of transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3, known drivers of tumor growth. Moreover, self-inflicted DNA DSB formation and ATM activation are important in sustaining the stemness of patient-derived glioma cells. In human tumor tissues, elevated levels of activated ATM correlate with poor patient survival. Self-inflicted DNA DSBs therefore are functionally important for maintaining the malignancy of cancer cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201741"
"cr","Baf60b-mediated ATM-p53 activation blocks cell identity conversion by sensing chromatin opening","Lineage conversion by expression of lineage-specific transcription factors is a process of epigenetic remodeling that has low efficiency. The mechanism by which a cell resists lineage conversion is largely unknown. Using hepatic-specific transcription factors Foxa3, Hnf1α and Gata4 (3TF) to induce hepatic conversion in mouse fibroblasts, we showed that 3TF induced strong activation of the ATM-p53 pathway, which led to proliferation arrest and cell death, and it further prevented hepatic conversion. Notably, ATM activation, independent of DNA damage, responded to chromatin opening during hepatic conversion. By characterizing the early molecular events during hepatic conversion, we found that Baf60b, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, links chromatin opening to ATM activation by facilitating ATM recruitment to the open chromatin regions of a panel of hepatic gene loci. These findings shed light on cellular responses to lineage conversion by revealing a function of the ATM-p53 pathway in sensing chromatin opening.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201736"
"cr","Blocking the recruitment of naive CD4+ T cells reverses immunosuppression in breast cancer","The origin of tumor-infiltrating Tregs, critical mediators of tumor immunosuppression, is unclear. Here, we show that tumor-infiltrating naive CD4+ T cells and Tregs in human breast cancer have overlapping TCR repertoires, while hardly overlap with circulating Tregs, suggesting that intratumoral Tregs mainly develop from naive T cells in situ rather than from recruited Tregs. Furthermore, the abundance of naive CD4+ T cells and Tregs is closely correlated, both indicating poor prognosis for breast cancer patients. Naive CD4+ T cells adhere to tumor slices in proportion to the abundance of CCL18-producing macrophages. Moreover, adoptively transferred human naive CD4+ T cells infiltrate human breast cancer orthotopic xenografts in a CCL18-dependent manner. In human breast cancer xenografts in humanized mice, blocking the recruitment of naive CD4+ T cells into tumor by knocking down the expression of PITPNM3, a CCL18 receptor, significantly reduces intratumoral Tregs and inhibits tumor progression. These findings suggest that breast tumor-infiltrating Tregs arise from chemotaxis of circulating naive CD4+ T cells that differentiate into Tregs in situ. Inhibiting naive CD4+ T cell recruitment into tumors by interfering with PITPNM3 recognition of CCL18 may be an attractive strategy for anticancer immunotherapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201734"
"cr","Extensive translation of circular RNAs driven by N6-methyladenosine","Extensive pre-mRNA back-splicing generates numerous circular RNAs (circRNAs) in human transcriptome. However, the biological functions of these circRNAs remain largely unclear. Here we report that N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant base modification of RNA, promotes efficient initiation of protein translation from circRNAs in human cells. We discover that consensus m6A motifs are enriched in circRNAs and a single m6A site is sufficient to drive translation initiation. This m6A-driven translation requires initiation factor eIF4G2 and m6A reader YTHDF3, and is enhanced by methyltransferase METTL3/14, inhibited by demethylase FTO, and upregulated upon heat shock. Further analyses through polysome profiling, computational prediction and mass spectrometry reveal that m6A-driven translation of circRNAs is widespread, with hundreds of endogenous circRNAs having translation potential. Our study expands the coding landscape of human transcriptome, and suggests a role of circRNA-derived proteins in cellular responses to environmental stress.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201731"
"cr","Efficient generation of mice carrying homozygous double-floxp alleles using the Cas9-Avidin/Biotin-donor DNA system","The clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system is a versatile tool for genomic engineering in mammalian cells and organisms, enabling the introduction of site-specific genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs)1. The resulting DSBs are repaired by at least two distinct and competitive mechanisms, nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). The former results in insertions and deletions (indels), whereas the latter leads to precise genetic modification.Precise genetic modification is of great utility in both research and clinical applications, even though the frequency of HDR is inherently low2,3. Several strategies have recently been developed to enhance the efficiency of HDR, including genetic or chemical interruption of the NHEJ pathway4,5, overexpression of a positive HDR regulator6 and manipulation of the cell cycle7. For example, Scr7, a DNA ligase IV inhibitor, has been shown to enhance HDR efficiency up to 2-4-fold in CRISPR/Cas9-manipulated embryos4. However, interference with endogenous genes has potentially detrimental side effects. Furthermore, such strategies are best suited to the knock-in of a short DNA fragment, normally no larger than 30 bp (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). The precise knock-in of a larger DNA fragment, such as one as large as 1 000 bp, is still a challenging task in mice8. Even for a donor DNA with ∼1-8 kb homology arms, the knock-in efficiency achieved by CRISPR/Cas9 was lower than 6% in mice9,10,11,12.The Cas9 protein preferentially remains at the targeting site, where it first releases the non-target strand and could anchor there for as long as 6 h13. We hypothesized that the donor DNA searching for a homologous sequence across the entire genome is a key rate-limiting step of HDR, and thus the donor DNA would have a greater chance of being used if it is associated with CRISPR/Cas9 components. Here we demonstrate a simple and robust method of enhancing the HDR efficiency with no side effects detected. The newly developed system, termed the Cas9-Avidin-Biotin ssDNA (CAB) system, achieved an HDR frequency of ∼20% in mouse embryos for insertions of ∼1 kb.The CAB system is composed of a Cas9 fused with avidin via a flexible linker, an sgRNA and a biotin-modified single-strand donor DNA (biotin-ssDNA) (Figure 1A). Due to the high affinity between avidin and biotin, biotin-ssDNA would be enriched at the cleavage site, a hypothesis which was supported by the membrane labeling experiment (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). First, we optimized the CAB system, and found that Cas9 fused at its C-terminus to avidin still retains activity similar to wild-type Cas9 and the linker length should be of at least 16 amino acids (Supplementary information, Figure S1C). These results suggest that an intact Cas9 N-terminus is essential for nuclease activity, which is consistent with a previous structural analysis of Cas914. Next, we assessed the performance of the optimized CAB system in 293T cells. The reporter assay showed a 2-fold enhancement of HDR efficiency, whereas sequencing analysis of editing at an endogenous gene locus revealed an elevation of the precise editing frequency by ∼5-fold (Supplementary information, Figure S1D-S1F). The CAB system also increased the ratio of the precise knock-in of a short DNA fragment up to 3-fold compared with the traditional CRISPR/Cas9 system in mouse zygotes (Supplementary information, Figure S2A-S2C).Figure 1The CAB system enables precise insertion of double floxp sites with high efficiency. (A) Schematic diagram showing the CAB system. Above: a single-strand donor DNA is modified by biotin at the 5′-terminus and it contains an insertion sequence (blue line) flanked by homology arms. Guided by sgRNA, the Cas9-avidin fusion protein induces DSB at the desired locus and enriches the donor DNA. Bottom: strategy for inducing the double-floxp insertion in a targeted gene locus. A single-strand DNA donor contains two floxp sites, each with a homology arm of ∼100 nt at one side. Genome amplification primers (red arrows) are located outside the donor region. Two sets of loxp detection primers are located near the upstream/downstream floxp sites, respectively. Once a floxp site is successfully inserted, a larger band appears above the wild-type band, termed the knock-in band.

Genomic DNA was extracted from the tail of F0 pups and amplified by PCR using the detection primer sets to identify the loxp insertion.

Thus, we investigated whether the CAB system can achieve the knock-in of double floxp sites in one step. The CAB or CRISPR/Cas9 components were microinjected into a fertilized mouse zygote. The manipulated embryos were cultured to the two-cell stage and transferred into pseudopregnant females. The tails of the pups carried to term were harvested for PCR and sequencing analyses.PRKACA, the gene for the catalytic subunit α of protein kinase A, has been linked to Cushing's syndrome, adrenocortical tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma and other diseases due to mutation or abnormal fusion. We sought to generate mice carrying two floxp sites inserted in the fifth and eighth introns of PRKACA, respectively (Supplementary information, Figure S2D). Two cleavage sites were selected according to the cutting efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and a ∼1 000-nt donor DNA flanked by 100-nt homology arms was synthesized.50% of the embryos manipulated by the CAB system generated live pups, demonstrating a survival rate comparable to that yielded by the CRISPR/Cas9 system (Figure 1B). At 7 days of age, DNA extracted from the pup tails was analyzed by PCR using two detection primer sets and sequencing using amplification primers. No precise editing was observed for the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and 36% of mice (4 out of 11) exhibited indels, indicating that DSBs were repaired via NHEJ (Figure 1B). In the CAB group, ∼15% pups (2 out of 14, i.e., No. 1 and No. 5) exhibited precise knock-in, which was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Figure 1B and Supplementary information, Figure S2E). The percentages of the precise knock-in alleles in the No. 1 and No. 5 mice were approximately 25% and 2%, respectively (Figure 1D). To demonstrate the successful germline transmission, the No. 1 founder mouse was crossed with a wild-type mouse, and five of six offspring were shown to carry the knock-in allele (Figure 1C and Supplementary information, Figure S2F).To further demonstrate the robustness of the CAB system, we generated three additional mouse genetic models carrying double floxp sites at UQCC3, ARF6 or Sirt7 gene (Figure 1B and Supplementary information, Figure S2D). Genotyping performed 7 days after the pup birth showed that 18%-22% of the F0 mice carried the knock-in alleles (Figure 1B), suggesting that the improvement in precise editing obtained using the CAB system is not limited to a particular locus. It is noteworthy that a large proportion of the positive F0 pups exhibited a ratio of over 50% for the precise knock-in allele (Figure 1D and Supplementary information, Figure S2G-S2I). Particularly in case of the ARF6 locus, the No. 13 F0 pup is likely homozygous for the knock-in allele as PCR analysis only revealed the knock-in band (Figure 1D and Supplementary information, Figure S2G) and all 14 TA clones sequenced were positive for double floxp sites (data not shown).Finally, we selected one F0 founder from each genetic type and crossed them with wild-type mice for germline transmission analysis. All four F0 founder mice produced F1 pups carrying the knock-in allele. Of note, 60%-100% of the F1 pups of each genotype harbored the knock-in allele (Figure 1E), suggesting that a large proportion of germ cells of the four F0 founders carried the knock-in allele. Thus, it is likely feasible to generate a heterozygous conditional knockout mouse within 6 months after obtaining the F0 founders by crossing the F0 mice harboring high levels of knock-in mosaicism with a Cre mouse.Here we report a simple and robust system to enhance HDR-mediated precise genomic editing in mouse embryos via the enrichment of donor DNA at the cleavage sites. Over 5 000 genetic diseases exist in humans; however, less than 10% have been mechanistically characterized and no gene editing therapy has been approved by FDA for clinical use. CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful tool for gene modification in a variety of organisms as well as human cells1. A large number of challenging issues need to be addressed before this powerful technology can come into clinical use, including the low efficiency of gene correction based on HDR. Using the CAB system, we have improved the HDR efficiency such that HDR-based precise editing occurred in ∼20% of the manipulated embryos.In summary, this system has three advantages. First, the donor DNA requires only two short homology arms of < 100 nt and thus can be easily synthesized. This is in contrast with traditional CRISPR/Cas9-mediated precise editing which requires long homology arms of a few kbs9,10,11,12. Second, this system does not cause additional toxicity compared with the CRISPR/Cas9 system, as evidenced by a similar survival rate of the F0 pups in embryos manipulated by these two systems. Safety is a critical concern for any CRISPR system in terms of future clinical application. Although chemical or genetic interruption of the NHEJ pathway can favor HDR, such manipulation may have a detrimental effect on embryonic development. It has been reported that Scr7 treatment results in defects in lymphocyte development15. Finally, we observed that 60%-100% of the F1 pups carried the knock-in allele with double floxp sites, suggesting that the new system would enhance the efficiency of generating a mouse model with precise genetic modification and thus save time compared with conventional approaches.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201729"
"cr","De novo DNA methylation during monkey pre-implantation embryogenesis","Critical epigenetic regulation of primate embryogenesis entails DNA methylome changes. Here we report genome-wide composition, patterning, and stage-specific dynamics of DNA methylation in pre-implantation rhesus monkey embryos as well as male and female gametes studied using an optimized tagmentation-based whole-genome bisulfite sequencing method. We show that upon fertilization, both paternal and maternal genomes undergo active DNA demethylation, and genome-wide de novo DNA methylation is also initiated in the same period. By the 8-cell stage, remethylation becomes more pronounced than demethylation, resulting in an increase in global DNA methylation. Promoters of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation are preferentially remethylated at the 8-cell stage, suggesting that this mode of energy metabolism may not be favored. Unlike in rodents, X chromosome inactivation is not observed during monkey pre-implantation development. Our study provides the first comprehensive illustration of the 'wax and wane' phases of DNA methylation dynamics. Most importantly, our DNA methyltransferase loss-of-function analysis indicates that DNA methylation influences early monkey embryogenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201725"
"cr","Visualization of aging-associated chromatin alterations with an engineered TALE system","Visualization of specific genomic loci in live cells is a prerequisite for the investigation of dynamic changes in chromatin architecture during diverse biological processes, such as cellular aging. However, current precision genomic imaging methods are hampered by the lack of fluorescent probes with high specificity and signal-to-noise contrast. We find that conventional transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) tend to form protein aggregates, thereby compromising their performance in imaging applications. Through screening, we found that fusing thioredoxin with TALEs prevented aggregate formation, unlocking the full power of TALE-based genomic imaging. Using thioredoxin-fused TALEs (TTALEs), we achieved high-quality imaging at various genomic loci and observed aging-associated (epi) genomic alterations at telomeres and centromeres in human and mouse premature aging models. Importantly, we identified attrition of ribosomal DNA repeats as a molecular marker for human aging. Our study establishes a simple and robust imaging method for precisely monitoring chromatin dynamics in vitro and in vivo.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201718"
"cr","Simultaneous enhancement of cellular and humoral immunity by the high salt formulation of Al(OH)3 adjuvant","Adjuvants play essential roles in vaccination by enhancing and/or shaping antigen-specific immune responses1. They are commonly used in every type of vaccines, e.g., cancer vaccines, which have been proved to be a promising approach for cancer immune therapy2. Aluminum-based adjuvants have been widely used in human vaccination for decades3. Despite the robust induction of antibody-mediated immune responses, a limitation of aluminum-based adjuvants is their weak stimulation of cell-mediated immunity4. Thus, the development of safe, stable and effective adjuvants with the ability to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses during clinical vaccination remains challenging. As the major antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to initiate immune responses, dendritic cells (DCs) can be triggered by environmental stimulation to elicit different phenotypes and functions5,6. Moreover, cross-presentation of extracellular protein antigens by DCs contributes to the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses7. Sodium chloride (NaCl) is closely related to our daily lives and has recently been found to have potential effects on the development of autoimmune diseases8,9 and specific states of macrophages10. However, the impacts of high concentrations of salt on the functions of DCs and the immune system have not been studied. The use of high salt formulation in combination with aluminum adjuvants in protein vaccines remains to be explored.Here we developed a new formulation of aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) adjuvant with a high salt concentration and utilized the OVA model antigen and the HBsAg antigen to evaluate its adjuvant effect. The serum ELISA results showed that the increase of the total IgG level reached a peak at 3.6% NaCl (Figure 1A). Compared with the adjuvant prepared in regular NaCl concentration (0.9%), the high-salt formulation of Al(OH)3 mildly improved OVA-induced production of IgG1-associated Th2 responses rather than IgG2a- and IgG2b-associated Th1 responses (Figure 1A). Similar results were also observed in the HBsAg model (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). These data suggest that the high-salt formulation of Al(OH)3 enhances humoral immunity by stimulating the Th2 response.Figure 1Simultaneous enhancement of cellular and humoral immunity by the high-salt formulation of Al(OH)3 adjuvant. (A) High salt concentration enhances Al(OH)3 adjuvant-induced humoral immunity. C57BL/6 mice (n = 5 per group) were vaccinated subcutaneously three times with OVA/Al complex containing different concentrations of NaCl (5 μg OVA per mouse). Seven days after the third immunization, the mouse serum was collected and levels of the total IgG and IgG subclasses and IgG1 titer were determined by ELISA. (B-E) OVA/Al/high salt vaccine induces specific cellular immunity. C57BL/6 mice were immunized in the same way as described in A. Lymphocytes were isolated from the spleen and further incubated in vitro with CD8+-specific OVA257–264 peptides (10 μg/ml) for 3 days. The generation of CD8+ CTLs was determined by FCM using PE-conjugated H-2Kb/OVA257–264tetramer (B). The expression of IFN-γ was examined by FCM (C) and ELISA (D). The same lymphocytes were tested for CTL-mediated cytotoxicity against E.G7-OVA cells by a standard 6 h 51Cr release assay (E). (F) High concentrations of NaCl promote the maturation of DCs in vitro. Bone marrow-derived DCs isolated from C57BL/6 mice were cultured in medium with the indicated NaCl concentrations for 48 h and the expression of maturation markers was analyzed by FCM. (G) High concentrations of NaCl promote the antigen uptake of DCs in vitro. DCs were incubated with 2 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-labeled OVA for 1 h at 37 °C in medium with the indicated NaCl concentrations and analyzed under a fluorescent microscope. Scale bars, 20 μm. (H) High concentration of NaCl promotes secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines by DCs through the p38 MAPK pathway in vitro. DCs were pretreated with 10 μM SB203580 (SB) or DMSO (DM) for 2 h and then treated with 0.9% or 1.5% NaCl for 48 h in the presence of 5 μM SB or DM. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the supernatant were measured by ELISA. (I-J) High salt concentration induces antigen cross-presentation in DCs. DCs were cultured in medium with the indicated NaCl concentrations containing 10 μg/ml OVA. Then the stimulated DCs were co-cultured with CFSE-labeled CD8+ T cells from OT-I mice. The proliferation of T cells was assessed by FCM after 3 days of co-culture (I). DCs were treated with 2 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-labeled OVA in the presence of the indicated NaCl concentrations for 1 h, stained with rabbit anti-LMP2/Cy3 antibody and DAPI, and visualized under a confocal laser scanning microscope. Scale bars, 5 μm (J). (K) High-salt formulation potentiates the antitumor effect of OVA/Al vaccine in vivo. In a prophylactic model (left), C57BL/6 mice (n = 10 per group) were immunized with different vaccines for three times and then challenged subcutaneously with 3 × 106 E.G7-OVA cells 1 week after the third immunization. In a therapeutic model (right), mice (n = 7 per group) were treated by subcutaneous injection of different vaccines once a week for 3 weeks starting on day 3 after subcutaneously introduction of 3 × 106 E.G7-OVA cells. The tumor volume was measured every 3 days. (L) The high-salt formulation of OVA/Al diminished immune suppressive cells in tumor microenvironment. After the third treatment, a single-cell suspension of tumor tissues was prepared. The percentages of infiltrating CD8+ lymphocytes, MDSCs and M2 macrophages were analyzed by FCM.Full size imageNext, we assessed whether the new formulation can enhance the induction of cell-mediated immunity. We found that vaccination of mice with OVA/Al/3.6% NaCl dramatically increased the frequency of OVA-specific CD8+ T cells as detected by PE-conjugated OVA257–264-bound H-2kb tetramer compared with vaccination with OVA/Al (Figure 1B). In addition, vaccination with OVA/Al/3.6% NaCl not only dramatically increased the frequency of CD8+ INF-γ-producing CTLs, but also increased the secretion of INF-γ (Figure 1C and 1D). Similar results were also obtained in the HBsAg vaccine model (Supplementary information, Figure S1B and S1C). Moreover, T lymphocytes derived from the mice immunized with OVA/Al/3.6% NaCl exhibited higher cytotoxicity against E.G7-OVA cells (a cell line expressing OVA peptides) as revealed by a standard 51Cr-release assay (Figure 1E). Notably, there was no significant increase in the percentages of CD4+ INF-γ-producing Th1 cells after high salt treatment in either the OVA or HBsAg vaccine model (Supplementary information, Figure S1D), indicating that high salt helped to enhance the induction of antigen-specific CTLs, bypassing the CD4+ T helper arm. Also, there was no increase of the IL-4 level after immunization with OVA/Al/3.6% NaCl compared with the OVA/Al group (Supplementary information, Figure S1E).We next examined whether and how high salt influences the activation of DCs. Since a NaCl concentration of 1.8% caused increased apoptosis and cell death of DCs (Supplementary information, Figure S1J), our subsequent in vitro experiments mainly focused on the concentrations of 1.2% and 1.5%. Interestingly, high salt significantly promoted maturation and antigen uptake ability of DCs in vitro (Figure 1F and 1G and Supplementary information, Figure S1F). Moreover, high salt promotes the expression of inflammatory cytokines in DCs at both mRNA and protein levels (Supplementary information, Figure S1G and S1H). As MAPK pathways were reported to have roles in cellular responses to stress stimulation11, we explored the possibility of the involvement of the MAPK signaling pathway in DC activation. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK significantly increased after hours of high salt treatment (Supplementary information, Figure S1I). Furthermore, the increased release of inflammatory cytokines could be abolished by the addition of a p38 inhibitor SB203580 (Figure 1H).Efficient cross-presentation of extracellular proteins by DCs has an important role in the initiation of immune responses7. Here, we used CD8+ T cells from OT-I mice (specific for the H-2Kb/OVA complex) to test whether high salt-stimulated DCs can perform cross-presentation of soluble OVA. The FCM analysis of CFSE fluorescence showed a 2-fold increase in CD8+ T-cell proliferation upon co-culture with high salt-treated DCs (Figure 1I). Also, more clusters of DCs and CD8+ T cells were observed and enhanced secretion of IL-2 was detected in the supernatants during the co-culture process (Supplementary information, Figure S1K and S1L). Moreover, confocal microscopy revealed that more OVA co-localized with LMP2 (a marker of the immunoproteasome) in high salt-treated DCs, suggesting a more effective processing of antigens (Figure 1J). Collectively, the above data indicate that high salt can significantly enhance cross-presentation of extracellular antigens by DCs, which might play a critical role in the induction of antigen-specific CTL activity.Next, we examined the in vivo antitumor effect of the OVA/Al/high salt vaccine using the E.G7-OVA tumor model in mice. In either the prophylactic or therapeutic vaccine model, immunization of the OVA/Al/high salt complex inhibited tumor growth more effectively compared with the other groups (Figure 1K). The antitumor effect of the OVA/Al/3.6% NaCl vaccine was further studied in an adoptive cellular/serum therapy model. Lymphocytes from mice immunized with OVA/Al/3.6% NaCl effectively inhibited tumor growth, while the serum showed no apparent antitumor effect (Supplementary information, Figure S1M and S1N). To investigate the function of immune cell subsets in the antitumor activity elicited by the high salt formulation, we depleted CD4+/CD8+ T cells or NK cells through the injection of monoclonal antibodies. Only depletion of CD8+ T lymphocytes and NK cells showed effective abrogation of the antitumor effect induced by the OVA/Al/3.6% NaCl vaccine (Supplementary information, Figure S1O). Taken together, these results suggest that a high-salt formulation of OVA/Al vaccine exhibited an enhanced antitumor effect in vivo through CD8+ CTL-mediated cellular immunity independent of CD4+ T cells.To further study the role of high-salt formulation in the strong antitumor effect, we assessed the changes in immune cell subsets after the immunization. Both central memory and effector memory T cells in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations significantly increased in the OVA/Al/high salt group (Supplementary information, Figure S1P). We also observed an increase in percentages of splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the OVA/Al/high salt group (Supplementary information, Figure S1P). As an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment might be a major determinant of the poor outcome of tumor immunotherapy12, we further investigated whether the high-salt vaccine alters the immune microenvironment in tumors. We found that tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes increased, whereas myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and M2 macrophages decreased significantly in OVA/Al/3.6% NaCl-treated mice (Figure 1L). These observations indicate that high salt-containing vaccine may alter the tumor microenvironment to favor more potent antitumor effects.For safety assessment, no significant differences were observed between normal mice and the mice immunized with aluminum and high salt, as determined by appearance, body weight, fecal and urinary excretion, and H&E staining of the vital organs. All the mice were under good physiological conditions as shown by the monitoring of heart rate and mean arterial pressure, even when the NaCl concentration reached as high as 14.4% (16 times higher than the normal osmolality; Supplementary information, Table S1).In conclusion, we discovered a novel and safe formulation (high salt formulation) of Al(OH)3 adjuvant, which, aside from maintaining the induction of humoral immune response by normal Al-adjuvant, could further enhance the cellular immune response; and this effect may be closely related to the activation of and antigen cross-presentation by DCs. Consequently, the OVA/Al/high salt formulation exhibited a significant antitumor effect against the E.G7-OVA tumor model in vivo, which might be largely due to CD8+ CTL-mediated cellular immunity and independent of CD4+ T cells. The most interesting and surprising finding of this study is that the adjuvant effects could be significantly improved simply by altering the NaCl concentration in vaccines and such formulation is safe, easy to prepare, and of low cost. This concept may assist in the design of broad vaccine formulations and the development of safer and more effective adjuvants for therapeutic uses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201714"
"cr","Painting a specific chromosome with CRISPR/Cas9 for live-cell imaging","Visualization of chromosome shapes and dynamics in a live cell is highly desirable and necessary in many areas of cell biology. For example, the copy number of a particular chromosome in cancer cells is often abnormal (e.g., more than two), and therefore probing chromosome copy numbers can aid cancer diagnosis. During interphase, each chromosome exists in its own territory in the nucleus, which can be imaged by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using sequence-specific probes of different colors1,2. However, such chromosome painting has only been possible in fixed cells, and is not suitable for dynamic monitoring of live cells. Therefore, it would be valuable to visualize DNA replication of one chromosome during interphase, and follow chromosome dynamics in the M phase.Recent development of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR/Cas)3 has provided a powerful tool for live-cell imaging of genomic loci4. In particular, the nuclease defective Cas9 (dCas9) fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) is used to target a particular DNA sequence upstream of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence. Such targeting is achieved through Watson-Crick base pairing of ∼20-bp single-guide RNA (sgRNA) that is pre-complexed with the dCas9-EGFP protein. The targeted loci can thus be fluorescently labeled in live mammalian cells5,6,7,8. However, the labeling achieved by this method is usually restricted to the genomic loci that consist of repetitive sequences, and has not been attempted to track an entire chromosome in a live cell.Here we report the specific labeling of a large number of loci in the genome, which makes it possible to paint an entire chromosome in a live cell. To do so, we designed a new strategy using a large number of sgRNAs targeting mainly the non-repetitive regions of the chromosome (Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Figure S1A). To design sgRNAs, we scanned the sequence of the entire chromosome 9 on human reference genome hg19. Each 19-23 bp genome sequence upstream of a PAM sequence NGG was taken as a candidate target region. Because the efficiency of sgRNA binding is dependent on its GC content9,10, sgRNAs with GC content of 45%-65% were selected (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). The sgRNAs that could also bind to other chromosomes were removed in order to assure labeling specificity and reduce fluorescent background. Additionally, when multiple targeting sequences overlapped in a chromosome region, only one of them was selected. Among all sgRNAs, only one protein-coding gene (DNAJB5) contains sgRNA-binding sites in the exon region (Supplementary information, Figure S1C), but its expression level was not affected by lentivirus infection or dCas9-EGFP/sgRNA targeting (Supplementary information, Figure S1D).Figure 1Construction of the CRISPR/Cas9 imaging system for fluorescent labeling of a particular chromosome in live cells. (A) Scatter plot for numbers of sgRNA-binding sites in each cluster of 5 Kb width across human chromosome 9. In the model of sgRNA-binding sites on the entire chromosome 9, vertical lines labeled as c1-c15 indicate the locations of 15 sgRNA clusters' binding sites. (B) Maximum intensity projection of EGFP images recorded by N-SIM at the S phase of the cell cycle. Step size, 0.12 μm; Scale bar, 5 μm. Three copies of chromosome 9 in a HeLa cell are clearly visible. (C) Maximum intensity projection of EGFP images recorded by N-SIM in the prophase of mitosis. Step size, 0.12 μm; Scale bar, 5 μm. Two sister chromatids of each chromosome 9 are clearly resolved. (D) EGFP image (green) in live cells at different stages of the M phase, recorded by an Olympus inverted wide-field fluorescence microscope. Three pairs of the chromosome 9 in the prophase and metaphase, whose two sister chromatids are not clearly resolved due to the reduced resolution, separate in the anaphase and telophase. Cells are also stained with Hoechst (blue) for DNA. All step size, 0.2 μm; depth of maximum intensity projection for prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase, 4 μm, 7 μm, 8 μm and 6 μm, respectively; scale bar, 5 μm. (E) Co-localization of chromosome 9 labeled by dCas9-EGFP (green) and C9-1 and C9-2 loci labeled by Cy3-tagged FISH probes (red). Scale bar, 5 μm. (F) Dynamics of the three copies of chromosome 9 in S phase in a live HeLa cell. Z maximum intensity projection of 10.5 μm. Scale bar, 5 μm. See also Supplementary information, Movie S1. (G) Distribution of sgRNA sequences from a single clonal sample detected by DNA sequencing after PCR amplification using the common primers for the sgRNA sequences. Single clone 1 (S1) was selected from a cell pool that has been painted with 802 sgRNAs. Majority of the sgRNA sequences have been incorporated into a cell single clone. The horizontal dashed line indicates the level with 20 sgRNA sequences per cluster, which is necessary for effective chromosome painting. (H) Distribution of numbers of reads for different sgRNA sequences, showing efficient incorporation and even distribution of the pooled 802 sgRNA library in the cell population.Full size imageTo obtain high densities of sgRNA that would give signals significantly above the intracellular fluorescent background, especially when the chromatin is in open state during G and S phases, we chose 15 clusters of target sites (c1-c15) on chromosome 9, each spanning 5 Kb and containing more than 30 targets. The clusters are placed at least 5 Mbp away from each other (Figure 1A). In total, we selected 1 124 sgRNAs that are distributed on chromosome 9 (Supplementary information, Table S1).As shown in Supplementary information, Figure S1A, a cell line stably expressing dCas9-EGFP was constructed from one HeLa cell by lentiviral infection. In the meantime, the 1 124 sgRNAs were packaged into lentiviruses and used to infect HeLa cells expressing dCas9-EGFP for three times. After labeling the chromosome with the 1 124 sgRNAs, we imaged cells in the S phase using a Nikon structured illumination microscope (N-SIM) equipped with a 100× TIRF oil immersion objective (NA 1.49). Figure 1B shows that the projected z-stack EGFP images. We attribute the three bright EGFP signal regions in the nucleus to three copies of chromosome 9, which is consistent with the karyotype of the HeLa cells we used (Supplementary information, Figure S1E). We noted that the EGFP signal is stronger in the S phase, when DNA replication takes place, than in the G1 phase, indicating that dCas9-EGFP can bind rapidly to newly synthesized DNA. Taken together, the imaging results suggest the efficacy of our method in visualizing a desired chromosomal territory in a live cell.Figure 1C shows a projected z-stack of N-SIM fluorescence images taken in the prophase during mitosis. The high resolution of structured illumination microscopy and the strong signal due to chromosome condensation, allowed for the visualization of the three pairs of sister chromatids (Figure 1C) after DNA replication.We next aimed to verify the dCas9-EGFP signals with FISH using probes targeting repetitive sequences so that a single FISH probe could access many sites. We used another two sgRNA sequences, C9-1 and C9-2, which were previously described and named7, to replace the three non-repetitive clusters c13-c15. C9-1 binds to a region with pericentromeric repeats on chromosome 9 and C9-2 targets 115 sites within a 5 Kb region.We delivered 800 sgRNAs from c1-c12 clusters as well as C9-1 and C9-2 (802 sgRNAs in total) into the HeLa cells expressing dCas9-EGFP by lentivirus infection (Supplementary information, Figure S2A). Before painting the entire chromosome, we confirmed that each of the 12 clusters of sgRNAs could individually label the corresponding genomic locus efficiently (Supplementary information, Figure S2B). As expected, we observed the co-localization of dCas9-EGFP and FISH labeling of C9-1 and C9-2 (Supplementary information, Figure S2C).After labeling the chromosome with the 802 sgRNAs, we found the imaging results for the chromosome territory and three pairs of sister chromatids are very similar to those labeled with c1-c15 containing 1 124 sgRNAs (Supplementary information, Figure S2D and E). The labeled chromosome 9 in the M phase can be easily seen even with a wide-field fluorescence microscopy. Figure 1D shows the cells in the prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase during mitosis. The cells were also stained with a DNA-specific dye Hoechst 33342, which allows co-localization of chromosome 9 with the rest of chromosomes. The three pairs of sister chromatids in the prophase and metaphase, though not clearly resolved with this reduced resolution, split to two sets of separate chromosomes in the anaphase and telophase. As a final control experiment, Figure 1E shows co-localization of labeled chromosome 9 of the EGFP signal with the Cy3-tagged C9-1 and C9-2 FISH probes. The fact that the EGFP areas were larger than the diffraction-limited FISH areas proves again the successful labeling of chromosome 9.Having demonstrated stable labeling of chromosome 9, we next applied our method to dynamic monitoring using a DeltaVision Imaging System (Applied Precision/GE) equipped with a 100×/1.4 NA oil immersion objective, which allows less photobleaching, longer time for data acquisition, and confocality based on deconvolution. Figure 1F and Supplementary information, Movie S1 show chromosome dynamics at a single chromosome level for a cell in the S phase. Supplementary information, Figure S2F and Movie S2 show the dynamics of chromosome 9 during a period of 2 h from the late S phase to M phase. In addition to the three chromosome 9 spots, the nucleoli exhibit unintended EGFP signal, likely due to nonspecific binding of dCas9-EGFP protein with small RNAs in the nucleoli8. During the data collection period, EGFP signal from the nucleoli faded away due to the disappearance of the nucleoli in the M phase, while chromosome 9 fluorescent signal became stronger due to chromosome condensation. Supplementary information, Movie S3 shows another cell in the M phase for a period of ∼3 h. After cell division, the two daughter cells maintained strong fluorescence signals from the replicated chromosomes, indicating that chromosome labeling is kept in the daughter cells. In this movie, significant conformational fluctuation of the condensed chromosomes was observed. Although hundreds of sgRNAs were delivered by lentivirus into the cells, no obvious effects on cell proliferation were observed (Supplementary information, Figure S2G).To evaluate how many sgRNAs were actually introduced to each cell, we carried out DNA sequencing of clonally amplified cells after PCR amplification with the common primers for sgRNA sequences11. Figure 1G shows the distribution of the detected 510 non-repetitive sgRNA sequences in chromosome 9 in one clonally amplified population. Single clones with higher labeling efficiency (S1) had more sgRNAs sequences incorporated than single clones with weaker fluorescence (S34) (Supplementary information, Figure S2H). Figure 1H shows the distribution of read numbers for all sgRNA sequences in the population of cells, showing that majority of the sgRNAs has been sufficiently incorporated into the cell population.To address the question of how many sgRNAs are sufficient for painting a chromosome, we reduced the number of non-repetitive sgRNAs to 485. We found no significant deterioration of the image quality when compared with the images produced with 802 sgRNAs (Supplementary information, Figure S2I), when we imaged chromosome 9 at different phases of the M phase. Based on this, we conclude that more than 20 sgRNAs in each cluster and at least 300 types of total sgRNAs are needed in one cell for effective chromosome 9 painting. As the required number of the sgRNAs should be dependent on the length of the chromosome, we anticipate that using our design strategy ∼800 sgRNAs should be enough to label the longest human chromosome 1, which is about twice as long as chromosome 9, while ∼100 sgRNAs could be enough for the shortest chromosome. Of course, for painting other chromosomes, additional optimization and validation may be required.In summary, by introducing hundreds of specific and non-repetitive sgRNAs in a human cell, we are able to paint an entire chromosome in a live cell for fluorescent imaging. We have visualized the spatial arrangements of homologous chromosomes and sister chromatids and tracked the movement of a particular chromosome in dividing cells. Our method will facilitate studies of functional organization of chromosomes, interactions among different chromosome regions, and long-term chromosomal dynamics in live mammalian cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20179"
"cr","Macrophagic CD146 promotes foam cell formation and retention during atherosclerosis","The persistence of cholesterol-engorged macrophages (foam cells) in the artery wall fuels the development of atherosclerosis. However, the mechanism that regulates the formation of macrophage foam cells and impedes their emigration out of inflamed plaques is still elusive. Here, we report that adhesion receptor CD146 controls the formation of macrophage foam cells and their retention within the plaque during atherosclerosis exacerbation. CD146 is expressed on the macrophages in human and mouse atheroma and can be upregulated by oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). CD146 triggers macrophage activation by driving the internalization of scavenger receptor CD36 during lipid uptake. In response to oxLDL, macrophages show reduced migratory capacity toward chemokines CCL19 and CCL21; this capacity can be restored by blocking CD146. Genetic deletion of macrophagic CD146 or targeting of CD146 with an antibody result in much less complex plaques in high-fat diet-fed ApoE−/− mice by causing lipid-loaded macrophages to leave plaques. Collectively, our findings identify CD146 as a novel retention signal that traps macrophages within the artery wall, and a promising therapeutic target in atherosclerosis treatment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20178"
"cr","Live cell single molecule-guided Bayesian localization super resolution microscopy","Many current super resolution (SR) microscopic techniques1,2,3,4,5,6 have been successfully applied to image cellular dynamics in living cells, but their applications have remained technically challenging. Live cell stimulated emission depletion (STED)/reversible saturable optical linear fluorescence transitions (RESOLFT) microscopy and structured illumination microscopy (SIM)/nonlinear SIM require sophisticated expensive optical setups and specialized expertise for accurate optical alignment. Live cell photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM)/stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) use less complicated setup; however, a scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (sCMOS) camera, whose pixel-dependent noise must be characterized and calibrated before use7, is required for extremely high acquisition speed over tens of thousands of frames. Recently, wide field-based SR microscopies have been developed to improve temporal resolution using much fewer time-lapse images (hundreds to thousands) than PALM/STORM8,9. One of them, Bayesian analysis of the blinking and bleaching (3B)8, offers enormous potential to resolve ultrastructure and fast cellular dynamics in living cells beyond the diffraction limit. Despite its potential, 3B analysis is impractical when imaging the nanoscale dynamics in large fields of view over long time periods, as the calculation is extremely time-consuming8 and/or the analysis consumes large amounts of web resources10. Another major problem of 3B imaging is the artificial thinning and thickening of structures both in simulated image data and in experimental data8,10.In the present study we first developed a Quick-3B algorithm, which can calculate 17-fold faster than 3B; however, it still artificially produces discontinuous dot-shaped structures (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). We therefore developed SIMBA (single molecule-guided Bayesian localization microscopy) to further improve the fidelity of the method, as well as the computation speed and temporal resolution by combining single molecule localization and other algorithms (Supplementary information, Data S1 and Figure S2). SIMBA can produce an appropriate 50 nm SR image of actin in fixed cells, and calculate a series of whole cell live structures with a 0.5-2 s temporal resolution for 50 time points on a desktop computer.To validate that SIMBA can reconstruct an underlying SR structures, we labeled actin with lifeact-mEos3.2 in U2OS cells and performed correlative experiments. The actin network is highly dynamic and exhibits different subtype structures criss-crossing at various distances and angles, including stress fibers and bundles with different sizes and diameters6. To determine whether SIMBA can discriminate between these different structures, we compared the result of SIMBA analysis with that of 3B analysis and PALM imaging (Figure 1A-1C). A small area (15 × 30 pixels, 1 pixel = 160 nm) of actin ruffles (Figure 1A) was chosen for comparison because 3B analysis is impractical for calculating the entire field of view (Figure 1B1-6). Compared with 3B analysis, the actin ruffles produced by SIMBA analysis from 200 frames resembled more closely to the PALM data from 20 000 frames (Figure 1B4-6). Notably, the thin and discontinuous structures, artifacts seen in 3B analysis (Figure 1B2), were similar to what were previously reported8. These artifacts were absent in the images produced by SIMBA (Figure 1B3), Furthermore, unlike in 3B analysis, where the running time increases exponentially as the field of view (FOV) enlarges, the running time for different FOVs is nearly constant in SIMBA (Figure 1C1). Most strikingly, the larger the image areas are, the more advantage SIMBA has over the 3B analysis. For an area of 50 × 50 pixels, SIMBA's computing time was approximately 100 times shorter than that of the 3B analysis (Figure 1C2).Figure 1SIMBA imaging of actin network in a fixed U2OS cell and CCPs in a living HeLa cell.

(G) Time-lapse images at selective time points of region outlined by the yellow box in E. Scale bars are 2 μm (A), 1 μm (D, E), 500 nm (B1-5) and 200 nm (F, G).Full size imageEncouraged by the superior computing speed and localization accuracy within small areas, we reconstructed a whole cell SR image of actin structures by SIMBA analysis using only 200 raw frames and compared the result with that made by PALM using 20,000 frames. The whole cell SIMBA image shows various distinct actin structures, such as actin filaments, actin bundles, and ruffles, which are confirmed by PALM (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). An example is the ruffle structure resolved by the SIMBA analysis (Supplementary information, Figure S1B), which has very similar details as that resolved by PALM (Supplementary information, Figure S1B), with features separated by the same distances in both data sets (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). We determined the spatial resolution by measuring the distance at which two actin strands could be visually separated (Supplementary information, Figure S1B) and found that the SIMBA method achieved 49-nm resolution at an intersection of two strands (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). Also, by calculating the averaged half width at half maximum (FWHM) from a few thinnest filaments, we found the mean localization precision of SIMBA is 44 ± 5.6 nm (data not shown).We next performed SR imaging of actin-based structures and clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) over large FOV in live cells by the SIMBA analysis. Lifeact-mEos3.2 was used to label the actin network in U2OS cells. A series of time-lapse images with an 18-ms exposure and a 20-s interval were acquired and each 100 frames were used to reconstruct one SR image by the SIMBA analysis. An example of the reconstructed results from the experiment is shown in the Supplementary information, Movie S1. Compared with the whole cell wide field image (Supplementary information, Figure S1C), the reconstructed SIMBA SR image showed much higher resolution and contained many more details (Supplementary information, Figure S1C). Highly dynamic movements of the actin network and the formation of actin ring structures were observed (Supplementary information, Figure S1C). To further increase the temporary resolution of the SIMBA method, we increased the acquisition speed and found that actin structures could still be well resolved at a 5-ms exposure time (Supplementary information, Movie S2), thus achieving a minimum acquisition time of 0.5 s.Next we examined CCP formation in live Hela cells. As a control, the PALM images from 100 frames could not resolve the ring structures characteristic of CCPs due to low molecular density, neither could images from 5 000 frames that had much higher molecular density but reduced temporal resolution (Supplementary information, Figure S1D). On contrast, mature CCPs imaged at 37 °C can be successfully resolved as rings at one or more time points by the SIMBA method using the same 100 frames (Figure 1D-1G and Supplementary information, Movie S3). Both isolated rings and larger aggregates were observed, similar to the structures reported in COS-7 cells6. Most strikingly, CCPs resolved by SIMBA showed more complete and continuous structure than the previous live cell PALM result using high acquisition speed achieved by sCMOS7. Our time-lapse imaging showed that some mEos3.2-CCPs were dynamic, appearing and disappearing during the experiment (Figure 1F). More interestingly, we observed that in almost the same area, one CCP remained stationary for a long time, while other CCPs underwent dynamical reorganization — segregating into isolated rings and then associating with each other again (Figure 1G). These results suggest that CCPs are highly dynamic structures, assembling, disassembling, and interacting with each other.We next applied SIMBA to image structures inside the cells, the ER and mitochondria, and found SIMBA could image intracellular structures with very high spatial resolution (Supplementary information, Figure S1E).In summary, our study finds that Quick-3B analysis can greatly accelerate the computation speed of 3B. We next present a powerful live cell SR method, SIMBA, with several remarkable advantages. First, SIMBA is easy to use and is easy to combine with total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM), PALM, STORM and light-sheet microscopy without any additional hardware and expertise. Second, it can achieve a 50 nm spatial resolution as judged by the measurement of actin structures in the fixed cells. Third, it requires much less computational resource compared with 3B and can be done on a desktop computer. Fourth, it extends the 3B technology to SR imaging of whole cells with a 0.5-2 s temporal resolution over a long observation period with significantly fewer image artifacts.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016160"
"cr","Mitochondrial PKM2 regulates oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by stabilizing Bcl2","Pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) catalyzes the last step of glycolysis and plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation. Recent studies have reported that PKM2 also regulates apoptosis. However, the mechanisms underlying such a role of PKM2 remain elusive. Here we show that PKM2 translocates to mitochondria under oxidative stress. In the mitochondria, PKM2 interacts with and phosphorylates Bcl2 at threonine (T) 69. This phosphorylation prevents the binding of Cul3-based E3 ligase to Bcl2 and subsequent degradation of Bcl2. A chaperone protein, HSP90α1, is required for this function of PKM2. HSP90α1's ATPase activity launches a conformational change of PKM2 and facilitates interaction between PKM2 and Bcl2. Replacement of wild-type Bcl2 with phosphorylation-deficient Bcl2 T69A mutant sensitizes glioma cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and impairs brain tumor formation in an orthotopic xenograft model. Notably, a peptide that is composed of the amino acid residues from 389 to 405 of PKM2, through which PKM2 binds to Bcl2, disrupts PKM2-Bcl2 interaction, promotes Bcl2 degradation and impairs brain tumor growth. In addition, levels of Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation, conformation-altered PKM2 and Bcl2 protein correlate with one another in specimens of human glioblastoma patients. Moreover, levels of Bcl2 T69 phosphorylation and conformation-altered PKM2 correlate with both grades and prognosis of glioma malignancy. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism through which mitochondrial PKM2 phosphorylates Bcl2 and inhibits apoptosis directly, highlight the essential role of PKM2 in ROS adaptation of cancer cells, and implicate HSP90-PKM2-Bcl2 axis as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in glioblastoma.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016159"
"cr","Single-cell exome sequencing identifies mutations in KCP, LOC440040, and LOC440563 as drivers in renal cell carcinoma stem cells","Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for ∼3% of adult malignancies and 90%-95% of kidney neoplasms1. Metastatic disease is usually resistant to radiation and chemotherapy. Immunotherapy shows limited response rates of 15% to 20%2. Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) are key players in RCC initiation, development and resistance to therapy3. Previous studies have shown that RCC is a genetically distinct adult carcinoma with a relatively low mutation rate4. Sequencing analyses have revealed that some common somatic mutations are shared among RCC patients5. Recently, single-cell exome sequencing has been used to evaluate somatic mutations in many tumor types6. However, a systematic effort applying this new technique to identify key driver genes in the CSCs of RCC has not been made.CD133 has been identified as a common CSC marker for many solid tumors, including kidney cancer7. We investigated whether CD133+ RCC cells isolated from patients showed stem-like characteristics. We sorted CD133+ and CD133− RCC cells from the specimens of a 57-year-old male patient diagnosed with stage T3aN1M0 RCC (Supplementary information, Figure S1A and Supplementary information, Table S1A), and only CD133+ cells had sphere-forming capability (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). We next grafted isolated CD31−CD45−, CD31−CD45−CD133−, or CD31−CD45−CD133+ RCC cells subcutaneously into NOD/SCID mice. Nearly all mice that received 10 000 CD31−CD45−CD133+ cells developed visible tumors, and among mice that received only 10 cells, ∼25% developed visible tumors (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). However, more than 50% of the mice transplanted with the other two cell types (10 000 cells/mouse) remained tumor-free (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). In addition, to directly evaluate the frequency of stem-like RCC cells, we applied an extreme limiting dilution assay. We estimated the percentage of CSCs in the CD31−CD45−CD133+ cell sample was more than seven fold higher than in the other two cell types (Supplementary information, Figure S1C), indicating that CD133+cells isolated from RCC have stem-like properties.We next sorted 10 CD133+ RCC cells, 10 CD133− RCC cells, and 10 normal renal cells from the same patient for single-cell whole-exome sequencing (WES). The RCC and adjacent normal tissues of the same patient were also subjected to WES (Supplementary information, Figure S1D). For each cell and tissue sample, we acquired WES data with over 140× coverage after whole-genome amplification (WGA) using the MALBAC technique.To eliminate the false-positive variations arising from WGA, we only selected single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) present in CD133+ or CD133− RCC cells but absent in normal cells. Similarly, for whole-tissue WES analysis, SNVs specifically present in the RCC tissue were chosen. WES of the cancer tissue revealed 160 somatic SNVs and single-cell sequencing of the 20 tumor cells identified 297 somatic SNVs (Supplementary information, Figure S1E). Commonly mutated genes in RCC, such as VHL, BAP1, TRA and CHD4, were found to carry variations in both RCC single cells and tissue samples, demonstrating the reliability of our WES analysis (Supplementary information, Table S1B). Among the SNVs in single cells, 141 were located in coding regions. These SNVs were more enriched in CD133+ cells than in CD133− cells (Figure 1A and 1C). More importantly, we discovered several coding region mutations that are unique to CD133+ RCC cells. Among them, three missense mutations, c.A241T>p.R81W in Kielin/chordin-like protein (KCP), c.G316A>p.G106S in LOC440563 and c.A406T>p.N136Y in LOC440040, have not been reported in RCC. While other mutations in KCP can be found in the RCC TCGA database (c.G2590A>p.A864T, c.C1250G>p.A417G, and c.A2680G>p.R894G), no mutations in LOC440563 and LOC440040 have been linked to RCC and other cancer before (Figure 1A, Supplementary information, Table S1C). In addition, we found that KCP and LOC440040 mutations could be detected in both single cells and in the original cancer tissue (Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Table S1B). Furthermore, we identified that C/G>T/A, A/T>C/G and A/T>G/C transitions were the most common mutations in RCC (Figure 1B). Notably, the A/T>T/A transitions were significantly more frequent in CD133+ cells than in CD133− cells (Figure 1B, P = 0.31 × 10−9).Figure 1Identification of driver genes in renal cell carcinoma stem cells via single-cell exome sequencing.

(G) Data points indicate the average number of spheres of RCC cells with distinct mutations in serum-free conditions. Each of the 20 mutations was tested alone (first column, 'single mutation'), in combination with a KCP mutation (second column) or in combination with KCP and LOC440040 mutations (third column). Other mutations were also tested in combination with KCP, LOC440040, and LOC440563 mutations (fourth column). Mutation combinations that enhanced the in vitro spherogenicity (blue) were selected for in vivo validation. CD133+ cells spheres served as the positive control (red).

(K) The CD31−CD45−CD133+ cells from 57 RCC patients were individually sorted and pooled together for the indicated targeted sequencing. The mutation rates of KCP, LOC440040, and LOC440563 are indicated. (L) The average tumor-free time of 57 renal cancer patients with or without KCP, LOC440040, and/or LOC440563 mutation(s) after primary tumor resection.Full size imageTo further confirm that the isolated single cells are indeed tumor cells, we performed principle component analysis of all somatic mutation data obtained from the 30 cells (Figure 1D). The normal renal and CD133− RCC cells formed two independent groups, whereas the CD133+ RCC cells were scattered and were different from these two groups (Figure 1D). We constructed a neighbor-joining tree for the 30 cells; in the tree, the 10 normal cells were grouped together, whereas both sets of 10 CD133+ RCC cells and 10 CD133− RCC cells were nearly completely separated between the groups (Figure 1E). The evolution distance between normal cells and CD133+ RCC is larger than that between normal cells and CD133− RCC, suggesting that CD133+ RCC cells more likely originated from cancer cells than normal cells.We then selected mutated genes that are shared bymore than three cells in each group for further analysis. Twenty-nine mutated genes were detected in more than 3 CD133+ RCC cells (Figure 1F and Supplementary information, Table S1C), while only 11 mutated genes were shared by over 3 CD133− RCC cells (data not shown). Among the 29 mutated genes detected in CD133+ RCC cells, 18 genes, including KCP (not LOC440563 or LOC440040), were listed in the TCGA RCC database as mutated genes, and the frequency of the 18 mutated genes in the 416 RCC cases in TCGA was less than 2% (Supplementary information, Table S1D).To determine the tumor-propagating potential of each mutation, we introduced heterozygous mutations in the 20 candidate genes, which are related to the function of chromatin remodeling, transcription regulation and self-renewal, in RCC 786-O cells using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique (one mutation/gene), and assay for single cell spherogenicity. In all, 3 out of 20 gene mutations are nonsense mutations and the remaining are missense mutations (Supplementary information, Table S1C). All 20 mutations introduced by the CRISPR-Cas9 system were verified by DNA sequencing (Figure 1H and Supplementary information, Figure S2). Two of the 20 mutations in 786-O cells significantly enhanced the spherogenesis capabilities by more than 10% (Figure 1G, left). The mutation with the highest cancer spherogenesis was in the KPC gene. Because multiple mutations may be required for the maintenance and development of CD133+ RCC cells, we mutated each of the remaining 19 genes in combination with KPC. The LOC440040 mutation was most effective, which enhanced spherogenesis capabilities of the KPC mutation (Figure 1G, middle). We also additionally mutated LOC440563 and found KPC-LOC440040-LOC440563 triple mutation could increase the sphere-formation abilities by more than 30% (Figure 1G, right). To validate that KCP is indeed a prominent driver gene among the 20 candidates, we mutated the LOC440040 and one of the other 19 genes and found that LOC440040 plus KCP double mutations had significantly higher spherogenesis than other combination. Consistently, combining the KPC mutation could increase the sphere-forming ability of cells with the LOC440040-LOC440563 double mutations (Supplementary information, Figure S1F). Moreover, 786-O and 769-P RCC cells with KCP/LOC440040/LOC440563 triple mutations had significant enhancement in cancer spherogenesis capabilities compared with wild-type cells (Figure 1I). Results of xenograft experiments confirmed that more mice developed tumors and had higher enrichment of CSCs in the group that received triple-mutated 786-O or 769-P cells compared with mice that received wild-type cells (Figure 1J), indicating that mutations in the three genes played a key role in the CD133+ RCC tumor-propagating features. Taken together, these results suggest that mutations in KCP, LOC440040 and LOC440563 may facilitate RCC cells to acquire CSC properties.Next, we assessed the mutation rates of KCP, LOC440040, and LOC440563 in a cohort of 57 RCC patients. CD133+ RCC cells in each patient were sorted and subjected to targeted Sanger sequencing. More than 20% of the patients harbored at least one mutation (Figure 1K) and 5.26% (3/57) harbored all three mutations (Supplementary information, Table S1A). The patients with triple mutations showed a significantly shorter tumor-free time after primary tumor resection (Figure 1L). The outside region mutations in RCC remain to be investigated in the future because of the current limitations of targeted Sanger sequencing.In summary, using single-cell exome sequencing, we discovered that CD133+ RCC cells have CSC properties and likely originate from cancer cells instead of from normal renal cells. KCP, LOC440040, and LOC440563 mutations are novel renal cancer stem cell drivers. LOC440563 encodes an RNA-binding protein, which belongs to the subfamily of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs). It influences pre-mRNA processing, metabolism and transport8,9. LOC440563 is significantly mutated in colon cancer; however, the mutations are different from what we identified in RCC CSCs10. Considering the contribution of the hnRNP family to DNA damage repair11, it is possible that the LOC440563 mutation may drive CSC stemness via impairing the DNA repair process. LOC440040 is a GRM5 (glutamate receptor, metabotropic 5) pseudogene. GRM5 belongs to the mGluR family, and dysregulated glutamatergic signaling is involved in many cancer types, such as glioma and melanoma12. However, the relationship between LOC440040 and cancer is currently unknown. It would be interesting to determine whether mutant LOC440040 affects glutamatergic signaling in RCC CSC populations. KCP encodes a secreted protein, which plays complex roles in the regulation of the TGF-β pathway. Abnormal level of KCP may cause myriad renal pathology and cancer13,14,15. It would be interesting to study whether the KCP mutation identified in this work promotes CSC self-renewal via impacting TGF-β signaling. Finally our study indicates KCP, LOC440040, LOC440563 mutations, which are present in at least 20% of patients in our survey, constitute robust and dangerous drivers promoting reprogramming of RCC cancer cells into CSCs. They thus should serve as important prognostic factors and therapeutic targets for RCC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016150"
"cr","Regulation of mATG9 trafficking by Src- and ULK1-mediated phosphorylation in basal and starvation-induced autophagy","Autophagy requires diverse membrane sources and involves membrane trafficking of mATG9, the only membrane protein in the ATG family. However, the molecular regulation of mATG9 trafficking for autophagy initiation remains unclear. Here we identified two conserved classic adaptor protein sorting signals within the cytosolic N-terminus of mATG9, which mediate trafficking of mATG9 from the plasma membrane and trans-Golgi network (TGN) via interaction with the AP1/2 complex. Src phosphorylates mATG9 at Tyr8 to maintain its endocytic and constitutive trafficking in unstressed conditions. In response to starvation, phosphorylation of mATG9 at Tyr8 by Src and at Ser14 by ULK1 functionally cooperate to promote interactions between mATG9 and the AP1/2 complex, leading to redistribution of mATG9 from the plasma membrane and juxta-nuclear region to the peripheral pool for autophagy initiation. Our findings uncover novel mechanisms of mATG9 trafficking and suggest a coordination of basal and stress-induced autophagy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016146"
"cr","A pair of transposon-derived proteins function in a histone acetyltransferase complex for active DNA demethylation","Transposons are generally kept silent by epigenetic mechanisms including DNA methylation. Here, we identified a pair of H arbinger transposon-derived proteins (HDPs), HDP1 and HDP2, as anti-silencing factors in Arabidopsis. hdp1 and hdp2 mutants displayed an enhanced silencing of transgenes and some transposons. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that HDP1 and HDP2 were co-domesticated from the Harbinger transposon-encoded transposase and DNA-binding protein, respectively. HDP1 interacts with HDP2 in the nucleus, analogous to their transposon counterparts. Moreover, HDP1 and HDP2 are associated with IDM1, IDM2, IDM3 and MBD7 that constitute a histone acetyltransferase complex functioning in DNA demethylation. HDP2 and the methyl-DNA-binding protein MBD7 share a large set of common genomic binding sites, indicating that they jointly determine the target specificity of the histone acetyltransferase complex. Thus, our data revealed that HDP1 and HDP2 constitute a functional module that has been recruited to a histone acetyltransferase complex to prevent DNA hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016147"
"cr","Crystal structures of the TRIC trimeric intracellular cation channel orthologues","Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is crucial for muscle contraction, cell growth, apoptosis, learning and memory. The trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channels were recently identified as cation channels balancing the SR and ER membrane potentials, and are implicated in Ca2+ signaling and homeostasis. Here we present the crystal structures of prokaryotic TRIC channels in the closed state and structure-based functional analyses of prokaryotic and eukaryotic TRIC channels. Each trimer subunit consists of seven transmembrane (TM) helices with two inverted repeated regions. The electrophysiological, biochemical and biophysical analyses revealed that TRIC channels possess an ion-conducting pore within each subunit, and that the trimer formation contributes to the stability of the protein. The symmetrically related TM2 and TM5 helices are kinked at the conserved glycine clusters, and these kinks are important for the channel activity. Furthermore, the kinks of the TM2 and TM5 helices generate lateral fenestrations at each subunit interface. Unexpectedly, these lateral fenestrations are occupied with lipid molecules. This study provides the structural and functional framework for the molecular mechanism of this ion channel superfamily.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016140"
"cr","Crystal structure of FabZ-ACP complex reveals a dynamic seesaw-like catalytic mechanism of dehydratase in fatty acid biosynthesis","Fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS) is a vital process in cells. Fatty acids are essential for cell assembly and cellular metabolism. Abnormal FAS directly correlates with cell growth delay and human diseases, such as metabolic syndromes and various cancers. The FAS system utilizes an acyl carrier protein (ACP) as a transporter to stabilize and shuttle the growing fatty acid chain throughout enzymatic modules for stepwise catalysis. Studying the interactions between enzymatic modules and ACP is, therefore, critical for understanding the biological function of the FAS system. However, the information remains unclear due to the high flexibility of ACP and its weak interaction with enzymatic modules. We present here a 2.55 Å crystal structure of type II FAS dehydratase FabZ in complex with holo-ACP, which exhibits a highly symmetrical FabZ hexamer-ACP3 stoichiometry with each ACP binding to a FabZ dimer subunit. Further structural analysis, together with biophysical and computational results, reveals a novel dynamic seesaw-like ACP binding and catalysis mechanism for the dehydratase module in the FAS system, which is regulated by a critical gatekeeper residue (Tyr100 in FabZ) that manipulates the movements of the β-sheet layer. These findings improve the general understanding of the dehydration process in the FAS system and will potentially facilitate drug and therapeutic design for diseases associated with abnormalities in FAS.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016136"
"cr","NgAgo-based fabp11a gene knockdown causes eye developmental defects in zebrafish","A recent report of genome editing using Natronobacterium gregoryi Argonaute (NgAgo) with guide DNA (gDNA) in human cells1 prompted us to explore the utility of this protein for in vivo genetic manipulation in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Zebrafish is a model organism that offers several distinct advantages for studying genetics, developmental biology, vascular biology and disease modeling. In the last several years, loss-of-function genomic editing techniques, including zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs)2,3, artificial transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)4,5 and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 system (CRISPR/Cas9)6,7, have been adopted for zebrafish. Recently the gDNA/NgAgo system has elicited much interest because of some unique advantages: low tolerance to guide-target mismatch, minimum off-target effects, and easy to design1. Here we investigated whether the gDNA/NgAgo system could be used to manipulate zebrafish genes in vivo using fabp11a as a test case.Fatty acid binding protein 11a (Fabp11a) is a member of the family of intracellular FABPs, which play important roles in regulating glucose and lipid homeostasis as well as inflammation8,9. So far, the role of Fabp11a in zebrafish embryonic development remains unclear. To investigate whether 5′-phosphorylated single-strand (ss) DNA can direct NgAgo to disrupt endogenous genes in vivo in zebrafish, we constructed a codon-optimized NgAgo for zebrafish with nuclear localization signal (NLS) peptides at both N-terminus and C-terminus (NgAgo-2nls, Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Data S1). Two 24 bp 5′-phosphorylated ssDNA oligos, forward guide-1 (FW-guide 1) and FW-guide 2 (Supplementary information, Table S1A, which contains other gDNAs used in this study), targeting the second exon and third exon of fabp11a gene (Figure 1B) were synthesized; and each was coinjected with NgAgo-2nls mRNA into 1-cell stage embryos (Figure 1A). Interestingly, we observed that approximately 30% of the injected embryos displayed severe eye phenotypes, either having one very small eye and one relative normal size eye (type 1), or having one large fused eye on the top of the head like Cyclops (type 2), at 30 hours post fertilization (hpf) (Figure 1C and 1D, Supplementary information, Figure S1A(A-C)).Figure 1NgAgo-based fabp11a gene knockdown causes eye developmental defects in zebrafish.

One-Way ANOVA; **** P < 0.0001.Full size imageTo investigate whether the eye phenotype was caused by genetic mutations in fabp11a gene, we extracted genomic DNA from embryos with abnormal eye phenotype and performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the targeted region. Unexpectedly, Sanger sequencing did not uncover any DNA sequence alteration in the targeted region from 57 embryos with eye phenotype we analyzed (data not shown). Instead of DNA mutations, real time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis revealed that the fabp11a gene expression was down-regulated (Figure 1E and Supplementary information, Figure S1A(D)). In contrast, we did not find any specific phenotype in only NgAgo-2nls mRNA- or gDNA-injected embryos (Figure 1D), suggesting that the phenotype was caused by gDNA/NgAgo complex. Coinjection of NgAgo-2nls mRNA with two individual mismatched oligos (Supplementary information, Table S1) did not cause the eye developmental defect (Figure 1D and data not shown), suggesting specificity of the gDNA/NgAgo system. We further designed two reversed gDNAs: RV-guide 1 and 2 complementary to FW-guide 1 and FW-guide 2, respectively. Coinjection of RV-guide 1 or 2 with NgAgo-2nls mRNA into 1-cell stage embryos resulted in abnormal eye development in approximately 15% of embryos (Figure 1D and data not shown). Real time RT-PCR results revealed the reduction of fabp11a expression (Figure 1E). The abnormal eye phenotype caused by gDNA/NgAgo system could be rescued by coinjection of fabp11a mRNA (Figure 1D).To confirm that gDNA/NgAgo system could knock down genes as a general principle in zebrafish, we tested another gene ta (no tail/ntl or brachyury). ta encodes an essential T-box transcription factor required for proper mesoderm formation; zebrafish embryos homozygous for a null ta mutation lack the notochord and tail10,11. Two 24 bp gDNAs were individually injected with NgAgo-2nls mRNA into 1-cell stage embryos; and, at 30 hpf, around 30% injected embryos showed typical no tail phenotype, whereas coinjection of mismatched gDNAs with NgAgo-2nls mRNA resulted in normal embryos (Supplementary information, Figure S1B and data not shown). 40 of the no tail-like embryos were analyzed for insertion/deletion (indel). We did not detect any mutation in the target region by Sanger sequencing (data not shown). Real time RT-PCR revealed that ta expression was down-regulated (Supplementary information, Figure S1B(D)). Furthermore we tested three more genes, kdrl, lama1 and flt1. The gDNA/NgAgo system significantly reduced the expression of these genes and caused specific phenotypes similar to previously reported12,13,14 (Supplementary information, Figure S1C-S1E).To test whether the length of guide DNA can influence knockdown efficiency, we used gDNAs of various lengths (20-27 nt) to target fabp11a and ta. We found that the shorter gDNAs displayed higher knockdown efficiency for both genes (Supplementary information, Figure S1F).We also investigated whether NgAgo could generate indels under certain conditions. We injected NgAgo mRNA mixed with two complementary gDNAs targeting fabp11a and found that the injection caused abnormal eye phenotype but failed to introduce indels (Figure 1D and 1E). Recent report showed that gDNA/NgAgo could generate 11.2%-41.3% indels in human cells at 37 °C1, whereas in our experiments described above the zebrafish were maintained at 28.5 °C. Temperature might be a reason that influences nuclease activity of NgAgo. It has been reported that incubation at a temperature above 32.5 °C may cause malformations of the zebrafish embryo15. We found more than half of the embryos developed normally when they were incubated at 37 °C continuously until phenotypic examination. Under this condition, gDNA/NgAgo injection still failed to introduce indels in fabp11a in 38 embryos exhibiting eye phenotype and in ta in 50 embryos exhibiting no tail-like phenotype (data not shown). Additionally, we mutagenized two aspartic acid residues in NgAgo obtaining NgAgo-D663A, NgAgo-D738A and NgAgo-D663A-D738A, which are predicted to lack the catalytic activity of NgAgo. Coinjection of each mutant NgAgo mRNA with fabp11a FW-gDNA2 efficiently caused the eye developmental defect, with phenotype efficiency of 28.7%, 29.5% and 23.9%, respectively (Supplementary information, Figure S1G(A)). Coinjection of the mutants with ta FW-gDNA1 caused no tail-like phenotype with efficiency of 32.5%, 33.8% and 29.8%, respectively (Supplementary information, Figure S1G(B)). We could not detect any indel either in fabp11a in 25 NgAgo-D663A-D738A mRNA- and fabp11a FW-gDNA 2-injected embryos exhibiting eye phenotype, or in ta in 25 NgAgo-D663A-D738A mRNA- and ta FW-gDNA 1-injected embryos exhibiting no tail-like phenotype.To confirm that the eye developmental defect was caused by fabp11a knockdown, we carried out further investigation. First, we examined the expression pattern of fabp11a at early developmental stages of zebrafish embryos. Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) analysis demonstrated that fabp11a is specifically and highly expressed in the eye field (optic primordium) (Supplementary information, Figure S1H), suggesting fabp11a plays important roles in eye development from an early stage. We next knocked down fabp11a using a translation-blocking morpholino (Supplementary information, Table S1A), whose efficiency was validated (data not shown); and fabp11a morphants showed similar eye defects (Supplementary information, Figure S1I). Interestingly, the knockdown efficiency of gDNA/NgAgo system is higher than that of the morpholino-mediated approach. In addition, we knocked out fabp11a using CRISPR/Cas9 system. We used two gRNAs to target fabp11a locus, and coinjected cas9 mRNA with individual gRNA into one-cell embryos. Both gRNA1 and gRNA2 efficiently induced indels in fabp11a locus with efficiency of 60% and 42.9%, respectively (Supplementary information, Figure S1J(A-D)). gRNA1 resulted in severe eye developmental defect in approximately 30% embryos (Supplementary information, Figure S1J(E and F)); about 10% of total embryos showed extreme eye phenotype with both eyes missing at 48 hpf. In addition, the established fabp11a mutant embryos showed very similar eye developmental defect (Supplementary information, Figure S1J(G)) in the F1 generation, suggesting the fabp11a mutations and the eye abnormal phenotype are heritable.In summary, our study shows that gene knockdown is the main mechanism by which gDNA/NgAgo affects gene function in zebrafish. This is supported by results of the experiments using presumably catalytically dead NgAgo. In addition, we have failed to detect any mutation in all the embryos we examined. Since the catalytically inactive (dead) Cas9 (dCas9):sgRNA complex could efficiently inhibit gene expression through binding to the coding sequence16, we hypothesize that gDNA/NgAgo may bind to a target gene to block its transcription. Overall, we suggest that the gDNA/NgAgo system provides an alternative strategy for gene knockdown in zebrafish.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016134"
"cr","Structural basis for specific recognition of pre-snRNA by Gemin5","The survival of motor neurons (SMN) complex assembles the heptameric rings of Sm proteins (Sm core) on small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) to form small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs)1,2,3,4, the major components of the spliceosome5. The SMN complex consists of SMN, Unrip and Gemin2-86,7. SMN deficiency leads to correspondingly reduced snRNP assembly and is an underlying cause for spinal muscular atrophy, a common motor neuron degenerative disease8. The SMN complex functions to ensure Sm core assembly only on the correct snRNAs, therefore preventing aberrant Sm core formation. Such stringent specificity of the SMN complex toward snRNAs is conferred by Gemin5, which directly interacts with snRNA precursors (pre-snRNAs)9,10,11 and delivers them to sites of Sm core assembly and processing. Gemin5 recognizes the snRNP code comprised of the Sm site (AU5-6G) and an adjacent 3′-terminal stem loop via its N-terminal WD40 repeat domain (termed Gemin5-WD). Gemin5 also has been shown to bind the 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap12 and to downregulate internal ribosome entry site-dependent translation13. Although the function of Gemin5 in the biogenesis of snRNPs has been explored, the molecular mechanism for specific recognition of pre-snRNAs by Gemin5 remains elusive.To reveal the molecular basis for specific recognition of pre-snRNAs by Gemin5, we determined the crystal structures of Gemin5-WD (aa 1-740) in its apo form and in complex with an m7GpppG cap analog and the Sm site RNA (5′-AAUUUUUGAC-3′ corresponding to nt 118-127 in pre-U4 snRNA) at resolutions of 3.0, 2.57 and 2.49 Å, respectively (Supplementary information, Table S1). Gemin5-WD contains 14 repeats of canonical WD40-motifs that fold into two connected seven-bladed β-propellers (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). The two doughnut-shaped propellers (WD1: blades 1-7, aa 19-377 and WD2: blades 8-14, aa 3-10 and 428-712) are similar in size, each ∼38 Å in diameter and ∼55 Å high, and twisted ∼15° askew relative to one another. The extreme N-terminal region of WD1 forms the outermost β-strand of blade 14 in WD2. Such a structural motif referred to as “molecular velcro” has been observed in the structures of Aip1 (Supplementary information, Figure S1A).The structure of the Gemin5-WD/m7GpppG complex shows that the capped guanosine, m7G is inserted into the pocket at the top surface of WD2 (Figure 1A), whereas the other guanosine is not observed in the electron density map (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). Specifically, m7G is sandwiched between the aromatic ring of Tyr474 and the side chains of Leu580 and Asn582 (Figure 1B). In addition to the stacking interactions, the main chain carbonyl groups of Thr540 and Asn582, and the side chain carboxyl group of Glu541 are hydrogen bonded to the N1 and N2 atoms of m7G, respectively, whereas the side chains of Tyr474, Tyr660 and Arg684 form hydrogen bonds with the α- and γ-phosphate groups. Additional contacts involve the side chain of Lys641 and the ribose ring and the β-phosphate group. Consistent with the structure, mutations of invariant Tyr474, Lys641, Tyr660 and Arg684 (Supplementary information, Figure S1C) to Ala abolished the cap-binding activity of Gemin5, underscoring the importance of these residues in cap recognition (Figure 1C). The recognition of m7G by Gemin5 is specific as placing a trimethylated (Tri-mG) cap into the position occupied by the m7G cap would cause severe steric clashes with the neighboring residues (Supplementary information, Figure S1D). Gemin5-WD recognizes the m7G cap in a manner similar to those observed in the structures of CBC20, eIF4E, PARN and DcpS in complex with m7GpppG (Supplementary information, Figure S1E).Figure 1Specific recognition of m7GpppG cap and the Sm site of pre-snRNA by Gemin5-WD. (A) Overall structure of Gemin5-WD in complex with m7GpppG cap. WD1 and WD2 of Gemin5-WD are shown in light blue and green, respectively. m7Gppp of the cap is shown in purple.

(C) Cap-binding assays were performed with wild-type (WT) Gemin5-WD and its mutants. (D) Electrostatic surface potential of Gemin5-WD complexed with Sm RNA (−7.5–7.5 kT/e). Sm RNA (nt 118-127 in pre-U4) used in the study is shown with specificity-determining nucleotides in red and those not observed in the structure in grey. (E) Interactions of Sm RNA with Gemin5-WD. (F) Fluorescence anisotropy measurements of Sm RNA (nt 118-127) binding with Gemin5-WD and its variants. (G) RNA-binding assays of Gemin5-WD in the absence or the presence of 2.5-fold excess of m7GpppG. Sm RNA (nt 118-127) and longer U4-RNA (nt 85-145 in pre-U4) are used. (H) The specificity determinants of Sm RNA for Gemin5 recognition were examined by fluorescence anisotropy.Full size imageThe structure of Gemin5-Sm RNA complex shows that the Sm site RNA binds to a positively charged concave surface formed between the two β-propellers WD1 and WD2 (Figure 1D). Gemin5-WD does not show significant conformational changes upon Sm RNA binding, as superposition of Gemin5-Sm RNA structure onto the apo-form gives a root mean-square deviation of 0.3 Å (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). Out of the 10 nucleotides used for crystallization, only 7 nucleotides are observed in the electron density map (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). The bound Sm RNA displays an extended conformation with a U-shaped bend between U3 and U5, such that the uridine base of U4 flips out, pointing in the direction opposite to those of U3 and U5. The 5′ end of the Sm RNA contacts blade 8, and the 3′ end contacts blade 14 with majority of the interactions involving residues from WD1.The Sm RNA is recognized specifically through two grooves formed on either side of Tyr15 in WD1 (Figure 1D). Tyr15 stacks against a flipped nucleotide U4 in the bound RNA. Toward the 5′ end of U4 is a shallow groove formed between blades 7 and 8 that holds nucleotides U3 and A2. The specificity of A2 and U3 is ensured by hydrogen-bonding interactions between their bases and the guanidinium group of Arg335 (Figure 1E). U3 and A2 stack against each other as well as against the first nucleobase, A1. Trp422 belonging to blade 8 of WD2 completes the interaction through stacking against A1. Toward the 3′ end of U4 is a pocket formed by residues Trp14, Arg359, Asn13 and Arg33, which holds the nucleobases U5 and U6. Trp14 stacks against U5, which in turn stacks against U6. Arg359 and the main chain amide group of Trp14 recognize the base of U5, whereas Asn13 recognizes the base of U6. The side chain of Arg33 is hydrogen-bonded to the ribose of U6 and the subsequent phosphate moiety. The terminal nucleobase of U7 stacks against Phe381 and is surrounded by hydrophobic residues Tyr383 and Phe705 (Figure 1E). In contrast to our structure showing the specific recognition of RNA, the WD40 domain of DDB2 recognizes dsDNA in a sequence-independent manner14 (Supplementary information, Figure S1F). These results confirm that WD40 domain is a versatile nucleic acid-binding module in addition to its role in protein-protein interactions.To further characterize the role of residues involved in Sm RNA binding, we mutated several conserved residues (Supplementary information, Figure S1C) in Gemin5-WD and checked the mutational effects on RNA binding (Figure 1F). Of the mutants we generated, mutation of Trp14 or Tyr15 to Ala completely abolished the RNA-binding ability of Gemin5, whereas single Ala substitution of Phe381 dramatically reduced RNA binding, underscoring the essential role of these three residues in Sm RNA binding. As Sm RNA-binding and cap-binding sites on Gemin5-WD are in close proximity, we also investigated whether Sm RNA binding-defective mutants, W14A, Y15A and F381A can bind the cap analog. As expected, these mutants showed similar binding affinity to that of the wild-type protein (Supplementary information, Figure S1G). Furthermore, RNA-binding assays in the presence of 2.5-fold excess of m7GpppG showed that m7GpppG had no effect on Gemin5-WD's binding to RNA (Figure 1G). Taken together, these results suggest that Gemin5 recognizes the Sm site and the m7G cap of the pre-snRNA through two distinct binding sites.Gemin5 has been shown to specifically recognize the 5′-AUUUUUG-3′ Sm site sequence of HSUR5 RNA of HVS with the first adenosine and the first and third uridines (corresponding to A2, U3 and U5 in Figure 1E) corresponding to the specificity determinants of pre-snRNA for Gemin5 recognition9. Moreover, pre-U1 snRNA containing a non-canonical Sm site 5′-AUUUGUG-3′ shows relatively weaker affinity to Gemin511. To verify the specificity determinants, we examined Gemin5-WD binding activities towards mutated Sm RNAs (Figure 1H). Substitution of A2 to G significantly decrease the RNA binding to Gemin5-WD, whereas the RNA binding was abolished when either U3 or U5 was substituted to C. Consistent with these findings, the specificity of A2 and U3 is ensured by the hydrogen bonds from the side chain of Arg335 to the purine and pyrimidine rings of A2 and U3, respectively. The specificity of U5 is provided by the hydrogen bonds between its base and Arg359. U6 corresponds to G5 in pre-U1 snRNA; substitution of U6 to G in the structure of Gemin5-Sm RNA would cause steric clashes with the main chain of Arg33 and side chain of Asn13.Trp286 has been reported to be a key residue for the recognition of both m7G and the Sm site RNA11,12. However, Trp286 is located in a hydrophobic core of blade 6 of WD1, contacting Tyr15, which stacks against the flipped nucleotide U4 (Supplementary information, Figure S1H). Mutation of this residue is likely to destabilize the conformation of Tyr15, therefore affecting RNA binding. Trp286 is located far away from the cap-binding site. Therefore, it is unlikely to be involved in cap binding as suggested by Bradrick and Gromeier12. An alternative possibility is that mutation of Trp286 would disrupt the fold of Gemin5, thereby abolishing both cap and RNA binding of Gemin5. Consistent with this notion, we found that mutation of Trp286 to Ala led to the mutant protein being expressed in the inclusion bodies and insoluble.In summary, we report structures of the WD40 domain of Gemin5 in complex with the m7G cap and the Sm site RNA. Gemin5 specifically recognizes the Sm RNA and the m7G cap through its first and second β-propellers, respectively. This dual recognition mechanism ensures the assembly of Sm core only on correct snRNAs, thereby preventing illicit Sm core formation. Our results provide a framework for further elucidating how Gemin5 delivers pre-snRNAs to the SMN complex for the biogenesis of snRNPs. The atomic coordinates and structure factors for apo Gemin5-WD, Gemin5-WD/m7GpppG and Gemin5-WD/Sm RNA complex structures have been deposited into Protein Data Bank under the accession code of 5H3S, 5H3T, 5H3U respectively.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016133"
"cr","DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility profiling of mouse and human fetal germ cells","Chromatin remodeling is important for the epigenetic reprogramming of human primordial germ cells. However, the comprehensive chromatin state has not yet been analyzed for human fetal germ cells (FGCs). Here we use nucleosome occupancy and methylation sequencing method to analyze both the genome-wide chromatin accessibility and DNA methylome at a series of crucial time points during fetal germ cell development in both human and mouse. We find 116 887 and 137 557 nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs) in human and mouse FGCs, covering a large set of germline-specific and highly dynamic regulatory genomic elements, such as enhancers. Moreover, we find that the distal NDRs are enriched specifically for binding motifs of the pluripotency and germ cell master regulators such as NANOG, SOX17, AP2γ and OCT4 in human FGCs, indicating the existence of a delicate regulatory balance between pluripotency-related genes and germ cell-specific genes in human FGCs, and the functional significance of these genes for germ cell development in vivo. Our work offers a comprehensive and high-resolution roadmap for dissecting chromatin state transition dynamics during the epigenomic reprogramming of human and mouse FGCs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016128"
"cr","Complex structure of the fission yeast SREBP-SCAP binding domains reveals an oligomeric organization","Sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors are master regulators of cellular lipid homeostasis in mammals and oxygen-responsive regulators of hypoxic adaptation in fungi. SREBP C-terminus binds to the WD40 domain of SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP), which confers sterol regulation by controlling the ER-to-Golgi transport of the SREBP-SCAP complex and access to the activating proteases in the Golgi. Here, we biochemically and structurally show that the carboxyl terminal domains (CTD) of Sre1 and Scp1, the fission yeast SREBP and SCAP, form a functional 4:4 oligomer and Sre1-CTD forms a dimer of dimers. The crystal structure of Sre1-CTD at 3.5 Å and cryo-EM structure of the complex at 5.4 Å together with in vitro biochemical evidence elucidate three distinct regions in Sre1-CTD required for Scp1 binding, Sre1-CTD dimerization and tetrameric formation. Finally, these structurally identified domains are validated in a cellular context, demonstrating that the proper 4:4 oligomeric complex formation is required for Sre1 activation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016123"
"cr","Inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 mediates prolonged prophase I arrest in female germ cells and is essential for female reproductive lifespan","A unique feature of female germ cell development in mammals is their remarkably long arrest at the prophase of meiosis I, which lasts up to 50 years in humans. Both dormant and growing oocytes are arrested at prophase I and completely lack the ability to resume meiosis. Here, we show that the prolonged meiotic arrest of female germ cells is largely achieved via the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 (cyclin-dependent kinase 1). In two mouse models where we have introduced mutant Cdk1T14AY15F which cannot be inhibited by phosphorylation (Cdk1AF) in small meiotically incompetent oocytes, the prophase I arrest is interrupted, leading to a premature loss of female germ cells. We show that in growing oocytes, Cdk1AF leads to premature resumption of meiosis with condensed chromosomes and germinal vesicle breakdown followed by oocyte death, whereas in dormant oocytes, Cdk1AF leads to oocyte death directly, and both situations damage the ovarian reserve that maintains the female reproductive lifespan, which should be around 1 year in mice. Furthermore, interruption of the inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 results in DNA damage, which is accompanied by induction of the Chk2 (checkpoint kinase 2)-p53/p63-dependent cell death pathway, which eventually causes global oocyte death. Together, our data demonstrate that the phosphorylation-mediated suppression of Cdk1 activity is one of the crucial factors that maintain the lengthy prophase arrest in mammalian female germ cells, which is essential for preserving the germ cell pool and reproductive lifespan in female mammals.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016119"
"cr","Neuropeptide signals cell non-autonomous mitochondrial unfolded protein response","Neurons have a central role in the systemic coordination of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and the cell non-autonomous modulation of longevity. However, the mechanism by which the nervous system senses mitochondrial stress and communicates to the distal tissues to induce UPRmt remains unclear. Here we employ the tissue-specific CRISPR-Cas9 approach to disrupt mitochondrial function only in the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans, and reveal a cell non-autonomous induction of UPRmt in peripheral cells. We further show that a neural sub-circuit composed of three types of sensory neurons, and one interneuron is required for sensing and transducing neuronal mitochondrial stress. In addition, neuropeptide FLP-2 functions in this neural sub-circuit to signal the non-autonomous UPRmt. Taken together, our results suggest a neuropeptide coordination of mitochondrial stress response in the nervous system.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016118"
"cr","The genome-wide mutational landscape of pituitary adenomas","Pituitary adenomas (PAs) are one of the most common intracranial tumors, which can result in significant morbidity and can cause mortality either by exerting central pressure effects from the pituitary mass or by secreting excessive pituitary hormones1. Depending on their capability to produce hormones, PAs are classified as clinically functioning and nonfunctioning (NF). Functioning PAs include 6 subtypes, characterized by hypersecretion of prolactin (PRL), growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), gonadotropins including follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone (GT), thyrotropin (TSH) or multiple hormones (plurihormonal), respectively. We and other group recently reported the recurrent genetic mutations in ACTH-PAs2,3. Previous studies also identified genetic alterations in GH-PAs by whole-genome and -exome sequencing4,5 and in 7 NF-PAs by exome analysis6. Due to challenges in collection and preparation of PA samples, exome-wide sequencing of other subtypes, including the PRL-, GT-, TSH-, and plurihormonal PA subtypes, has not been reported yet.To provide a comprehensive genetic landscape of all 7 subtypes of PAs, we examined the somatic mutational landscape of 125 PAs, including 20 NF-PAs, 20 PRL-PAs, 20 GH-PAs, 20 ACTH-PAs, 20 GT-PAs, 10 TSH-PAs, and 15 plurihormonal PAs. Plurihormonal PAs in this series secreted GH+PRL (n = 11), GH+ACTH (n = 2), or GH+TSH (n = 2). The analysis of 20 ACTH-PAs included 12 tumor samples analyzed in our previous study2. The clinical characteristics of these patients are summarized in Supplementary information, Table S1A. The detailed methods are described in Supplementary information, Data S1 and Figure S1A. We identified 412 somatic mutations in 125 PAs (Supplementary information, Table S1B). This analysis confirmed a relatively low number of somatic mutations per tumor across all 7 PA subtypes (mean = 3.3 mutations per exome; Figure 1A)3,4,5,6. The predominant substitution was C>T/G>A transitions which accounted for 41% of all substitutions across all PA subtypes, followed by T>C/A>G transitions (23%), similar to other intracranial tumors (Supplementary information, Figure S1B).Figure 1(A) Somatic mutational and SCNA landscape of PAs. Tumor subtypes based on hormone secretion profile, patient age and gender, mutations in recurrently-mutated genes, number of mutations in each tumor subtype and relative number of different single-nucleotide substitutions in each tumor subtype are shown for 125 PAs. Copy number gain of SYCP1, SYCP2, and RAD21L1, as well as overall percentage of the genome disrupted by copy number variations, are all shown based on GISTIC analysis. (B) Significantly enriched pathways in each subtype based on pathway enrichment analysis. Bipartite network of the association between subtypes and pathways, where a yellow node represents a subtype, a pink node represents a pathway, and the line between these two types of nodes indicates that the pathway was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with the subtype. Blue lines illustrate associations between a PA subtype and a molecular pathway based on our data in combination with previous whole-exome sequence data. The green lines show the associations between PA subtypes and well-known pathways based on prior publications. (C) Interconnections between each subtype based on pathway analysis. Each pair of subtypes is linked by a line with width corresponding to the number of pathways (containing at least two mutated genes) shared by both subtypes. Node size reflects the number of pathways shared by any other subtypes. (D) The landscape of potential drug targets in 125 PAs. Genes encoding potential drug targets in seven altered pathways are shown. Genes mutated in PAs in this study are shown in ovals. Genes in blue ovals indicate cancer-related genes. Gene names in brown indicate potential drug targets, with their FDA-approved drugs shown in adjacent brown boxes. Orange stars indicate that drugs tested in phases I-III clinical trials are available to target the gene.Full size imageRecurrently-mutated genes are shown in Figure 1A. We confirmed mutations in G protein subunit α (GNAS), ubiquitin-specific protease 8 (USP8), Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 3 Group C Member 1 (NR3C1), and Menin 1 (MEN1) in PAs and identified new somatic variants in these genes. Activating mutations of GNAS have long been known to play a role in pathogenesis of GH-PAs7. In this study, GNAS mutations were identified in 54% of all GH-secreting tumors, including 8 of 20 GH-monosecreting tumors and 11 of 15 plurihormonal tumors that secreted GH and another hormone. The high frequency of GNAS mutations in GH-PAs is consistent with previous findings4. GNAS alterations included p.R201C (n = 14), p.R201H (n = 1), p.Q227L (n = 3) and a novel p.G49R (n = 1) mutation. USP8 is a deubiquitinating enzyme that protects growth factor receptors including EGFR from degradation. Highly frequent USP8 mutations in ACTH-PAs have been shown by our group and others2,3. In this study, USP8 mutations were identified in 11 out of 20 ACTH-PAs, among which all mutation types have been described previously2,3. We also identified novel truncation mutations in the glucocorticoid receptor gene NR3C1 in two ACTH-PAs that did not contain USP8 mutations: p.Q632X-p.S512fs and p.R714P-p.630_630del. This is consistent with previous findings implicating mutations targeting NR3C1 as an uncommon contributor to ACTH-PA pathogenesis2. We additionally identified two novel somatic loss-of-function mutations in MEN1, including c.208_214del:p.D70fs and c.G608A:p.W203X, both in plurihormonal PAs producing GH and PRL from patients without a history of familial MEN syndrome and without germline MEN1 mutations. While germline MEN1 mutations have long been linked to PAs, MEN1 mutations have also been reported as rare somatic events in sporadic PAs8.We also identified recurrently-mutated kinesin heavy chain isoform 5A (KIF5A) and growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (GRB10) as novel targets in two PA patients, respectively. KIF5A is a member of the kinesin family of proteins, which participates in a multisubunit complex to promote intracellular organelle transport. Somatic KIF5A mutations are found in prostate cancer9, but had not been linked to PAs. We identified somatic mutations targeting the stalk (p.Y749C) and tail (p.T938I) domains of KIF5A in two PAs. GRB10 encodes an intracellular adapter protein which interacts with several receptor tyrosine kinases and downstream signaling molecules to regulate secretion of insulin and other peptides10. We identified novel mutations in GRB10 including p.L357F and p.T155S, both in GH-PAs (2 out of 20 GH-PAs, 10%), one of which also contained a GNAS mutation, while the other one did not. GRB10 mutations in GH-PAs implicate GRB10 in the pathogenesis of GH-PAs. In addition, mutations of other genes, such as IARS, SP100 and TRIP12, occurred in two cases (Figure 1A).We next focused on somatic copy number alternations (SCNA) in our panel of 125 PAs (Supplementary information, Figure S1C). We found that 18% (22/125) of samples had SCNA involving < 10% of the genome; and 32% (40/125) had considerably greater levels of genomic disruption, with > 80% of the genome involved. We observed frequent loss of chromosomes 11q13.2 (q-value = 1.01E-18) and 11p15.5 (q-value = 1.14E-16), consistent with the previous study11. We also observed loss of 1p36.31 (q-value = 1.0098E-18), 9q34.11 (q-value = 2.39E-18), 16p13.3 (q-value = 5.82E-18), and 3p21.31 (q-value = 1.34E-17), and frequent gain of 20q13.33 (q-value = 1.47E-29), 3p22.3 (q-value = 3.10E-22), 1q31.3 (q-value = 5.06E-18), 7q21.11 (q-value = 1.54E-17), and 16q12.2 (q-value = 2.59E-21). Our copy number data revealed frequent gains in regions encoding cohesin complex genes including synaptonemal complex genes SYCP1 on 1p13.2 and SYCP2 on 20q13.33 and RAD21 cohesin complex like 1 (RAD21L1) gene on 20p13 (Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Figure S1C). The identification of frequent amplifications in cohesin complex genes implicates cohesin deregulation in PA pathogenesis12. We found no significant association between SCNA as well as gains of cohesin complex regions and clinical features and PA subtypes.To determine whether any molecular pathways are preferentially targeted by mutations in different PA subtypes, we performed gene set enrichment analysis using annotation based on the KEGG database (P < 0.05). NF-, GH-, PRL-, plurihormonal and ACTH-PAs were enriched for somatic mutations in overlapping molecular pathways such as Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, cGMP-PKG, oxytocin, insulin and cAMP signalings (Figure 1B). Interconnection based on pathway analysis between each subtype also suggested that GH-, PRL-, plurihormonal and ACTH-PAs are closely related with each other (Figure 1C). On the other hand, TSH- and GT-PAs were enriched for somatic mutations in a distinct set of molecular pathways. In contrast to the other pituitary-secreted hormones which are polypeptides, TSH and GT are glycoproteins which share an identical α subunit. Moreover, TSH- and GT-secreting pituitary cells are both dependent on the transcription factor GATA binding protein 2 (GATA-2) during differentiation, while ACTH-, GH- and PRL-secreting cells are GATA-2 independent13. Our pathway analysis raises the possibility that TSH- and GT-PAs may share features of their molecular pathogenesis.Medical treatment for PAs is limited and patients frequently require lifelong treatment. Genomic alterations identified in targetable genes may be useful to identify PA patients who could potentially benefit from targeted treatment in future clinical trials. For example, USP8 mutation, by activating EGFR-MAPK signaling, accounts for about 50% of ACTH-PAs2,3. This provides a rationale for an effective treatment for patients with USP8-mutated ACTH-PAs by inhibiting USP8 catalytic activity or by anti-EGFR therapy, although anti-EGFR therapy has been shown to be promising in vitro and in animal models of ACTH-PAs in general14. We further sought to determine whether any potentially actionable cellular pathways are disrupted by mutations in PAs. We found 7 pathways enriched for cancer-related genes that were mutated in our series of 125 PAs (Figure 1D): cAMP signaling, cell cycle, PI3K-Akt signaling, immune response signaling, MAPK signaling, endocrine signaling and Rap1 signaling pathways. We next analyzed 48 existing drugs which target a critical molecule in one of these 7 pathways. Among those 48 drugs, 21 drugs are FDA-approved and 27 drugs are in phases I-III clinical trials. Genes encoding drug targets inthese pathways included FGF4, GNAS, HDAC4, NFkB1, NOS3 and SYK (Supplementary information, Table S1C). Altogether, 28% of PA patients in this series had tumors with a mutation in a potentially actionable gene in one of these 7 pathways. This analysis suggests that using drugs to directly target the disrupted pathways may not be a straight forward approach in PAs, as potentially actionable pathways disrupted by somatic mutations were heterogeneous among PAs and were only found in a minority of tumors.We then attempted to identify links between our mutational data and the clinical characteristics of PA patients. We retrospectively collected clinical information of these patients, including age, tumor size, clinical presentation, and invasion for our entire set of 125 PAs (Supplementary information, Table S1A). Invasiveness is one of the most important clinical phenotypes of PAs. Invasive PAs are always life threatening due to severe symptoms, high mortality and morbidity after surgery, and high incidence of post-operative recurrence. In our cohort, 157 mutations were detected in the invasive tumor group and 222 mutations were in the non-invasive group. As a whole, no significant difference was observed in the number of mutations or the number of targetable mutations or pathways between the invasive and non-invasive tumors.In GH-PAs, GNAS mutation has been linked to tumor invasion and drug resistance to somatostatin analogs such as octreotide in several studies but not others15. In our cohort, GNAS mutation was inversely correlated with tumor invasiveness as determined by pathologic analysis, in which 40% of the GNAS-mutated tumors showed invasion compared to 60% of the GNAS-WT tumors with invasion (P = 0.036). Also, GNAS mutation was associated with drug resistance, with 15.4% of the GNAS-mutated tumors showing resistance versus 84.6% of the GNAS-WT tumors showing resistance (P = 0.001). We also confirmed that ACTH-PAs with mutated USP8 were significantly smaller in size than those with wild-type USP8 (mean = 1.0 vs 1.9 cm in maximum dimension, P < 0.001)2. No other significant associations were observed between mutations and basic clinical data, either among the group of all PAs or among any PA subtypes.In summary, we for the first time present a currently largest genome-wide mutational and SCNA landscape of PAs and a comprehensive genetic landscape for all 7 PA subtypes. We confirmed GNAS mutations in GH-PAs, USP8 mutations in ACTH-PAs, and revealed new somatic variants of GNAS, MEN1 and NR3C1. Further, we identified KIF5A and GRB10 as novel recurrently-mutated genes in PAs. Molecular pathways related to specific pituitary hormones were differentially targeted by genetic alterations in the various PA subtypes, and a subset of tumors contained genetic alterations in pathways that may be amenable to therapeutic interventions. This study provides insights into PA pathogenesis and may allow for the design of functional studies that further delineate the biologic basis of the various PA subtypes. We estimated that exome sequencing of 20 samples would identify genes mutated at 30% frequency among a single subtype. Further studies with much larger sample sizes will be needed to identify driver mutations occurring at a lower frequency in these subtypes. Future studies will also be needed to identify whether miRNAs, noncoding regions, or methylation-related events may contribute to the pathogenesis of PAs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016114"
"cr","A CRISPR evolutionary arms race: structural insights into viral anti-CRISPR/Cas responses","CRISPR/Cas systems are widespread RNA-mediated prokaryotic adaptive immune systems providing protection against invading nucleic acids1. However, throughout evolution, this host defense system has not resulted in the eradication of phages, suggesting that phages have evolved counter strategies to thrive within bacteria despite these mechanisms2. Thus, both bacterial CRISPR system and phage anti-CRISPR system are part of a continuing evolutionary battle between bacterial host and their bacteriophage invaders.The fight against phages through CRISPR/Cas systems occurs in three stages. For example, for the type I-F CRISPR/Cas system, Cas1 and Cas2 proteins first insert a short segment 'spacer' derived from the foreign DNAs into the CRISPR locus. Subsequently, the CRISPR array is transcribed into a long precursor crRNA, which is further processed into the mature crRNA by Csy4 protein. Finally, this stable Csy4-crRNA complex subsequently assembles with Csy1, Cys2 and Csy3 protein, forming a crRNA-guided surveillance complex (named Csy complex) (Figure 1A). The Csy complex specifically recognizes the complementary target DNA and recruits Cas3 to degrade the invading DNA3.Figure 1Viral AcrF3 dimer binds to PaeCas3 protein, inactivating the bacterial CRISPR system. (A) Graphic representation of the P. aeruginosa CRISPR/Cas locus. The CRISPR locus consists of series of repeats (gray diamonds) separated by spacer sequences (blue rectangles). Four Csy genes are shown in cyan, Cas1 in yellow and the fused Cas2-Cas3 in green. (B) Overall crystal structure of AcrF3 (left panel) and the interactions between two monomers (right panel).

(F) Close-up view of interactions between PaeCas3 and AcrF3 dimer. One AcrF3 monomer interacts with HD domain and Linker of Cas3 (left panel); and the other AcrF3 monomer interacts with CTD domain of Cas3 (right panel). (G) AcrF3 dimer blocks the replaced non-complementary DNA access of Cas3. AcrF3 is shown as cartoon. (H) Model of AcrF3 inactivating CRISPR/Cas immune system. (I) Model of Cas1-Cas2-Cas3 complex.Full size imageTo proliferate inside their bacterial hosts, phages must overcome bacterial defense mechanisms, such as the CRISPR/Cas immune system. It was shown earlier that within a population, certain phages display a mutation in the protospacer or in the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), thus evading CRISPR targeting. Recently, an alternative approach for evading CRISPR/Cas activity, which lacks a requirement for mutation in the protospacer or PAM region4, was described for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The anti-CRISPR prophages contain a set of atypical genes encoding five small phage proteins involved in inactivating the CRISPR/Cas system. Subsequently, another study characterized three of these anti-CRISPR proteins (AcrF)5. AcrF1 and AcrF2 directly bind to the Csy complex, thus blocking target DNA binding. In comparison, AcrF3 interacts directly with the Cas3 protein and blocks its recruitment into Csy complex, thus protects the phage DNA from being degraded by the CRISPR/Cas system.While previous studies have provided crucial first insights into the molecular mechanisms of anti-CRISPR activities, it remains to be elucidated as to how the AcrF3 inhibits crRNA interference. To find answers to this question, we set out to solve the crystal structure of AcrF3 and the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of AcrF3-Cas3 complex. Our structural analysis provides important insights into how the AcrF3 dimer binds Cas3 protein at the entrance of non-complementary strand into Cas3. As a result, recruitment of Cas3 by the Csy complex is inhibited, thus effectively preventing the degradation of phage DNA by the CRISPR/Cas system.To reveal the molecular details of how AcrF3 inhibits CRISPR/Cas activity, we performed crystal structure analysis of the cloned and purified AcrF3 protein encoded by gene 35 from phage JBD5. The structure of the seleno-methionine substituted AcrF3 was solved to 1.5 Å resolution (Supplementary information, Table S1). As shown in Figure 1B, the AcrF3 is a dimer, with each monomer comprising six α-helices. Dimer formation is facilitated by the interaction between the first α-helices of two AcrF3 subunits (Figure 1B).To understand how the AcrF3 protein interacts with type I-F P. aeruginosa Cas3 (Figure 1C), we prepared the PaeCas3-AcrF3 complex (Supplementary information, Figure S1A and S1B), and solved the cryo-EM structure of PaeCas3-AcrF3 complex at resolution of 4.2 Å using cryo-EM single particle method (Figure 1D). In the 4.2 Å density map, the secondary structures such as α-helix and β-strand were resolved (Supplementary information, Figure S1C-S1F). A model of PaeCas3 was built based on the electron density map and the crystal structure of AcrF3 dimer fits well to the density of the rest of the map. However, due to the flexibility, certain loops were not resolved and remained unidentified in the map.Similar to Thermobifida fusca Cas3 (TfuCas3)6 and Thermobaculum terrenum Cas3 (TteCas3)7, PaeCas3 also contains five conserved domains: HD, Rec1, Rec2, Linker and CTD, and the helicase domain forms a cleft to accommodate single-stranded DNA (Figure 1E). In order to analyze the conformational change of Cas3 induced by AcrF3 binding, we performed a structural comparison of PaeCas3, TfuCas3 and TteCas3. As shown in Supplementary information, Figure S1G, the structures of the Rec1 and Rec2 domains are well conserved, despite their low sequence similarity. The topology of Rec1 and Rec2 are nearly identical for PaeCas3, TfuCas3 and TteCas3, except for the presence of two additional α helices in TfuCas3 and TteCas3. In contrast, the HD and CTD domains exhibit significant differences among PaeCas3, TfuCas3 and TteCas3.As shown in Figure 1D, the AcrF3 is present as a dimer in the Cas3-AcrF3 complex. One AcrF3 monomer interacts with the HD and Linker of Cas3 protein, and the other monomer interacts with the CTD domain (Figure 1F). Thus, AcrF3 dimer connects the HD and CTD domains of Cas3, and covers the cleft formed inside Cas3 protein (Figure 1G). The Cas3 protein is recruited by the Csy complex following pairing of the crRNA bases with those of the complementary strand, generating an R-loop conformation with a displaced non-complementary strand. Interestingly, the AcrF3 dimer binding site of Cas3 is the entrance of the displaced single-stranded DNA associated with Cas3, suggesting that the AcrF3 dimer blocks the access to Cas3 of the non-target DNA (Figure 1H). Without Cas3 recruitment by the Csy-dsDNA complex, the CRISPR/Cas system is unable to efficiently destroy the invading phage DNA, resulting in the escape of phages from the immune response.As shown in Figure 1F the loop between α6 and α7, and the loop between α5 and α6 of HD domain interact with one AcrF3. In the PaeCas3 CTD domain, the loop between α36 and β22, and the loop between β19 and β20 interact with the other AcrF3 monomer. In order to investigate whether AcrF3 is able to bind other Cas3, we aligned the PaeCas3, TfuCas3 and TteCas3 protein sequences. As shown in Supplementary information, Figure S1H, the Rec1 and Rec2 sequences are conserved, whereas the regions of Cas3 interacting with AcrF3 (highlighted by a blue box in Supplementary information, Figure S1H) are not conserved, suggesting that AcrF3 cannot bind TfuCas3 and TteCas3 proteins. This is in agreement with earlier result showing that the AcrF3 protein is highly specific for the Pseudomonas I-F CRISPR system4.Cas3 plays critical roles during the process of primed spacer acquisition. When crRNA interference is unsuccessful due to the phage mutation, some infected bacterial host cells survive by acquiring new spacer sequences directly from the invading phage genome8. In addition to Cas1 and Cas2, Csy complex and the Cas3 nuclease are involved during the primed acquisition. Recently, it was found that the Cas1-Cas2 complex associates with the Cas3 protein during primed acquisition9. The degradation products of Cas3 are used by Cas1-Cas2 as precursors for new spacers.In the type I-F CRISPR system, Cas2 and Cas3 are coded by one gene as a fused protein, with Cas2 located at the N-terminal of Cas3. During the preparation of our manuscript, a similar crystal structure of AcrF3 bound with Cas3 complex was published10 (Supplementary information, Figure S1I). While Cas2 was clearly observed in this reported AcrF3-Cas3 structure, Cas2 is disordered in our cryo-EM complex structure due to the flexibility of this region. To reveal whether the presence of AcrF3 protein affects spacer acquisition and to gain knowledge of the Cas1-Cas2-Cas3 complex, we made the model of Cas1-Cas2-Cas3 complex (Figure 1I) by superposing the Cas2 from structure 5B7I and the Cas2 protein in the Cas1-Cas2 complex11. The Cas1-Cas2-Cas3 complex contains two Cas1 dimers, one Cas2 dimer and two Cas3 proteins, with Cas2 dimer sandwiched by two Cas1 dimers and two Cas3 proteins from orthogonal direction. Cas3 associates with Cas1-Cas2 complex by the interaction between its Rec1 domain and Cas2. The AcrF3 dimer binding surface is located on the opposite site of Cas2, suggesting that AcrF3 has little effect on the assembly of the Cas1-Cas2-Cas3 complex. Thus is unlikely to interfere with primed acquisition directly. However, AcrF3 inhibits Cas3 recruitment by Csy-dsDNA complex, thus stopping the generation of the precursor protospacer DNA. As a result, phage AcrF3 protein blocks both crRNA interference and spacer acquisition.In conclusion, our structural analysis of the Cas3-AcrF3 complex revealed that the AcrF3 dimer binds to HD, Linker and CTD domains of the Cas3 protein, therefore blocking the replaced non-complementary DNA access of Cas3. Therefore, AcrF3 inhibits crRNA-mediated DNA degradation via inhibiting recruitment of Cas3 by Csy complex. In addition, inhibition of Cas3-guided DNA degradation also blocks primed spacer acquisition. In summary, the AcrF3 dimer overcomes the CRISPR system at both the crRNA interference and the primed acquisition stages. Our studies provide new insights into the ongoing molecular arms race between viral parasites and the immune systems of their hosts.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016103"
"cr","Pyroptosis is driven by non-selective gasdermin-D pore and its morphology is different from MLKL channel-mediated necroptosis","Necroptosis and pyroptosis are two forms of programmed cell death with a common feature of plasma membrane rupture. Here we studied the morphology and mechanism of pyroptosis in comparison with necroptosis. Different from necroptosis, pyroptosis undergoes membrane blebbing and produces apoptotic body-like cell protrusions (termed pyroptotic bodies) prior to plasma membrane rupture. The rupture in necroptosis is explosion-like, whereas in pyroptosis it leads to flattening of cells. It is known that the execution of necroptosis is mediated by mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) oligomers in the plasma membrane, whereas gasdermin-D (GSDMD) mediates pyroptosis after its cleavage by caspase-1 or caspase-11. We show that N-terminal fragment of GSDMD (GSDMD-N) generated by caspase cleavage also forms oligomer and migrates to the plasma membrane to kill cells. Both MLKL and GSDMD-N are lipophilic and the N-terminal sequences of both proteins are important for their oligomerization and plasma membrane translocation. Unlike MLKL which forms channels on the plasma membrane that induces influx of selected ions which osmotically swell the cells to burst, GSDMD-N forms non-selective pores and does not rely on increased osmolarity to disrupt cells. Our study reveals the pore-forming activity of GSDMD and channel-forming activity of MLKL determine different ways of plasma membrane rupture in pyroptosis and necroptosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2016100"
"cr","Structural insights into Ca2+-activated long-range allosteric channel gating of RyR1","Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are a class of giant ion channels with molecular mass over 2.2 mega-Daltons. These channels mediate calcium signaling in a variety of cells. Since more than 80% of the RyR protein is folded into the cytoplasmic assembly and the remaining residues form the transmembrane domain, it has been hypothesized that the activation and regulation of RyR channels occur through an as yet uncharacterized long-range allosteric mechanism. Here we report the characterization of a Ca2+-activated open-state RyR1 structure by cryo-electron microscopy. The structure has an overall resolution of 4.9 Å and a resolution of 4.2 Å for the core region. In comparison with the previously determined apo/closed-state structure, we observed long-range allosteric gating of the channel upon Ca2+ activation. In-depth structural analyses elucidated a novel channel-gating mechanism and a novel ion selectivity mechanism of RyR1. Our work not only provides structural insights into the molecular mechanisms of channel gating and regulation of RyRs, but also sheds light on structural basis for channel-gating and ion selectivity mechanisms for the six-transmembrane-helix cation channel family.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201699"
"cr","Structural basis of prokaryotic NAD-RNA decapping by NudC","In eukaryotes, the 5′,5′-triphosphate-linked 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap is essential for modulation of mRNA metabolism and protects the mRNA from degradation1. Removal of the cap from the 5′-terminus of the RNA is mainly carried out by decapping protein 2 (Dcp2)2,3 and scavenger decapping enzyme (DcpS)4. A distinctive feature of prokaryotic mRNA is the absence of a 5′-capped structure. Recently, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) or a triphosphate group has been shown to be covalently linked to the 5′-end of certain types of prokaryotic RNAs5,6 as a cap that improves stability, and NADH pyrophosphatase (NudC)6 and RNA pyrophosphohydrolase (RppH)7 are responsible for the 5′ hydrolysis of NAD or the triphosphate group, respectively, from the RNA. Interestingly, Dcp2, NudC and RppH all belong to the Nudix hydrolase superfamily, whose members act on substrates of nucleoside diphosphate linked to another moiety, X (hence the name Nudix)8. The Nudix enzymes share a conserved 23-amino acid sequence termed the Nudix motif (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU), which is required for substrate catalysis, but each uses a distinct strategy for substrate recognition. Although the molecular bases of substrate recognition by Dcp2 and RppH have been well studied9,10, the mechanism by which NudC removes the NAD cap still remains to be elucidated. Here, we report the crystal structure of Escherichia coli NudC in complex with NAD, uncovering the structural basis of NudC-mediated decapping of NAD-capped RNA.We purified recombinant NudC proteins to homogeneity and tested their NAD hydrolysis activity by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). NudC hydrolyzed NAD in the presence of Mg2+, generating nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) and adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP); however, a NudC active-site mutant (E178Q) showed almost undetectable hydrolytic activity towards NAD (Figure 1A). Thus, we used this mutant to crystallize the substrate-bound NudC complex. After numerous unsuccessful trials, we finally crystallized NAD-bound NudC (residues 1-257, E178Q) in space group P212121. On the basis of the two available coordinates of NAD-free NudC (PDB: 2GB5 and 1VK6), the structure of the NAD-NudC complex was determined by molecular replacement and refined to 2.4 Å resolution (Supplementary information, Table S1). After the assignment of most of the NudC amino acids into the electron density map, electron densities indicative of the NAD molecule were clearly visible (Supplementary information, Figure S1). In each asymmetric unit, two protein molecules bound two NAD molecules and formed a symmetric homodimer. The two NudC subunits adopt an almost identical conformation, with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.41 Å over 234 Cα atoms (Supplementary information, Figure S2A). A previously deposited NAD-free structure (PDB: 2GB5) also exists as dimer, and superposition of dimers in the NAD-free state and in the NAD-bound state generated an RMSD value of 0.46 Å over 478 Cα atoms (Supplementary information, Figure S2B), thus suggesting that NudC undergoes little conformational change upon NAD binding.Figure 1Structure of the NAD-NudC complex and recognition of NAD by NudC. (A) NudC-mediated hydrolysis of NAD was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The elution profiles of the standard samples NMN, AMP and NAD were recorded at 254 nm and are shown in the upper panel. The lower panel shows the elution profiles of NAD processed by wild-type NudC and the E178Q mutant. (B) Overall structure of the NAD-NudC complex in two perpendicular views. The NudC homodimer consists of two symmetric subunits (Mol A in green and Mol B in wheat) and resembles a butterfly with a wingspan of approximately 70 Å and a height of 60 Å. Each subunit binds one NAD molecule. NAD is shown in a yellow ball-and-stick model and is indicated by an arrow. Zinc ions are represented by gray spheres. (C) A ribbon representation of the Mol A subunit. The N-terminal domain (NTD) is colored cyan, the zinc-motif is colored bronze, the C-terminal domain (CTD) is colored green, and the Nudix motif within the CTD is colored red. The numbers under the column depict the boundaries of the motifs and domains in NudC. The labels on the helices or strands were used to trace the NudC sequence. (D) The 2Fo-Fc electron density of NAD, contoured at 1σ and shown in blue, is clearly visible in the cavity of the CTD. (E) Close-up view of the NAD binding site.

Two hydrogen bonds buttress the stacking effect. (H) The NAD hydrolysis activity of NudC and the mutants. The activity was measured by HPLC. Each experiment was independently repeated three times; average values and standard deviations are shown. (I) Model representation of formation of the NAD-NudC complex.Full size imageThe NudC structure shows a conformation of a tight symmetric homodimer with the appearance of a butterfly with a wingspan of ∼70 Å and a height of 60 Å (Figure 1B). The dimer interface, which has an area of ∼3 300 Å2, is primarily formed by polar contacts, water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and Van der Waals interactions. The interface contains 22 residues from each protomer and consists of two regions, from residues R93 to I127 and E162 to S191 (Supplementary information, Figure S3A); these residues form an extensive interaction network that is difficult to disrupt. To investigate the state of NudC in solution, we performed size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) and static light scattering (SLS) analyses. The elution profiles of NudC and the E178Q mutant in SEC suggest that the protein likely exists as a dimer (Supplementary information, Figure S3B). The AUC and SLS analyses of NudC indicated molecular masses of ∼66.3 and 63.0 kDa, respectively (Supplementary information, Figure S3C and S3D). These results are similar to the exact molecular mass of a NudC dimer (65.2 kDa) and are consistent our observations from the crystal structure.We traced the structure of NudC (Mol A, residues 1-257), consisting of an N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1-96) and a C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 128-257) separated by a zinc motif (residues 97-127; Figure 1C and Supplementary information, Figure S4). The NTD is swapped between the two NudC subunits of the homodimer, like that observed in the open conformation of apo Nudt7 of Arabidopsis thaliana11, and includes five β-strands (β1-β5), two 310-helices (η1 and η2) and one α-helix (α1). A Dali search using the NTD as a query showed that 18 of 20 retrieved structures with Z-scores higher than 5.0 were Nudix enzymes (Supplementary information, Table S2). The zinc motif, which participates in NudC dimer formation, contains two anti-parallel β-strands (β6-β7) and one zinc ion coordinated with four cysteine residues (Cys98, Cys101, Cys116, and Cys119), of which the first three are highly conserved in NudC homologs (Supplementary information, Figure S5). Consistent with this observation, mutation of any of the conserved cysteines (Cys98, Cys101, or Cys116) resulted in severe protein aggregation, suggesting that the zinc motif has an important role in maintaining the NudC structure.The CTD adopts a canonical Nudix fold with a seven-stranded mixed sheet (β8-β14) sandwiched between two remote perpendicular α-helices (α2 and α3). The conserved Nudix motif (residues 159-181) contains the catalytic residues E174, E177 and E178, which are located in a loop-helix-loop structure formed by helix α2 and the adjacent loops (Figure 1C and Supplementary information, Figure S5). Alignment of the NudC structure with the decapping enzymes RppH and Dcp2 revealed that the NudC CTD is similar to the corresponding domains of RppH and Dcp2 (Supplementary information, Figure S6A), and the Nudix motifs of the enzymes could nearly be superposed. These results suggest that the catalytic mechanism of NudC is similar to those of Dcp2 and RppH, which share a water-mediated and metal-dependent pyrophosphate hydrolysis model10,11. Despite the similarity in the overall conformation of the CTD, each of the C-terminal α-helices in these enzymes adopts different orientations, suggesting an essential role in substrate recognition (Supplementary information, Figure S6B).The NAD binding pocket in NudC is pre-organized, which was observed by comparing the surface view of NudC in the NAD-free and NAD-bound states (Supplementary information, S7A). The NAD molecule is mainly accommodated by the NudC CTD (Figure 1D), and the NAD-NudC recognition is accomplished in two major steps. First, the nicotinamide moiety is trapped in a cavity mainly comprising several bulky hydrophobic residues, including I132, W194 and M201 (Figure 1E). The amide nicotinamide group forms two hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of Q192 in β12 and the main chain of A241 in the C-terminal helix, and a subtle change in the orientation of this helix would break the latter hydrogen bond. The 3-hydroxyl group of the nicotinamide ribose interacts with S199 (Figure 1F). In a previous report, residues Q192, W194, and S199 have been found to lie within a conserved eight-amino acid motif (SQPWPFPxS), which has been used to classify NudC and other Nudix enzymes into the NADH hydrolase subfamily12, and the observed interactions here are consistent with the conservation of these residues. Second, the adenine base is stacked via π-π interactions with the benzene rings of F160 from Mol A and Y124 from Mol B (Figure 1G). Buttressing the stacking interactions with the adenine base, the 2-hydroxyl group of the adenine ribose interacts with E111 and Y124 from Mol B. These observations suggest the essential role of NudC dimerization in substrate recognition, which is reminiscent of the substrate binding mode of ADP-ribose pyrophosphatase13.We mutated the relevant residues and examined their effects on NudC-mediated NAD hydrolysis (Figure 1H) to corroborate the structural findings. As expected, a series of charged residue substitutions in the Nudix motif significantly diminished enzyme activity. The single-residue mutants I132D, W194A and M201A retained little catalytic activity, indicating that the integrity of the hydrophobic substrate-binding cavity is highly important for NAD recognition by NudC. In addition, breakage of the hydrogen bond mediated by Q192 markedly reduced the catalytic activity of NudC, and the stacking effect between residues F160/Y124 and the adenine base of NAD was also essential for substrate coordination, because F160A and Y124A mutants were nearly inactive. Neither the E111A nor the S199A mutation had a substantial effect on NudC activity, suggesting a minor role for the NAD ribose moiety in substrate-NudC recognition.Similar results were observed for the cleavage of 5′-NAD-capped RNA by NudC; the substrate was cleaved into NMN and monophosphorylated RNA (Supplementary information, Figure S7B). As anticipated, most of the alanine substitutions in residues responsible for NAD recognition, such as Y124, I132, F160, W194, and M201, and key residues that participate in catalysis, such as E165, R173, E174, E178, and E219, significantly diminished the cleavage of NAD-capped RNA (Supplementary information, Figure 7C). In addition, the E177A and Q192A mutants exhibited half of the wild-type activity. Altogether, these results suggest that RNA recognition by NudC occurs mainly through binding with the NAD moiety. Intriguingly, most of the residues involved in NAD recognition are highly conserved in NudC homologs ranging from E. coli to human (Supplementary information, Figure S5). Given the prevalence of NAD in the three kingdoms, the NAD capping/decapping processes for RNA might be evolutionarily conserved. To examine this possibility we investigated the ability of several NudC homologs to cleave NAD-capped RNA. NPY1 and Nudt19, the NudC homologs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Oryza sativa, respectively, hydrolyzed the substrate into NMN and monophosphorylated RNA in vitro (Supplementary information, Figure S7D). Although further investigation is required, these results raise the possibility that NAD-mediated RNA processing might be a universal mechanism that also operates in higher eukaryotic species. A recent finding that both bacterial RNAP and eukaryotic RNAP II show the ability of incorporating the NAD cap into RNA14 corroborates our speculation.The RNA decapping process is precisely regulated in vivo, as exemplified by the Dcp1p-regulated hydrolytic activity of Dcp2p on m7G-capped RNA2 and the DapF-regulated pyrophosphatase activity of RppH15. A structural investigation showed that Dcp1p binds to the NTD of Dcp2p and stimulates its activity2. These findings raise the possibility that the decapping activity of NudC may also be regulated by other factors through interaction with the NTD.In summary, our data not only reveal the molecular basis of NAD-capped RNA recognition by the NudC dimer (Figure 1I) but also provide the framework for further functional identification of regulatory factors involved in the RNA decapping process. The architecture of the NAD-NudC complex also provides a structural explanation for the conservation of residues that might participate in recognition of NAD and NAD-capped RNA in organisms ranging from E. coli to human. Moreover, the ability of the two examined NudC eukaryotic homologs to cleave NAD-capped RNAs suggests that the process of removing the NAD-cap from the 5′-terminus of RNA is evolutionarily conserved.The atomic coordinates and structure factors for the structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the accession code 5ISY.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201698"
"cr","TALEN-based generation of a cynomolgus monkey disease model for human microcephaly","Gene editing in non-human primates may lead to valuable models for exploring the etiologies and therapeutic strategies of genetically based neurological disorders in humans. However, a monkey model of neurological disorders that closely mimics pathological and behavioral deficits in humans has not yet been successfully generated. Microcephalin 1 (MCPH1) is implicated in the evolution of the human brain, and MCPH1 mutation causes microcephaly accompanied by mental retardation. Here we generated a cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) carrying biallelic MCPH1 mutations using transcription activator-like effector nucleases. The monkey recapitulated most of the important clinical features observed in patients, including marked reductions in head circumference, premature chromosome condensation (PCC), hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and upper limb spasticity. Moreover, overexpression of MCPH1 in mutated dermal fibroblasts rescued the PCC syndrome. This monkey model may help us elucidate the role of MCPH1 in the pathogenesis of human microcephaly and better understand the function of this protein in the evolution of primate brain size.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201693"
"cr","The Central domain of RyR1 is the transducer for long-range allosteric gating of channel opening","The ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are intracellular calcium channels responsible for rapid release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) to the cytoplasm, which is essential for the excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling of cardiac and skeletal muscles. The near-atomic resolution structure of closed RyR1 revealed the molecular details of this colossal channel, while the long-range allosteric gating mechanism awaits elucidation. Here, we report the cryo-EM structures of rabbit RyR1 in three closed conformations at about 4 Å resolution and an open state at 5.7 Å. Comparison of the closed RyR1 structures shows a breathing motion of the cytoplasmic platform, while the channel domain and its contiguous Central domain remain nearly unchanged. Comparison of the open and closed structures shows a dilation of the S6 tetrahelical bundle at the cytoplasmic gate that leads to channel opening. During the pore opening, the cytoplasmic “O-ring” motif of the channel domain and the U-motif of the Central domain exhibit coupled motion, while the Central domain undergoes domain-wise displacement. These structural analyses provide important insight into the E-C coupling in skeletal muscles and identify the Central domain as the transducer that couples the conformational changes of the cytoplasmic platform to the gating of the central pore.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201689"

"cr","Distribution of IgG galactosylation as a promising biomarker for cancer screening in multiple cancer types","Cancer is prevalent worldwide. Currently, most routinely used non-invasive serological cancer biomarkers, including carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), α-fetoprotein (AFP), CA125, CA15-3, and CA19-9, suffer from low specificity and/or low sensitivity1. Improvements in timely and effective diagnosis of cancer are urgently needed. Most serum proteins are glycosylated, and deregulation of glycosylation has been reported to be associated with a wide range of diseases including cancer2. Thus, analysis of blood-based glycans represents a new strategy for cancer diagnosis2. Immunoglobin G (IgG), a highly abundant glycoprotein in serum, is known to mediate a variety of blood immune responses. There has been an increasing interest in the analysis of the N-glycan profile of human IgG in healthy and disease states, such as autoimmune diseases and cancer3. Several studies recently showed that the glycosylation profiles of total serum IgG exhibited significant differences between non-malignant controls and cancer patients, such as gastric, liver and ovarian cancers4,5,6,7. We have previously demonstrated significant decrease in serum level of terminally galactosylated N-glycans of IgG in 32 patients with ovarian cancer compared with 26 patients with benign gynecological conditions7. Although altered glycosylation of total serum IgG has been profiled individually in ovarian, prostate, gastric, lung, and liver cancers7,8, no studies have systematically investigated the alteration of IgG glycosylation in multiple cancers simultaneously. In addition, the sample sizes in previous studies were limited.In this study, we performed for the first time a large-scale, multi-institute study to assess the quantitative changes of IgG glycosylation in 12 types of cancers and non-malignant controls. The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether serum IgG glycosylation patterns have similar alterations in multiple types of cancer and whether alteration in IgG galactosylation profiles can serve as a pan-cancer biomarker for cancer screening.To this end, quantitative changes of serum IgG glycosylation were assessed by mass spectrometry (MS) based on the method described previously7. The detailed methods and statistical analysis were listed in Supplementary information, Data S1. In the discovery stage, we compared the serum IgG glycosylation patterns between healthy individuals and patients with gastric, liver, lung or ovarian cancer. IgG-derived glycans in each sample were assessed by MS, which detected various glycoforms of IgG, such as terminal galactose, core fucose and bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc; Supplementary information, Figure S1A). Comparison of various types of IgG glycosylation between controls and cancer patients showed that only the difference in IgG galactosylation distribution passed the statistical criteria (P < 0.05) and achieved a high area under the curve (AUC) score in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) test (AUC > 0.8) in each cancer type (Supplementary information, Table S1C). Thus, IgG galactosylation was selected as the candidate pan-cancer biomarker for further screening. The distribution of IgG galactosylation (referred to as Gal-ratio) was measured by calculating the relative intensities of agalactosylated (G0) vs monogalactosyl (G1) and digalactosyl (G2) N-glycans according to the formula of G0/(G1 + G2 × 2)7. The performance of the IgG Gal-ratio in cancer diagnosis was first evaluated in a small-size test cohort and then validated in an independent large-size cohort.Participants in the test cohort were recruited from one hospital between September 2013 and April 2014 and include 114 non-cancer controls and 580 cancer patients, covering 12 types of cancers (gastric, liver, lung, ovarian, colorectal, esophageal, pancreatic, renal, prostate, bladder, breast and cervical cancers; 30-50 samples/cancer type). The Gal-ratios were significantly higher in all cancer patients (median 0.6373, IQR 0.4878-0.8817, mean 0.7445, SD 0.01745) than controls (median 0.3651, IQR 0.2898-0.4401, mean 0.3841, SD 0.01746; P < 0.0001) in the test cohort (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). The validation cohort comprises 5 704 participants recruited from three hospitals between September 2013 and March 2016, including 4 685 individuals with cancers consisting of the above 12 types, 747 healthy controls, and 272 individuals with non-malignant diseases including chronic hepatitis B (CHB), chronic inflammation and benign tumors. Clinicopathological characteristics of all participants were summarized in Supplementary information, Table S1A and S1B. Consistently, cancer patients showed higher Gal-ratios (median 0.6498, IQR 0.4859-0.8993, mean 0.7482, SD 0.006120) compared with non-cancer controls (median 0.3542, IQR 0.2789-0.4369; mean 0.3784, SD 0.004978; P < 0.0001) in the validation cohort (Figure 1A).Figure 1(A) Comparison of IgG Gal-ratio values of serum samples obtained from non-cancer controls and cancer patients in the validation cohort. (B) ROC curve for IgG Gal-ratio to distinguish cancer patients from non-cancer controls in the validation cohort. (C) Performance of IgG Gal-ratio in the detection of individual cancer types in the validation cohort.

(G) Comparison of Gal-ratio values in serum samples obtained from patients with ovarian cancer and those with inflammatory gynecological diseases (a). ROC curve for IgG Gal-ratio to distinguish patients with ovarian cancer from those with inflammatory gynecological diseases (b).Full size imageNext the ROC curve was used to evaluate the performance of IgG Gal-ratio in cancer diagnosis. AUC of the Gal-ratio is 0.871 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.879, 0.903) with sensitivity of 79.0% and specificity of 85.1% in the test cohort (Supplementary information, Figure S1C and Table S1E), and is 0.862 (95% CI: 0.712, 0.988) with sensitivity of 77.8% and specificity of 83.0% in the validation cohort (Figure 1B and Supplementary information, Table S1F). Similar result was obtained (AUC = 0.887) when comparing patients with cancer to those with non-malignant diseases. Participants were then classified into three subgroups based on age, each with a 1:1 male-to-female ratio. Performance of IgG Gal-ratio in three subgroups was further evaluated. Although the age, to some extent, has an influence on the values of Gal-ratio, the Gal-ratios of cancer patients were still consistently higher than those of controls in each subgroup (Supplementary information, Table S1D), indicating that the influence of age on IgG galactosylation is unlikely to cause the considerable difference in the Gal-ratios between cancer patients and controls.Meanwhile, we assessed the diagnostic performance of IgG Gal-ratio analysis in individual cancer. As compared with the controls, the Gal-ratios were found to be consistently significantly higher in each cancer type. ROC analyses demonstrated that the Gal-ratio yielded high AUCs for each of the 12 cancer types, ranging from 0.688 to 0.942, in the test cohort (Supplementary information, Figure S1D and Table S1E). Notably, the AUCs were > 0.9 in seven types of cancer, including cancers with the highest mortality in China (lung, liver, esophageal and colorectal cancers). Thus, the Gal-ratio of total serum IgG exhibited a common feature among all the 12 types of cancer and showed great potential in cancer diagnosis. In the validation cohort, the Gal-ratio showed similar performance to that achieved in the test cohort, with AUCs of 0.667-0.930 for the 12 types of cancer (Figure 1C and Supplementary information, Table S1F), verifying that the IgG Gal-ratio exhibited a common feature across the 12 types of cancer and thus represents a promising pan-cancer biomarker. Additionally, the false positive rate and positive and negative predictive values of the Gal-ratio in the test and validation cohorts for each cancer type were listed in Supplementary information, Table S1G.Considering the accuracy of diagnosis, IgG Gal-ratio showed better performance than classical biomarkers. In the test cohort, the Gal-ratio had greater AUC and higher sensitivity at the same specificity than all classical biomarkers when detecting the corresponding individual cancer. For example, AUCs were 0.942 vs 0.750 and sensitivities were 84.0% vs 61.2% at the same specificity for the Gal-ratio vs AFP in detection of liver cancer (Supplementary information, Figure S1E and Table S1E). The performance was further improved when Gal-ratio and classical biomarkers were combined (Supplementary information, Figure S1E and Table S1E). These findings were also verified in the validation cohort (Figure 1D and Supplementary information, Table S1F).Of note, the positive rate of the Gal-ratio biomarker is higher than that of classical biomarkers in individual cancer type in the test cohort (Supplementary information, Figure S1F). For example, the positive rates of Gal-ratio and AFP in liver cancer are 84.0% and 58.0%, respectively. Additionally, most classical biomarker-negative cases of cancer were positive for the Gal-ratio, such as Gal-ratio positive rates of 85.7%, 77.3%, 90.0% for AFP-, CEA- and PSA-negative cases, respectively (Supplementary information, Figure S1F). The positive rates for the Gal-ratio marker were similar between classical biomarker-positive and -negative patients (Supplementary information, Figure S1F). These data suggest that the diagnosis potential of the Gal-ratio marker is independent of classical biomarker statuses. In addition, the validation cohort confirmed the potential of Gal-ratio as a cancer biomarker independent of classical biomarker statuses (Figure 1E).Furthermore, we evaluated whether the IgG Gal-ratio holds potential to identify early-stage cancers. In the present study, tumors of stage I were taken as early-stage cancers. The Gal-ratios were significantly different between stage I cancer patients (n = 113) and controls in the test cohort. The AUC of Gal-ratio was 0.864 (95%CI: 0.817-0.910) with the sensitivity of 78.8% and specificity of 85.1% (Supplementary information, Figure S1G and Table S1E). When comparing stage I patients (n = 511) and controls in the validation cohort, we found that the Gal-ratio had similar diagnostic accuracy to that in the test cohort with an AUC of 0.848 (95% CI: 0.827-0.868) with the sensitivity of 75.0% and specificity of 82.5% (Figure 1F and Supplementary information, Table S1F). Similarly, the AUC of Gal-ratio was 0.857 (95% CI: 0.834-0.880) with the sensitivity of 76.3% and the specificity of 82.5% when cancer patients who had only a tumor of ≤ 2 cm compared to controls in the validation cohort. Thus, Gal-ratio may also be used for the diagnosis of early-stage cancers.In addition, we assessed whether IgG Gal-ratio can distinguish between cancer and inflammation diseases. Previous reports have provided evidence linking ovarian cancer with some inflammatory gynecological diseases, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome9. CA125, a routinely used cancer biomarker for ovarian cancer, is usually also elevated in these inflammatory diseases, leading to high incidence of false-positive results. Here, we found that the IgG Gal-ratios were significantly higher in patients with ovarian cancer (median 0.7360, IQR 0.5274-1.062, mean 0.8765, SD 0.02638) compared with those with inflammatory gynecological diseases (median 0.3236, IQR 0.2603-0.3932, mean 0.3594, SD 0.01592; P < 0.0001) (Figure 1Ga). ROC analysis yielded AUC of 0.916 (95% CI: 0.884, 0.949) for the IgG Gal-ratio (Figure 1Gb). These results indicate a great performance of IgG Gal-ratio in discrimination between patients with ovarian cancer and those with inflammatory gynecological diseases. Similarly, compared with CHB (n = 35; median 0.4480, IQR 0.3306-0.6191, mean 0.4831, SD 0.03644), the Gal-ratios were significantly higher in liver cancer (n = 521; median 0.7648, IQR 0.5885-1.100, mean 0.9172, SD 0.02390; P < 0.0001) (Supplementary information, Figure S2A). IgG Gal-ratio showed accurate results in distinguishing patients with liver cancer from those with CHB (AUC 0.833 (95% CI: 0.765-0.901); Supplementary information, Figure S2A). Similar performance of IgG Gal-ratio was also observed between patients with gastric cancer (n = 1 049) and patients with gastric inflammation diseases (n = 11). IgG Gal-ratio had an AUC of 0.873 (95% CI: 0.797, 0.949; Supplementary information, Figure S2B). The diagnostic potential of IgG Gal-ratio in discrimination between other types of cancer and inflammatory diseases needs to be further investigated in the future.Change of IgG galactosylation was first reported in rheumatoid arthritis3 and later also reported in other autoimmune diseases, such as psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis10. Most of autoimmune diseases have their own characteristic symptoms and diagnostic methods, enabling discrimination from cancers. However, it is interesting that similar alterations of IgG glycosylation were observed in both autoimmune disease and cancer. Some studies have suggested possible mechanism for the change of IgG galactosylation in these diseases, such as downregulated galactosyltransferase activity in plasma cells11 or host-defense response to the presence of the tumor6. The potential role of changes of IgG galactosylation in cancer development and progression is worthy of further in-depth investigation.In summary, we report for the first time that the Gal-ratio of IgG exhibits a common feature in multiple cancer types in two independent cohorts by assessing distribution patterns of IgG galactosylation in 12 types of cancers using large-size samples collected from multiple hospitals. Analysis of IgG Gal-ratio could distinguish these 12 types of cancers from non-cancer controls. Similar result was obtained when IgG Gal-ratio was used to distinguish early-stage cancers from non-cancer controls. All the results indicate that the distribution of IgG galactosylation has great potential to be used as a non-invasive pan-cancer biomarker for early-stage cancer detection and cancer screening.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201683"
"cr","Identification of blood vascular endothelial stem cells by the expression of protein C receptor","Vascular growth and remodeling are dependent on the generation of new endothelial cells from stem cells and the involvement of perivascular cells to maintain vessel integrity and function. The existence and cellular identity of vascular endothelial stem cells (VESCs) remain unclear. The perivascular pericytes in adult tissues are thought to arise from the recruitment and differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors during early development. In this study, we identified Protein C receptor-expressing (Procr+) endothelial cells as VESCs in multiple tissues. Procr+ VESCs exhibit robust clonogenicity in culture, high vessel reconstitution efficiency in transplantation, long-term clonal expansion in lineage tracing, and EndMT characteristics. Moreover, Procr+ VESCs are bipotent, giving rise to de novo formation of endothelial cells and pericytes. This represents a novel origin of pericytes in adult angiogenesis, reshaping our understanding of blood vessel development and homeostatic process. Our study may also provide a more precise therapeutic target to inhibit pathological angiogenesis and tumor growth.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201685"
"cr","Structural basis for blocking PD-1-mediated immune suppression by therapeutic antibody pembrolizumab","PD-1 is a type I immune inhibitory transmembrane receptor of the CD28 family that modulates the activity of T cells in peripheral tissues1. It is expressed in T cells, B cells, monocytes, natural killer cells and many tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes2. Binding of PD-1 to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 reduces T-cell activity3. Thereby, under normal conditions, the interaction of PD-1 with PD-L1 or PD-L2 prevents excessive lymphocyte activation and maintains immune tolerance to self-antigens by negatively regulating the immune response3. However, PD-L1 is often overexpressed in different tumors including lymphoma, melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer and other types of cancer2. As a result, tumor cells attenuate T-cell signaling to evade immune surveillance4. Blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction has been shown to restore T-cell activation and antitumor response, providing the rationale for therapeutic intervention using PD-1/PD-L1 as target5. Currently two monoclonal antibody-based drugs targeting PD-1 are in clinical trials. One is nivolumab or Opdivo from Bristol-Myers Squibb. The other is pembrolizumab or Keytruda, a therapeutic IgG4 antibody developed by Merck.Crystal structures of mouse PD-1 (mPD-1) in complex with human PD-L1 (hPD-L1), mPD-1 complexed with mouse PD-L2 (mPD-L2) and human PD-1 (hPD-1) in complex with hPD-L1 have revealed the structural basis of PD-1's interaction with its ligands6,7,8. Crystal structure of the full-length pembrolizumab was also reported recently9. However, how pembrolizumab specifically recognizes hPD-1 is still unknown. Herein, we report the crystal structure of pembrolizumab Fab (antigen-binding fragment) in complex with hPD-1, revealing the molecular basis for the blockade of hPD-1/hPD-L1 interaction by pembrolizumab.Crystal structure of the hPD-1/pembrolizumab Fab complex (hPD-1/Fab) was determined at a resolution of 2.9 Å (Supplementary information, Table S1). hPD-1 and pembrolizumab Fab form a 1:1 complex (Figure 1A), consistent with the stoichiometry determined by previous results10. hPD-1 is made up of a canonical β-sandwich immunoglobulin variable (IgV) topology with a disulfide bond between Cys54 and Cys123. Structural comparison of hPD-1 with apo-hPD-1 (PDB: 3RRQ) and hPD-1 structure extracted from the hPD-1/hPD-L1 complex (PDB: 4ZQK) shows that hPD-1 in the hPD-1/Fab complex resembles the conformation observed in the hPD-1/hPD-L1 complex. The pembrolizumab Fab in the complex exhibits a canonical β-sandwich immunoglobulin fold closely resembling the full-length pembrolizumab antibody (Supplementary information, Figure S1)9.Figure 1Structural basis for the blockade of hPD-1/hPD-L1 interaction by pembrolizumab. (A) Overall structure of the hPD-1/pembrolizumab Fab complex. hPD-1 is shown in light blue, and the light and heavy chains of Fab are in wheat and pale green, respectively.

(E) ELISA data showing the binding of pembrolizumab to hPD-1 or hPD-1 mutants, and mPD-1. (F) Superposition of the hPD-1/pembrolizumab Fab complex with hPD-1/hPD-L1. hPD-L1 is shown in magenta. For simplicity, only hPD-1 in hPD-1/pembrolizumab Fab is shown in light blue.Full size imageThe interaction of PD-1 with pembrolizumab Fab buries ∼1 774 Å2 surface area, and the hPD-1/Fab interface can be divided into two sub-interfaces. Sub-interface I mainly encompasses the C′D loop of hPD-1 and pembrolizumab Fab's complementary determining regions (CDRs) L1, L3, H2 and four β-strands of framework region (FR), which interact through polar, charged and hydrophobic contacts (Figure 1B). The most notable feature of this sub-interface is that the C′D loop of hPD-1 protrudes into a groove formed by the CDRs and FR of pembrolizumab Fab. Specifically, Asp85 of hPD-1 establishes a salt bridge with ArgH99 of FR (hereafter residues of the Fab light chain and heavy chain are designated by superscript chain identifiers L and H, respectively). The side chain of Ser87 forms hydrogen bond with ArgH99 of FR. Interestingly, two arginines Arg86 and ArgL96 are involved in a T-shaped stacking interaction. The backbone of C′D loop residues Glu84, Ser87, Gln88 and Gly90 are held in place by hydrogen bonds with side chains of TyrL36, TyrH35, AsnH59 and ThrH58, respectively. Furthermore, Pro89 of hPD-1 inserts into a cavity formed by side chains of TyrH33, TyrH35, AsnH52 and AsnH59 of β-stands 1, 2 and 3, and the main chains of GlyH50, IleH51, GlyH57 and ThrH58 of β-stands 1 and 2.Sub-interface II is dominated by hydrophilic interactions and brings together residues in the C, C′ and F strands of hPD-1 and CDRs L1 and H3 of Fab (Figure 1C). The side chains of Asn66 and Lys78 of hPD-1 form hydrogen bonds with the backbone groups of ArgH102 and TyrH101, respectively. The side chain of Thr76 of hPD-1 is hydrogen bonded to the side chain of TyrH101. In addition, PheH103 of CDR H3 inserts into a hydrophobic pocket formed by Val64 and Pro83 of hPD-1 and TyrL34 of CDR L1.The extensive interactions at the hPD-1/Fab interface are consistent with the high binding affinity of pembrolizumab to the hPD-1, with an apparent disassociation constant (KD) of 27 pM. In the previously published hPD-1 structures (PDB: 3RRQ and 4ZQK), the C′D loop of hPD-1 is disordered and is assumed to be highly flexible8,10. However, the C′D loop of hPD-1 in our hPD-1/Fab complex structure is well ordered, as evidenced by its well-defined electron density, and it contributes to sub-interface I with Fab. Although mPD-1 and hPD-1 share 60% sequence identity and an IgV topology, hPD-1 lacks the additional C″ strand observed in mPD-1 (Figure 1D). Moreover, Asp85 and Arg86 in hPD-1 are substituted by Gly85 and Leu86 in mPD-1, respectively. Mutations in hPD-1, D85G and R86L show significant differences in their binding affinities with pembrolizumab. D85G abolishes hPD-1 binding to pembrolizumab as determined by ELISA (Figure 1E). This can be attributed to the disruption of the salt bridge with ArgH99 of Fab, which can conceivably impair the PD-1/Fab complex assembly. However, R86L did not affect the binding affinity between hPD-1 and pembrolizumab. These results are consistent with earlier data showing that pembrolizumab displays low binding affinity toward mPD-1 (Patent: WC500190992).Structural superposition of the hPD-1/pembrolizumab Fab complex and the hPD-1/hPD-L1 complex shows that pembrolizumab Fab and hPD-L1 interact with hPD-1 through overlapping surface regions, suggesting that pembrolizumab and hPD-L1 can exclude each other from binding to hPD-1 (Figure 1F). Although the C′D loop in the sub-interface I contributes predominantly to the binding affinity of permbrolizumab, the C′D loop is disordered in the hPD-1/hPD-L1 complex, suggesting that it is not important for the hPD-1/hPD-L1 interaction. Consistent with this observation, the overlapping regions are mainly located in the sub-interface II, where the antigen-binding site of permbrolizumab Fab largely overlaps with the regions of hPD-L1 that interact with hPD-1.A second ligand for PD-1 is PD-L2, which shares 34% sequence identity with PD-L1 and exhibits 3-fold higher binding affinity for PD-17. Given that mPD-L2 and hPD-L2 share a sequence identity of 72%, we modeled the hPD-1/hPD-L2 complex based on the structures of hPD-1/hPD-L1 and mPD-1/mPD-L2. Structural superposition of hPD-1/pembrolizumab Fab complex and modeled hPD-1/hPD-L2 complex suggest that pembrolizumab Fab would also compete with hPD-L2 for binding to hPD-1 (Supplementary information, Figure S2) through overlapping regions similar to those observed between hPD-1/pembrolizumab Fab and hPD-1/hPD-L1. Taken together, these observations suggest a mechanism by which pembrolizumab outcompetes PD-L1 or PD-L2 for binding to hPD-1.In summary, we have reported the crystal structure of the pembrolizumab Fab in complex with the ectodomain of hPD-1. Pembrolizumab Fab uses its CDRs and FR to interact with the C′D loop of hPD-1, which appears unstructured in previously published reports. The epitope consists of several discontinuous segments of hPD-1, which overlap with the region that interacts with hPD-L1 or hPD-L2, suggesting a mechanism by which pembrolizumab prevents the binding of hPD-L1 or hPD-L2 to hPD-1. These results have implications for the design and improvement of mAb drugs targeting hPD-1.The atomic coordinates and structure factors for hPD-1/pembrolizumab Fab complex structure have been deposited into Protein Data Bank under the accession code of 5JXE.

"cr","Ligand stimulation of CD95 induces activation of Plk3 followed by phosphorylation of caspase-8","Upon interaction of the CD95 receptor with its ligand, sequential association of the adaptor molecule FADD (MORT1), pro-forms of caspases-8/10, and the caspase-8/10 regulator c-FLIP leads to the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex. Here, we identify polo-like kinase (Plk) 3 as a new interaction partner of the death receptor CD95. The enzymatic activity of Plk3 increases following interaction of the CD95 receptor with its ligand. Knockout (KO) or knockdown of caspase-8, CD95 or FADD prevents activation of Plk3 upon CD95 stimulation, suggesting a requirement of a functional DISC for Plk3 activation. Furthermore, we identify caspase-8 as a new substrate for Plk3. Phosphorylation occurs on T273 and results in stimulation of caspase-8 proapoptotic function. Stimulation of CD95 in cells expressing a non-phosphorylatable caspase-8-T273A mutant in a rescue experiment or in Plk3-KO cells generated by CRISPR/Cas9 reduces the processing of caspase-8 prominently. Low T273 phosphorylation correlates significantly with low Plk3 expression in a cohort of 95 anal tumor patients. Our data suggest a novel mechanism of kinase activation within the Plk family and propose a new model for the stimulation of the extrinsic death pathway in tumors with high Plk3 expression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201678"
"cr","MutSβ promotes trinucleotide repeat expansion by recruiting DNA polymerase β to nascent (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins for error-prone DNA synthesis","Expansion of (CAG)•(CTG) repeats causes a number of familial neurodegenerative disorders. Although the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown, components involved in DNA mismatch repair, particularly mismatch recognition protein MutSβ (a MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer), are implicated in (CAG)•(CTG) repeat expansion. In addition to recognizing small insertion-deletion loop-outs, MutSβ also specifically binds DNA hairpin imperfect heteroduplexes formed within (CAG)n•(CTG)n sequences. However, whether or not and how MutSβ binding triggers expansion of (CAG)•(CTG) repeats remain unknown. We show here that purified recombinant MutSβ physically interacts with DNA polymerase β (Polβ) and stimulates Polβ-catalyzed (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpin retention. Consistent with these in vitro observations, MutSβ and Polβ interact with each other in vivo, and colocalize at (CAG)•(CTG) repeats during DNA replication. Our data support a model for error-prone processing of (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins by MutSβ and Polβ during DNA replication and/or repair: MutSβ recognizes (CAG)n or (CTG)n hairpins formed in the nascent DNA strand, and recruits Polβ to the complex, which then utilizes the hairpin as a primer for extension, leading to (CAG)•(CTG) repeat expansion. This study provides a novel mechanism for trinucleotide repeat expansion in both dividing and non-dividing cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201666"
"cr","RANKL/RANK control Brca1 mutation-driven mammary tumors","Breast cancer is the most common female cancer, affecting approximately one in eight women during their life-time. Besides environmental triggers and hormones, inherited mutations in the breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) or BRCA2 genes markedly increase the risk for the development of breast cancer. Here, using two different mouse models, we show that genetic inactivation of the key osteoclast differentiation factor RANK in the mammary epithelium markedly delayed onset, reduced incidence, and attenuated progression of Brca1;p53 mutation-driven mammary cancer. Long-term pharmacological inhibition of the RANK ligand RANKL in mice abolished the occurrence of Brca1 mutation-driven pre-neoplastic lesions. Mechanistically, genetic inactivation of Rank or RANKL/RANK blockade impaired proliferation and expansion of both murine Brca1;p53 mutant mammary stem cells and mammary progenitors from human BRCA1 mutation carriers. In addition, genome variations within the RANK locus were significantly associated with risk of developing breast cancer in women with BRCA1 mutations. Thus, RANKL/RANK control progenitor cell expansion and tumorigenesis in inherited breast cancer. These results present a viable strategy for the possible prevention of breast cancer in BRCA1 mutant patients.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201669"
"cr","Vertical transmission of Zika virus targeting the radial glial cells affects cortex development of offspring mice","The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Latin America coincided with a marked increase in microcephaly in newborns. However, the causal link between maternal ZIKV infection and malformation of the fetal brain has not been firmly established. Here we show a vertical transmission of ZIKV in mice and a marked effect on fetal brain development. We found that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of a contemporary ZIKV strain in pregnant mice led to the infection of radial glia cells (RGs) of dorsal ventricular zone of the fetuses, the primary neural progenitors responsible for cortex development, and caused a marked reduction of these cortex founder cells in the fetuses. Interestingly, the infected fetal mice exhibited a reduced cavity of lateral ventricles and a discernable decrease in surface areas of the cortex. This study thus supports the conclusion that vertically transmitted ZIKV affects fetal brain development and provides a valuable animal model for the evaluation of potential therapeutic or preventative strategies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201658"
"cr","YEATS2 is a selective histone crotonylation reader","Histone lysine crotonylation (Kcr) is a recently identified non-acetyl acylation conserved from yeast to human. We have previously shown that histone Kcr marked active chromatin and was enriched at promoter and enhancer regions1. Different from the histone lysine acetylation (Kac), histone Kcr preferentially marks “escapee genes” during post-meiotic gene inactivation, suggesting a unique regulatory mechanism centered on Kcr independent of Kac2. Nevertheless, in contrast to the histone Kac readers that are well documented, selective readers for histone Kcr remain unknown. Although a few bromodomain-containing proteins (e.g., TAF1) were shown to recognize Kcr, their binding affinities are much compromised as compared to Kac binding3.YEATS2 is a YEATS domain-containing protein conserved from fly to human (Figure 1A). It is a stoichiometric subunit of the ADA Two A-Containing (ATAC) histone acetyltransferase complex involved in transcription regulation, stress signaling and mitotic progression4,5,6,7. Previously, we identified the YEATS domain as a histone Kac reader module8. Given the structural similarity between the acetyl and the crotonyl groups amongst other acylation types (Figure 1B), we explored the binding of recombinant YEATS2 YEATS domain to histone peptides modified by different acyl groups using a modified histone peptide array. We found that YEATS2 bound to a repertoire of acylated histone peptides with the best preference for histone H3 with crotonylation on lysine 27 (H3K27cr) in the peptide array bearing 64 reported histone acylations (Figure 1C and Supplementary information, Figure S1).Figure 1The YEATS domain of YEATS2 is a selective reader of H3K27cr.

S230 of YEATS2 is indicated with a red arrowhead.Full size imageTo quantify the binding property of YEATS2 towards histone peptides bearing different acylations, we performed Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) using synthetic histone peptides. We tested various acylations on H3K27, including formylation (fo), acetylation (ac), propionylation (pr), butyrylation (bu), crotonylation (cr), and 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation (hib), and used trimethylation (me3) as a negative control. Calorimetric titrations revealed that the YEATS domain of YEATS2 bound to H31-34 peptides with acylations on K27 in a preference order of K27cr (31.7 μM) > K27bu (123.6 μM) > K27hib (141.4 μM) > K27pr (148.4 μM) > K27ac (226.2 μM) > K27fo (N.D.) and K27me3 (N.D.) (KD values are shown in parenthesis, N.D., not detected; Figure 1D). This suggests that YEATS2 favors acyl groups harboring longer hydrocarbon chains with the best selectivity for Kcr that discriminates against Kac by approximately 7-fold. To further validate site specificity, we synthesized peptides bearing crotonyl modifications at H3 K4, K9, K14, K23, K27, or H4 K12. Calorimetric titration revealed that the YEATS domain of YEATS2 bound to H315-39 K27cr with the strongest affinity (KD = 27.5 μM), and showed compromised binding activities towards H41-15K12cr (KD = 62.0 μM), H31-15K4cr (KD = 121.4 μM), H31-25K23cr (KD = 172.4 μM) and H31-15K9cr (KD = 341.3 μM). No binding was observed for H31-25K14cr, and the adjacent S28 phosphorylation (S28ph) reduced H315-39K27cr binding by 5-fold (Figure 1E). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the YEATS domain of YEATS2 is a selective reader for H3K27cr.To explore the molecular basis for H3K27cr recognition by YEATS2, we determined the complex structure of the YEATS domain (aa 201-332) of human YEATS2 bound to H324-31K27cr peptide at 2.1 Å (Supplementary information, Table S1). The overall structure of the YEATS domain adopts an immunoglobin β-sandwich fold (Figure 1F, left). Based on the electron densities, we could clearly trace the H3 fragment, “A24-A25-R26-K27cr-S28-A29-P30-A31”, with the Kcr group clamped by Y262 and W282 (Figure 1F, left and middle). The H3K27cr peptide is snugly stapled into the YEATS domain with a buried solvent accessible surface area of 636 Å2. The histone peptide-binding surface of YEATS2 is less negative compared to that of AF98 due to surrounding positively charged patches (Figure 1F, right), which may partly account for the relatively weak histone binding activity observed for YEATS2. Another striking difference of H3 peptide recognition between YEATS2 and AF9 is the opposite orientation of the peptides. In the complex structure of AF9-H3K9ac8, the N-terminal motif “K4-Q5-T6-A7-R8” of H3 participates in AF9 binding (Figure 1G, top panel). However, in the complex structure of YEATS2-H3K27cr, the C-terminal motif “S28-A29-P30-A31” of H3 contributes to binding (Figure 1G, middle panel). Notably, the H3P30 inserts into a hydrophobic pocket of YEATS2 (termed P30 pocket), facilitating the positioning of H3K27cr (Supplementary information, Figure S2A). The recognition of a C-terminal sequence (+1 to +4) signature by YEATS2 partly explains its site specificity towards H3K27cr but not H3K9cr (Figure 1E) because sequences around H3K9 and H3K27 sites share a consensus “A(-2)R(-1)KS(+1)” motif, yet are divergent in flanking regions (Figure 1G, bottom). The H324-31K27cr peptide binding is notably stabilized by a hydrogen bonding network involving residues H259, S261, Y262, W282, G283, E284, F285, and Y313 of YEATS2 (Figure 1H and Supplementary information, Figure S2B). The four-carbon crotonylamide group is planar due to π-electron conjugation1. H3K27cr adopts a trans-configuration and is notably recognized by π-aromatic stacking interactions within an aromatic sandwich cage formed by Y262 and W282 (Figure 1F, middle and Figure 1H). Besides, the amide group of K27cr is further recognized by relayed hydrogen bonding interactions involving residues S261 and W282 of YEATS2 (Figure 1H and Supplementary information, Figure S2B). Such acyl amide recognition accounts for the preference of YEATS2 for lysine acylation but not methylation. The ∼4-fold affinity drop in the case of Kbu versus Kcr (Figure 1D) underscores the importance of π-aromatic interactions originated from an alkenyl feature of the crotonyl group.To validate the crucial residues of YEATS2 for H3K27cr peptide recognition, we next performed structure-based mutagenesis studies. ITC titrations revealed that mutations of sandwich pocket residues (Y262A, W282A and F285A) and residues forming hydrogen bonds around H3K27cr (H259A and S261A) significantly weaken the interaction, highlighting their importance (Figure 1I). G283 is part of the inner wall of the K27cr-binding pocket. The complete binding loss of the G283A mutant (Figure 1I) suggests the necessity of a side chain-free G283 for proper Kcr insertion (Figure 1H). A 2.3-fold binding drop of Y313A (Figure 1I) validates a role of Y313 in H3A31 interaction (Figure 1H). The complete binding loss of E284A (Figure 1I) suggests a key role of E284 in both S28 recognition and P30 pocket formation (Figure 1H and Supplementary information, Figure S2A). Of note, the acidic feature of E284 likely explains the sensitivity of the YEATS2-H3K27cr interaction to S28ph (Figure 1E), considering the effect of charge repulsion caused by S28ph. However, this observation contrasts with the reported H3S10ph tolerance by AF9 YEATS8.The S230 of YEATS2 is a small side chain residue, rendering a more open pocket around the tip of the acyl group compared to AF9 (Figure 1J). Such a feature likely accounts for the recognition of the bulky and branched Khib by YEATS2 (Figure 1D). Sequence alignment shows that YEATS2 is the only YEATS protein in human that has a small side chain residue at this position (Figure 1K), suggesting that YEATS2 is likely the only YEATS domain protein that reads Khib, a new type of histone mark that was shown to associate with active gene transcription in meiotic and post-meiotic cells9. In support, AF9 displayed no binding to H31-34K27hib in the ITC assay (Supplementary information, Figure S2C).In summary, here we identify YEATS2 as a selective histone crotonylation reader with site specificity for H3K27. Our structural study reveals an end-open aromatic sandwich pocket within YEATS2 for Kcr binding. As most Kac-binding bromodomains do not have histone Kcr-binding activity3, selective reading of Kcr among other short-chain acyl groups by YEATS2 highlights the functional difference between the YEATS and the bromodomain families of Kac readers9,10. Given the distinct genomic distributions of Kcr and Khib from Kac during cellular processes such as male germ cell differentiation8,9, the current study calls attention to a new regulatory mechanism that links cellular metabolism to epigenetic regulation centered on histone Kcr or Khib reading by YEATS2 and its associated ATAC complex.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201649"
"cr","Crystal structure of PXY-TDIF complex reveals a conserved recognition mechanism among CLE peptide-receptor pairs","Plants can achieve amazing lifespans because of their continuous and repetitive formation of new organs by stem cells present within meristems. The balance between proliferation and differentiation of meristem cells is largely regulated by the CLAVATA3/ENDOSPERM SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) peptide hormones. One of the well-characterized CLE peptides, CLE41/TDIF (tracheary elements differentiation inhibitory factor), functions to suppress tracheary element differentiation and promote procambial cell proliferation, playing important roles in vascular development and wood formation. The recognition mechanisms of TDIF or other CLE peptides by their respective receptors, however, remain largely elusive. Here we report the crystal structure of TDIF in complex with its receptor PXY, a leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK). Our structure reveals that TDIF mainly adopts an “Ω”-like conformation binding to the inner surface of the LRR domain of PXY. Interaction between TDIF and PXY is predominately mediated by the relatively conserved amino acids of TDIF. Structure-based sequence alignment showed that the TDIF-interacting motifs are also conserved among other known CLE receptors. Our data provide a structural template for understanding the recognition mechanism of CLE peptides by their receptors, offering an opportunity for the identification of receptors of other uncharacterized CLE peptides.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201645"
"cr","MLKL forms cation channels","The mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) protein is a key factor in tumor necrosis factor-induced necroptosis. Recent studies on necroptosis execution revealed a commitment role of MLKL in membrane disruption. However, our knowledge of how MLKL functions on membrane remains very limited. Here we demonstrate that MLKL forms cation channels that are permeable preferentially to Mg2+ rather than Ca2+ in the presence of Na+ and K+. Moreover, the N-terminal domain containing six helices (H1-H6) is sufficient to form channels. Using the substituted cysteine accessibility method, we further determine that helix H1, H2, H3, H5 and H6 are transmembrane segments, while H4 is located in the cytoplasm. Finally, MLKL-induced membrane depolarization and cell death exhibit a positive correlation to its channel activity. The Mg2+-preferred permeability and five transmembrane segment topology distinguish MLKL from previously identified Mg2+-permeable channels and thus establish MLKL as a novel class of cation channels.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201626"
"cr","CircRNA-derived pseudogenes","Circular RNAs (circRNAs) from pre-mRNA back-splicing have been recently re-discovered genome-wide in metazoans by taking advantage of RNA deep-sequencing (RNA-seq) of the non-polyadenylated transcriptomes and specific computational pipelines that can retrieve the non-colinear back-splicing junction reads1,2,3,4,5. Despite being inefficiently processed and mostly expressed at a low level1,2,6,7,8, some circRNAs are derived from genomic loci associated with human diseases9, and increasing lines of evidence have suggested their potential roles in transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational regulation10. However, nothing is known about whether these exceptionally stable circRNAs can be retrotranscribed, and ultimately inserted back into the host genome as processed pseudogenes.Theoretically, a linear mRNA-derived pseudogene keeps the same sequential order (colinear) of exons as in its parent linear mRNA (Figure 1A). In contrast, a circRNA-derived pseudogene would have an exon-exon junction in a reversed order (non-colinear) (Figure 1B). By taking advantage of this feature, we developed a computational pipeline (CIRCpseudo) to identify potential circRNA-derived pseudogenes in the mouse reference genome (Figure 1C and Supplementary information, Data S1). Among them, at least 33 pseudogenes are possibly derived from the same circular RNA at the RFWD2 (ring finger and WD repeat domain 2) locus (circRFWD2) with the characteristic non-colinear back-splicing junction sequences that anchor exon 6-exon 2 in a reversed order (Figure 1D and Supplementary information, Table S1A). We referred to these 33 pseudogenes as “high-confidence circRFWD2-derived pseudogenes” owing to the existence of the non-colinear exon 6-exon 2 junction sequence.Figure 1Characterization of circRNA-derived pseudogenes and their potential role in reshaping genome architecture.

(D) Characterization of mouse circRFWD2-derived pseudogenes. A circRFWD2 that contains exons 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 with back-splicing of the exon 6-exon 2 junction sequence was produced from the mouse chr1:159 232 326-159 347 580 locus (top), and could be retrotransposed (middle, gray box) to generate pseudogenes at different genomic regions (bottom). *, MMERVK10C-int LTR retrotransposon sequences.

(G) A CTCF-binding site resides in the mouse circSATB1-derived pseudogene region in the mouse ENCODE MEL and G1E cell lines.

For example, although a circRNA-derived pseudogene could be produced from a circRNA, if its back-splicing junction sequence was either not reverse transcribed to cDNA prior to its insertion into the genome, or reverse transcribed to cDNAs and inserted into the genome but lost during evolution, it cannot be revealed by CIRCpseudo. Supporting this notion, when mapping linear RFWD2 cDNA sequence to the mouse reference genome, another nine RFWD2-related pseudogenes were also found in the mouse genome. Different from the high-confidence circRFWD2-derived pseudogenes with the non-colinear exon 6-exon 2 junction sequences, these nine pseudogenes contain sequences only in circRFWD2-residing exons, i.e., exons 2 to 4 or 5, but lack the back-splicing exon 6-exon 2 junction sequences and the sequences outside of circRFWD2. Thus, we referred this subgroup of nine pseudogenes as “low-confidence circRFWD2-derived pseudogenes” (Supplementary information, Table S1A). In addition, we detected six more RFWD2-related pseudogenes with sequences beyond circRFWD2-residing exons (Supplementary information, Table S1A), which suggests that these six RFWD2-related pseudogenes might have originated from retrotransposition of (linear) RFWD2 mRNA.Although most, except two high-confidence and one low-confidence, circRFWD2-derived pseudogenes (Supplementary information, Table S1A) have been annotated previously, none was annotated as retrotransposed from the RFWD2 circRNA. The finding of circRFWD2-derived pseudogenes thus suggests a previously unknown impact of circRNAs: to insert into the genome and change genomic DNA composition. Interestingly, these circRFWD2-derived pseudogenes contain different lengths of circRFWD2-related sequences with different mutation rates (Figure 1D and data not shown), suggesting different insertion times and/or distinct evolutionary constraints imposed on these circRFWD2-derived pseudogenes. All 33 high-confidence circRFWD2-derived pseudogenes could be found in the genomes of eight other mouse strains examined but not in rat and primate genomes (Supplementary information, Figure S1A and data not shown). This suggests that the retrotransposition of circRFWD2 occurred in the common mouse ancestor after its divergence from rat and human lineages.It is generally believed that pseudogenes processed from (linear) mRNAs contain a canonical structural feature of having a poly(A) tail at the 3′ end11, and a 3′ poly(A) sequence was recently reported to be required for LINE-1-mediated retrotransposition in human12. We therefore examined the adenosine numbers within UCSC-annotated poly(A) tails of all pseudogenes that have mouse RFWD2 origin (Supplementary information, Table S1A). Interestingly, 39 out of the 42 circRFWD2-derived pseudogenes (annotated as pseudogenes also by UCSC) contain only a few adenosines in their UCSC-annotated 3′ end poly(A) tails in general; in contrast, the six linear RFWD2 mRNA-derived pseudogenes on average are enriched with adenosines in their 3′ ends (Figure 1E and Supplementary information, Table S1A). This further suggests that circRFWD2-derived pseudogenes might have originated from circRNAs that in general rarely have canonical poly(A) tails. In addition, mouse LTR sequences are highly enriched in the flanking regions of 42 mouse circRFWD2-derived pseudogenes, compared to those that flank the annotated RefGenes and RetroGenes (Figure 1F). This analysis indicates that the retrotransposition of the circRFWD2-derived pseudogenes might be associated with retrotransposons in mouse. The detailed mechanism of circRNA retrotransposition remains mysterious.Another two high-confidence and dozens of low-confidence circRNA-derived pseudogenes were additionally identified in the mouse reference genome (Supplementary information, Figure S1B and Table S1B). Interestingly, the mouse circSATB1-derived pseudogene could be found in all examined mouse strains and the rat reference genome (Supplementary information, Figure S1B, left panel), suggesting that the retrotransposition of circSATB1-derived pseudogene might have occurred in the common ancestor of mice and rats. In contrast, the mouse circDIAP3-derived pseudogene homolog could be identified in some but not all examined mouse strains (Supplementary information, Figure S1B, right panel), suggesting that the retrotransposition of circDIAP3-derived pseudogene might have occurred after the divergence of different mouse strains.We also identified a few cases of high-confidence and dozens of low-confidence circRNA-derived pseudogenes using a similar strategy in human genomes (Supplementary information, Figure S1C and Table S1C). Interestingly, the homologous sequences of human circPRKDC-derived and circCAMSAP1-derived pseudogenes could be found in the gorilla and chimp genomes but not in the rhesus genome (Supplementary information, Figure S1C), indicating that their retrotransposition might have happened very recently in evolution. It is worth noting that some pseudogenes, although having non-colinear exon-exon junctions, could be produced by other mechanisms, such as reverse transcription that could go through open-ended but highly-structured RNAs with close enough 5′ and 3′ ends (Supplementary information, Figure S1D).Although the total number is low so far, the finding of circRNA-derived pseudogenes suggests a previously underestimated impact of circRNAs on host genome by retrotransposition. Are these insertions of retrotransposed circRNAs functional? Expressed pseudogenes have been suggested to play important roles in cellular differentiation and cancer progression13. The detection of expressed circRNA-derived pseudogenes could be limited by the sequence similarity between circRNA-derived pseudogenes and their original circRNAs, especially at the non-colinear back-splicing junction regions, which are key to the annotation of circRNAs. For example, RNA-seq reads that are mapped to circRFWD2 are similar to the sequences from circRFWD2-derived pseudogenes (Supplementary information, Figure S1E).In addition to their potential functions at the RNA level after transcription, we speculated that the insertion of retrotransposed circRNAs might be involved in gene expression regulation by altering the genome structure. Intriguingly, a CTCF/Rad21-binding site in the mouse MEL and G1E cell lines was identified to overlap exactly with circSATB1-derived pseudogene locus (Figure 1G and data not shown). This area has also been suggested as an enhancer region with active H3K4me1 signals. The CTCF binding is specific for the circSATB1-derived pseudogene region, but not its original SATB1 region of exons 2, 3, 4 and 5 for circSATB1 (Supplementary information, Figure S1F). As CTCF binding could affect chromosome configuration and thus regulate gene expression14, this finding may indicate an unexpected biological effect originated from circRNAs. Strikingly, the circSATB1-derived pseudogene could not be found in the examined human genomes, neither could the corresponding CTCF-binding site be found in available CTCF datasets (Supplementary information, Figure S1G).This study demonstrates that pseudogenes can be retrotransposed from circRNAs and, importantly, inherited in mammalian genomes. Their existence in the genome has the potential to reshape genome architecture by providing additional CTCF-binding sites. Further efforts are needed to decipher the molecular mechanism of circRNA retrotransposition, annotate circRNA-derived pseudogenes in different species, profile their expression patterns in various transcriptomes, and demonstrate what other unexpected roles they could play in cell.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201642"
"cr","Ubiquitin modifications","Protein ubiquitination is a dynamic multifaceted post-translational modification involved in nearly all aspects of eukaryotic biology. Once attached to a substrate, the 76-amino acid protein ubiquitin is subjected to further modifications, creating a multitude of distinct signals with distinct cellular outcomes, referred to as the 'ubiquitin code'. Ubiquitin can be ubiquitinated on seven lysine (Lys) residues or on the N-terminus, leading to polyubiquitin chains that can encompass complex topologies. Alternatively or in addition, ubiquitin Lys residues can be modified by ubiquitin-like molecules (such as SUMO or NEDD8). Finally, ubiquitin can also be acetylated on Lys, or phosphorylated on Ser, Thr or Tyr residues, and each modification has the potential to dramatically alter the signaling outcome. While the number of distinctly modified ubiquitin species in cells is mind-boggling, much progress has been made to characterize the roles of distinct ubiquitin modifications, and many enzymes and receptors have been identified that create, recognize or remove these ubiquitin modifications. We here provide an overview of the various ubiquitin modifications present in cells, and highlight recent progress on ubiquitin chain biology. We then discuss the recent findings in the field of ubiquitin acetylation and phosphorylation, with a focus on Ser65-phosphorylation and its role in mitophagy and Parkin activation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201639"
"cr","Ubiquitin signaling in immune responses","Ubiquitination has emerged as a crucial mechanism that regulates signal transduction in diverse biological processes, including different aspects of immune functions. Ubiquitination regulates pattern-recognition receptor signaling that mediates both innate immune responses and dendritic cell maturation required for initiation of adaptive immune responses. Ubiquitination also regulates the development, activation, and differentiation of T cells, thereby maintaining efficient adaptive immune responses to pathogens and immunological tolerance to self-tissues. Like phosphorylation, ubiquitination is a reversible reaction tightly controlled by the opposing actions of ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinases. Deregulated ubiquitination events are associated with immunological disorders, including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201640"
"cr","Substrate specificity of the ubiquitin and Ubl proteases","Conjugation and deconjugation of ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubls) to cellular proteins are highly regulated processes integral to cellular homeostasis. Most often, the C-termini of these small polypeptides are attached to lysine side chains of target proteins by an amide (isopeptide) linkage. Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) and Ubl-specific proteases (ULPs) comprise a diverse group of proteases that recognize and remove ubiquitin and Ubls from their substrates. How DUBs and ULPs distinguish among different modifiers, or different polymeric forms of these modifiers, remains poorly understood. The specificity of ubiquitin/Ubl-deconjugating enzymes for particular substrates depends on multiple factors, ranging from the topography of specific substrate features, as in different polyubiquitin chain types, to structural elements unique to each enzyme. Here we summarize recent structural and biochemical studies that provide insights into mechanisms of substrate specificity among various DUBs and ULPs. We also discuss the unexpected specificities of non-eukaryotic proteases in these families.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201638"
"cr","CCAR1 5′ UTR as a natural miRancer of miR-1254 overrides tamoxifen resistance","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) typically bind to unstructured miRNA-binding sites in target RNAs, leading to a mutual repression of expression. Here, we report that miR-1254 interacts with structured elements in cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 1 (CCAR1) 5′ untranslated region (UTR) and this interaction enhances the stability of both molecules. miR-1254 can also act as a repressor when binding to unstructured sites in its targets. Interestingly, structured miR-1254-targeting sites act as both a functional RNA motif-sensing unit, and an independent RNA functional unit that enhances miR-1254 expression. Artificially designed miRNA enhancers, termed “miRancers”, can stabilize and enhance the activity of miRNAs of interest. We further demonstrate that CCAR1 5′ UTR as a natural miRancer of endogenous miR-1254 re-sensitizes tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells to tamoxifen. Thus, our study presents a novel model of miRNA function, wherein highly structured miRancer-like motif-containing RNA fragments or miRancer molecules specifically interact with miRNAs, leading to reciprocal stabilization.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201632"

In mammalian cells, much of the protein degradation is carried out by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Similar to kinases, components of the ubiquitin system are often dysregulated, leading to a variety of diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration, making them attractive drug targets. However, so far there are only a handful of drugs targeting the ubiquitin system that have been approved by the FDA.

"cr","A positive role for polycomb in transcriptional regulation via H4K20me1","The highly conserved polycomb group (PcG) proteins maintain heritable transcription repression of the genes essential for development from fly to mammals. However, sporadic reports imply a potential role of PcGs in positive regulation of gene transcription, although systematic investigation of such function and the underlying mechanism has rarely been reported. Here, we report a Pc-mediated, H3K27me3-dependent positive transcriptional regulation of Senseless (Sens), a key transcription factor required for development. Mechanistic studies show that Pc regulates Sens expression by promoting H4K20me1 at the Sens locus. Further bioinformatic analysis at genome-wide level indicates that the existence of H4K20me1 acts as a selective mark for positive transcriptional regulation by Pc/H3K27me3. Both the intensities and specific patterns of Pc and H3K27me3 are important for the fates of target gene transcription. Moreover, binding of transcription factor Broad (Br), which physically interacts with Pc and positively regulates the transcription of Sens, is observed in Pc+H3K27me3+H4K20me1+ genes, but not in Pc+H3K27me3+H4K20me1− genes. Taken together, our study reveals that, coupling with the transcription factor Br, Pc positively regulates transcription of Pc+H3K27me3+H4K20me1+ genes in developing Drosophila wing disc.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201633"

Although the Ub system is exclusive to eukaryotes, prokaryotic bacteria have developed an armory of Ub ligase enzymes that are capable of employing the Ub systems of various hosts, ranging from plant to animal cells. These enzymes have been acquired through the evolution and can be classified into three main classes, RING (really interesting new gene), HECT (homologous to the E6-AP carboxyl terminus) and NEL (novel E3 ligases). In this review we describe the roles played by different classes of bacterial Ub ligases in infection and pathogenicity. We also provide an overview of the different mechanisms by which bacteria mimic specific components of the host Ub system and outline the gaps in our current understanding of their functions. Additionally, we discuss approaches and experimental tools for validating this class of enzymes as potential novel antibacterial therapy targets.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201630"
"cr","Oocyte-expressed yes-associated protein is a key activator of the early zygotic genome in mouse","In early mammalian embryos, the genome is transcriptionally quiescent until the zygotic genome activation (ZGA) which occurs 2-3 days after fertilization. Despite a long-standing effort, maternal transcription factors regulating this crucial developmental event remain largely elusive. Here, using maternal and paternal mouse models of Yap1 deletion, we show that maternally accumulated yes-associated protein (YAP) in oocyte is essential for ZGA. Maternal Yap1-knockout embryos exhibit a prolonged two-cell stage and develop into the four-cell stage at a much slower pace than the wild-type controls. Transcriptome analyses identify YAP target genes in early blastomeres; two of which, Rpl13 and Rrm2, are required to mediate maternal YAP's effect in conferring developmental competence on preimplantation embryos. Furthermore, the physiological YAP activator, lysophosphatidic acid, can substantially improve early development of wild-type, but not maternal Yap1-knockout embryos in both oviduct and culture. These observations provide insights into the mechanisms of ZGA, and suggest potentials of YAP activators in improving the developmental competence of cultured embryos in assisted human reproduction and animal biotechnology.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201620"
"cr","saRNA-guided Ago2 targets the RITA complex to promoters to stimulate transcription","Small activating RNAs (saRNAs) targeting specific promoter regions are able to stimulate gene expression at the transcriptional level, a phenomenon known as RNA activation (RNAa). It is known that RNAa depends on Ago2 and is associated with epigenetic changes at the target promoters. However, the precise molecular mechanism of RNAa remains elusive. Using human CDKN1A (p21) as a model gene, we characterized the molecular nature of RNAa. We show that saRNAs guide Ago2 to and associate with target promoters. saRNA-loaded Ago2 facilitates the assembly of an RNA-induced transcriptional activation (RITA) complex, which, in addition to saRNA-Ago2 complex, includes RHA and CTR9, the latter being a component of the PAF1 complex. RITA interacts with RNA polymerase II to stimulate transcription initiation and productive elongation, accompanied by monoubiquitination of histone 2B. Our results establish the existence of a cellular RNA-guided genome-targeting and transcriptional activation mechanism and provide important new mechanistic insights into the RNAa process.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201622"

However, to accurately analyze the mechanism by which transcriptome, genome and DNA methylome regulate each other, these omic methods need to be performed in the same single cell. Here we demonstrate a single-cell triple omics sequencing technique, scTrio-seq, that can be used to simultaneously analyze the genomic copy-number variations (CNVs), DNA methylome, and transcriptome of an individual mammalian cell. We show that large-scale CNVs cause proportional changes in RNA expression of genes within the gained or lost genomic regions, whereas these CNVs generally do not affect DNA methylation in these regions. Furthermore, we applied scTrio-seq to 25 single cancer cells derived from a human hepatocellular carcinoma tissue sample. We identified two subpopulations within these cells based on CNVs, DNA methylome, or transcriptome of individual cells. Our work offers a new avenue of dissecting the complex contribution of genomic and epigenomic heterogeneities to the transcriptomic heterogeneity within a population of cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201623"
"cr","The RNA-binding protein Mex3B is a coreceptor of Toll-like receptor 3 in innate antiviral response","Recognition of viral dsRNA by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) leads to induction of interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines, and innate antiviral response. Here we identified the RNA-binding protein Mex3B as a positive regulator of TLR3-mediated signaling by expression cloning screens. Cells from Mex3b−/− mice exhibited reduced production of IFN-β in response to the dsRNA analog poly(I:C) but not infection with RNA viruses. Mex3b−/− mice injected with poly(I:C) was more resistant to poly(I:C)-induced death. Mex3B was associated with TLR3 in the endosomes. It bound to dsRNA and increased the dsRNA-binding activity of TLR3. Mex3B also promoted the proteolytic processing of TLR3, which is critical for its activation. Mutants of Mex3B lacking its RNA-binding activity inhibited TLR3-mediated IFN-β induction. These findings suggest that Mex3B acts as a coreceptor of TLR3 in innate antiviral response.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201616"
"cr","Casilio: a versatile CRISPR-Cas9-Pumilio hybrid for gene regulation and genomic labeling","The CRISPR-Cas9 system has recently been widely adopted in genome editing due to its simplicity1,2,3. Nuclease-deficient mutant dCas9 protein can be fused to effector domains and the fusion proteins can be guided by sgRNAs to genomic sites to regulate gene expression or label chromosomes4,5,6,7,8,9,10. However, only one type of effector is applied in most experiments due to the exclusive sgRNA:Cas9 pairing. Moreover, multimerization by directly fusing multiple copies of effectors with dCas9 protein to achieve sufficient effector activity is technically challenging. RNA aptamer approaches utilizing viral RNA sequences such as MS2 and PP7 have been combined with the CRISPR-Cas9 system to provide tools with improved multiplexing and multimerization functionalities11,12. However, there are a limited number of well-characterized RNA aptamers. Furthermore, incorporation of three or more copies of these structured aptamers onto sgRNA reduces sgRNA expression, thus limiting the number of effector proteins that can be recruited. We established here the Casilio system by combining CRISPR-Cas9 and Pumilio RNA-binding protein. Pumilio and FBF proteins share a conserved Pumilio/FBF (PUF) RNA-binding domain which is programmable to bind a specific 8-mer RNA sequence (PUF-binding site, PBS)13,14 (Figure 1A). The Casilio system consists of the dCas9 protein, an sgRNA appended with one or more PUF-binding site(s) (sgRNA-PBS), and an effector fused with a PUF domain (PUF fusion) (Figure 1A). The sgRNA-PBS specifies both DNA binding via its spacer sequence and effector recruitment via PBS.Figure 1The Casilio system enables multiplexing and multimerization of effectors for gene regulation, epigenetic editing and chromosomal labeling. (A) Schematics of the Casilio system. Top: comparison of conventional dCas9 fusion and Casilio tethering of effectors. Center: the 8-repeat PUF domain and the corresponding 8-mer target RNA.

(iii) CREST immunostaining to validate labeling of centromeres by dCas9/Clover-PUFc/sgCentromere-20×PBSc. (iv) Co-labeling of centromeres and telomeres by the Casilio system. (G) Cartoon highlighting three major features of the Casilio system.Full size imageFirst, to test whether insertion of PBS at the 3′ end of sgRNA affects its function, we generated a series of TetO-targeting (sgTetO) and control (sgCtl) sgRNAs with 0-47 copies of PBSa or PBSb, and tested their ability to direct dCas9-VP64 to activate tdTomato expression in a HEK293T/TetO::tdTomato cell line (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). All of the sgTetO-PBS but none of the sgCtl-PBS directed dCas9-VP64 to activate TetO::tdTomato, demonstrating that dCas9-VP64/sgRNA can tolerate insertion of at least 47 copies of PBS. Next, we tested whether sgRNAs with different copy numbers of PBS can recruit PUF-VP64 to activate TetO::tdTomato reporter (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). For both PUFa-VP64/sgRNA-PBSa and PUFb-VP64/sgRNA-PBSb, the modules with 5-10 copies of PBS appended to the sgRNA activated the TetO::tdTomato most efficiently, whereas those with 15, 20, and 47 copies of PBS led to lower albeit substantial activation (Supplementary information, Figure S1B).We then tested whether specificity of PUF-PBS pairs provides independence between Casilio modules. In addition to PUFa-VP64/sgRNA-PBSa and PUFb-VP64/sgRNA-PBSb, we constructed two additional activator modules, PUFw-VP64/sgRNA-PBSw and PUFc-VP64/sgRNA-PBSc (Figure 1A), and tested their ability to activate TetO::tdTomato expression. As shown in Figure 1B, PUF-VP64 activated TetO::tdTomato expression only when the sgRNA with the cognate PBS was provided. This demonstrates that the Casilio modules with different PUF domains can operate independently with high specificity.A recent paper showed p65HSF1 as a potent transcriptional activation domain15. We constructed Casilio activator module PUFa-p65HSF1 and compared it with PUFa-VP64 for the ability to activate TetO::tdTomato. PUFa-p65HSF1 showed an increase in TetO::tdTomato activation by approximately 3-fold compared with PUFa-VP64 and even enabled activation with the presence of one copy of PBSa in the sgRNA (Supplementary information, Figure S1C). We thus switched to PUF-p65HSF1 for subsequent experiments.To test the possibility that recruitment of multiple molecules of p65HSF1 by sgRNA-PBS might increase transactivation activity, we compared activation of endogenous genes OCT4 and SOX2 in HEK293T cells induced by the Casilio system with that induced by a direct dCas9-p65HSF1 activator using either a cocktail of 4 sgRNA-PBS per gene or individual sgRNA-PBS. Using either the sgRNA-PBS cocktail or a single sgRNA-PBS, we observed higher activation using the Casilio system compared to the direct fusion for both OCT4 and SOX2 activation. We observed little to no activation by single targeting of the dCas9-p65HSF1 fusion protein to OCT4 and SOX2 while robust activation was observed in the corresponding Casilio experiments (Figure 1C and Supplementary information, Figure S1D). These results demonstrate the superior activity of Casilio activator over the direct fusion approach. We then sought to determine the optimal number of PBS for activation of endogenous genes and found that 5 copies of PBS produced the highest activation, resembling results from the TetO::tdTomato activation experiment (Supplementary information, Figure S1E).To test the feasibility of the Casilio system to recruit various effectors to distinct targets, we tested repression of eGFP by a KRAB-PUFa repressor and activation of tdTomato by a PUFc-p65HSF1 activator simultaneously in a HEK293T/TetO::tdTomato/SV40::EGFP cell line (Supplementary information, Figure S1F). When both modules were applied, simultaneous activation of TetO::tdTomato and repression of SV40::EGFP were achieved (Supplementary information, Figure S1F). Next, we tested whether the expression of multiple endogenous genes can be independently regulated using this strategy. We directed the Casilio activator and repressor modules to OCT4 and SOX2 promoters, respectively, and observed simultaneous activation of OCT4 and repression of SOX2 when two sets of sgRNA-5×PBS individually targeting OCT4 and SOX2 were introduced into cells together with dCas9 and PUF fusions (Figure 1D).A recent study used dCas9-tethered histone acetyltransferase (HAT) to activate enhancers10. We tested whether the Casilio system could recruit multiple molecules of HAT domain to increase the efficiency of epigenetic editing. We targeted the proximal promoter (PP), proximal enhancer (PE) and distal enhancer (DE) of OCT4 with cocktails of 4 sgRNA-PBS for each region (Figure 1E). We constructed fusions of the HAT domain from CREB-binding protein (CBP) attached to the C-terminus of dCas9 (dCas9-CBPHAT), and N-terminus (CBPHAT-PUFa) and C-terminus (PUFa-CBPHAT) of PUFa and tested their ability to activate OCT4 expression. dCas9-CBPHAT and CBPHAT-PUFa modules have similar activity at PP. Interestingly, the Casilio modules have higher efficiency in activating OCT4 gene via PE and DE compared to dCas9-CBPHAT, with CBPHAT-PUFa giving the highest activation (Figure 1E). In addition, CBPHAT-PUFa could mediate significant OCT4 activation when directed by a single sgRNA-5×PBSa (Supplementary information, Figure S1G).Another important application of dCas9 is to label genomic loci for live cell imaging9. We first tested whether the Casilio system can label telomeric repeats using sgTelomere (Supplementary information, Figure S2A) appended with 0, 5, 15 or 25 copies of PBSa to recruit Clover-PUFa (Figure 1F). Expression of sgTelomere-5×PBSa, -15×PBSa and -25×PBSa with dCas9 and Clover-PUFa produced fluorescent foci at telomeres (Figure 1Fi), as confirmed by their overlap with immunostaining signals of telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 (TRF2) (Figure 1Fii). Interestingly, the strength of telomere labeling increased as more copies of PBS were appended to sgTelomere-PBS (Figure 1Fi). Quantification of foci number and signal-to-noise ratio in cells expressing sgRNA with 5, 15 or 25 copies of PBSa confirmed such increase (Supplementary information, Figure S2C and S2D), suggesting that the multimerization feature of the Casilio system allows titration of labeling intensity at target loci. We further tested the ability of the Casilio system to simultaneously label centromeres and telomeres. By using sgRNA to target alpha-satellite repeats in centromeres (sgCentromere-20×PBSc; Supplementary information, Figure S2B), we observed specific centromere labeling as confirmed by CREST immunostaining (Figure 1Fiii). Although not all centromeres marked by CREST were detected by the Casilio system, likely due to the low number of sgCentromere-binding sites in some centromeres (Supplementary information, Figure S2B), most of the Casilio signal overlapped with CREST signals. When we co-introduced Clover-PUFc/sgCentromere-20×PBSc, Ruby-PUFa/sgTelomere-25×PBSa and dCas9 into HEK293T cells, we observed simultaneous labeling of both centromeres and telomeres in the same cells (Figure 1Fiv), demonstrating that the Casilio system can be used to independently label multiple genomic loci.In conclusion, here we show that the Casilio system can achieve multiplexing and multimerization of proteins such as transcriptional regulators, epigenetic modifiers and fluorescent proteins at defined genomic loci (Figure 1G). The main advantages of the Casilio system include: (I) Multiplexing. Different Casilio modules can be simultaneously delivered into a cell and each can operate at their defined target sites with independent function. Since PUF domains can be easily programmed to recognize any 8-mer RNA motifs, this greatly expands the potential number of independent Casilio modules. (II) Multimerization. Simplicity of the linear 8-mer PBS motif allows extensive multimerization of PUF fusions on sgRNA-PBS without hindering sgRNA transcription or dCas9/sgRNA DNA-binding activity. This feature allows multiple molecules of PUF fusions to be assembled on the sgRNA, achieving localized concentration of effectors or protein tags. This is particularly beneficial for fluorescent imaging and transcriptional regulation. This feature may facilitate labeling of non-repeat sequences where tiling of > 30 sgRNAs were required9. (III) Complex formation. With further development and optimization, the sgRNA-PBS has the potential to act as an RNA scaffold for PUF-directed assembly of stoichiometrically defined protein complexes. Specifically, different numbers of PBS with varying specificities can be appended to the sgRNA to enable the assembly of multiprotein complex with defined stoichiometry and defined ordering along the sgRNA-PBS (Figure 1G). Considering these features, we believe that the Casilio system will become a powerful tool for studying gene function and chromosome structure.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20163"
"cr","SIRT6 safeguards human mesenchymal stem cells from oxidative stress by coactivating NRF2","SIRT6 belongs to the mammalian homologs of Sir2 histone NAD+-dependent deacylase family. In rodents, SIRT6 deficiency leads to aging-associated degeneration of mesodermal tissues. It remains unknown whether human SIRT6 has a direct role in maintaining the homeostasis of mesodermal tissues. To this end, we generated SIRT6 knockout human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) by targeted gene editing. SIRT6-deficient hMSCs exhibited accelerated functional decay, a feature distinct from typical premature cellular senescence. Rather than compromised chromosomal stability, SIRT6-null hMSCs were predominately characterized by dysregulated redox metabolism and increased sensitivity to the oxidative stress. In addition, we found SIRT6 in a protein complex with both nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and RNA polymerase II, which was required for the transactivation of NRF2-regulated antioxidant genes, including heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). Overexpression of HO-1 in SIRT6-null hMSCs rescued premature cellular attrition. Our study uncovers a novel function of SIRT6 in maintaining hMSC homeostasis by serving as a NRF2 coactivator, which represents a new layer of regulation of oxidative stress-associated stem cell decay.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20164"

The extracorporeal cell-based bioartificial liver (BAL) system could bridge liver transplantation and facilitate liver regeneration for ALF patients by providing metabolic detoxification and synthetic functions. Previous BAL systems, based on hepatoma cells and non-human hepatocytes, achieved limited clinical advances, largely due to poor hepatic functions, cumbersome preparation or safety concerns of these cells. We previously generated human functional hepatocytes by lineage conversion (hiHeps). Here, by improving functional maturity of hiHeps and producing hiHeps at clinical scales (3 billion cells), we developed a hiHep-based BAL system (hiHep-BAL). In a porcine ALF model, hiHep-BAL treatment restored liver functions, corrected blood levels of ammonia and bilirubin, and prolonged survival. Importantly, human albumin and α-1-antitrypsin were detectable in hiHep-BAL-treated ALF pigs. Moreover, hiHep-BAL treatment led to attenuated liver damage, resolved inflammation and enhanced liver regeneration. Our findings indicate a promising clinical application of the hiHep-BAL system.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20166"

Here we show that microRNAs (miRNAs) have important roles during naive to primed pluripotency transition. Dgcr8−/− embryonic stem cells (ESCs) failed to completely silence the naive pluripotency program, as well as to establish the primed pluripotency program during differentiation. miRNA profiling revealed that expression levels of a large number of miRNAs changed dynamically and rapidly during naive to primed pluripotency transition. Furthermore, a miRNA screen identified numerous miRNAs promoting naive to primed pluripotency transition. Unexpectedly, multiple miRNAs from miR-290 and miR-302 clusters, previously shown as pluripotency-promoting miRNAs, demonstrated the strongest effects in silencing naive pluripotency. Knockout of both miR-290 and miR-302 clusters but not either alone blocked the silencing of naive pluripotency program. Mechanistically, the miR-290/302 family of miRNAs may facilitate the exit of naive pluripotency in part by promoting the activity of MEK pathway and through directly repressing Akt1. Our study reveals miRNAs as an important class of regulators potentiating ESCs to transition from naive to primed pluripotency, and uncovers context-dependent functions of the miR-290/302 family of miRNAs at different developmental stages.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20162"
"cr","The transcriptional regulator network of human inflammatory macrophages is defined by open chromatin","Differentiation of inflammatory macrophages from monocytes is characterized by an orderly integration of epigenetic and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms guided by lineage-determining transcription factors such as PU.1. Further activation of macrophages leads to a stimulus- or microenvironment-specific signal integration with subsequent transcriptional control established by the action of tissue- or signal-associated transcription factors. Here, we assess four histone modifications during human macrophage activation and integrate this information with the gene expression data from 28 different macrophage activation conditions in combination with GM-CSF. Bioinformatically, for inflammatory macrophages we define a unique network of transcriptional and epigenetic regulators (TRs), which was characterized by accessible promoters independent of the activation signal. In contrast to the general accessibility of promoters of TRs, mRNA expression of central TRs belonging to the TR network displayed stimulus-specific expression patterns, indicating a second level of transcriptional regulation beyond epigenetic chromatin changes. In contrast, stringent integration of epigenetic and transcriptional regulation was observed in networks of TRs established from somatic tissues and tissue macrophages. In these networks, clusters of TRs with permissive histone marks were associated with high gene expression whereas clusters with repressive chromatin marks were associated with absent gene expression. Collectively, these results support that macrophage activation during inflammation in contrast to lineage determination is mainly regulated transcriptionally by a pre-defined TR network.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20161"

Using whole genome sequences from a total of 58 canids (12 gray wolves, 27 primitive dogs from Asia and Africa, and a collection of 19 diverse breeds from across the world), we find that dogs from southern East Asia have significantly higher genetic diversity compared to other populations, and are the most basal group relating to gray wolves, indicating an ancient origin of domestic dogs in southern East Asia 33 000 years ago. Around 15 000 years ago, a subset of ancestral dogs started migrating to the Middle East, Africa and Europe, arriving in Europe at about 10 000 years ago. One of the out of Asia lineages also migrated back to the east, creating a series of admixed populations with the endemic Asian lineages in northern China before migrating to the New World.

These studies were initially motivated by the purported cardiogenic activity of these cells. Recent lineage tracing studies using Kit promoter to drive expression of the inducible Cre recombinase showed that these CSCs had highly limited cardiogenic activity, inadequate to support efficient cardiac repair. Here we reassess the lineage tracing data by investigating the identity of cells immediately after Cre labeling. Our instant lineage tracing approach identifies Kit-expressing cardiomyocytes, which are labeled immediately after tamoxifen induction. In combination with long-term lineage tracing experiments, these data reveal that the large majority of long-term labeled cardiomyocytes are pre-existing Kit-expressing cardiomyocytes rather than cardiomyocytes formed de novo from CSCs. This study presents a new interpretation for the contribution of Kit+ cells to cardiomyocytes and shows that Kit genetic lineage tracing over-estimates the cardiogenic activity of Kit+ CSCs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2015143"
"cr","Gasdermin D is an executor of pyroptosis and required for interleukin-1β secretion","Inflammasome is an intracellular signaling complex of the innate immune system. Activation of inflammasomes promotes the secretion of interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 and triggers pyroptosis. Caspase-1 and -11 (or -4/5 in human) in the canonical and non-canonical inflammasome pathways, respectively, are crucial for inflammasome-mediated inflammatory responses. Here we report that gasdermin D (GSDMD) is another crucial component of inflammasomes. We discovered the presence of GSDMD protein in nigericin-induced NLRP3 inflammasomes by a quantitative mass spectrometry-based analysis. Gene deletion of GSDMD demonstrated that GSDMD is required for pyroptosis and for the secretion but not proteolytic maturation of IL-1β in both canonical and non-canonical inflammasome responses. It was known that GSDMD is a substrate of caspase-1 and we showed its cleavage at the predicted site during inflammasome activation and that this cleavage was required for pyroptosis and IL-1β secretion. Expression of the N-terminal proteolytic fragment of GSDMD can trigger cell death and N-terminal modification such as tagging with Flag sequence disrupted the function of GSDMD. We also found that pro-caspase-1 is capable of processing GSDMD and ASC is not essential for GSDMD to function. Further analyses of LPS plus nigericin- or Salmonella typhimurium-treated macrophage cell lines and primary cells showed that apoptosis became apparent in Gsdmd−/− cells, indicating a suppression of apoptosis by pyroptosis. The induction of apoptosis required NLRP3 or other inflammasome receptors and ASC, and caspase-1 may partially contribute to the activation of apoptotic caspases in Gsdmd−/− cells. These data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of pyroptosis and reveal an unexpected interplay between apoptosis and pyroptosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2015139"
"cr","CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering of the ferret","Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) have served as one of the most valuable animal models for recapitulating human disease since 19331. This is because they show many similarities to humans in terms of physiological features of brain function and reproductive biology as well as pathological characteristics of various diseases such as cancer, influenza infection and cystic fibrosis2,3,4. Despite these advantages, the current use of ferrets in research is significantly limited due to the lack of a method enabling precise genetic modification.Here we report that by co-injecting Cas9 mRNA and sgRNAs into one-cell-stage embryos, founder ferrets with biallelic mutations in one of three genes (Dcx, Aspm and Disc1) can be generated with high efficiency up to 73.3%. Intriguingly, the founder animal carrying Dcx mutations showed a lissencephaly phenotype similar to human Doublecortin patients. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing allows for efficient generation of gene knockout ferrets.The CRISPR/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 system is a highly specific, efficient, and multiplexable approach for eukaryotic genome editing5,6,7. Due to the similarity of brain structure and development between ferret and human, we chose Dcx, Disc1 and Aspm, genes with well-known functions in brain development and gyrification, as the target genes8,9. Two sgRNAs were designed for each gene based on previously published studies5 and their target sites are shown in Supplementary information, Figure S1A. Since ferret cell lines are not yet available, we set out to test the efficiency of these sgRNAs with the Single Strand Annealing (SSA) luciferase reporter assay in 293T cells10. The targeting site for each sgRNA was sub-cloned into a reporter plasmid (Supplementary information, Figure S1B)10. We found that the Cas9/sgRNAs efficiently generated double-stranded breaks (DSBs) and homologous recombination repair was executed around their targeting sequences, indicated by the reconstitution of the luciferase activity (Supplementary information, Figure S1C). Based on these data, we chose sgRNAs with higher efficiency, Dcx-sgRNA1, Disc1-sgRNA2 and Aspm-sgRNA2, for the following embryo injection experiments.Next, we tested whether ferrets carrying targeted genetic mutations could be generated by direct embryo injection of the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA targeting Dcx were injected into ferret one-cell-stage embryos. Mutations in human X-linked Dcx gene cause gross neocortical disorganization (lissencephaly or “smooth brain”) in males, whereas females heterozygous for Dcx mutations show a mosaic phenotype featuring the presence of a normal cortex and a second band of misplaced (heterotopic) neurons beneath the cortex (“double cortex syndrome”)9.A total of 124 fertilized eggs at one-cell stage were collected (Supplementary information, Table S1A). Dcx-sgRNA1 (30 ng/μl) and Cas9 mRNA (20 ng/μl) were injected. 117 out of 124 injected zygotes were transferred into 10 surrogate females. Among the 10 surrogates, 5 had miscarriage 21 days after embryo transfer (Supplementary information, Table S1A). The first surrogate mother that went through the full-term pregnancy delivered one male (#1) and one female (#2) via caesarean section, but pup #2 died one day later (Figure 1A). Genomic DNAs from placenta and tail were isolated from both pups #1 and #2. Targeted genome modifications were screened by PCR amplification of regions surrounding the Dcx-sgRNA1 target sites, followed by the T7EN1 cleavage assay (Figure 1B) and sequencing analysis (Figure 1C). Different small insertions or deletions (indels) at the target site were detected by sequencing the PCR products (Figure 1C), demonstrating that the CRISPR/Cas9 system functions well in ferret embryos. The presence of gene modifications in pup #2 was further analyzed using genomic DNAs from heart, liver, kidney and muscle in addition to the tail and placenta, and the same mutant alleles were detected in these tissues, demonstrating that the target modifications have been ubiquitously and efficiently integrated into different tissues (Figure 1C). 13 more pups were delivered from the other 4 surrogate females later (Supplementary information, Figure S1D). In total, 11 out of 15 pups were detected to harbor Dcx modifications (Supplementary information, Figure S1D-S1E and Table S1A). Dcx is a brain-specific gene mutated in X-linked lissencephaly and the double cortex syndrome. In male patients, X-linked lissencephaly produces a smooth brain without normal folding of the brain surface due to lack of migration of immature neurons9. To assess whether a lissencephaly brain phenotype could be modeled in the Dcx-modified ferrets, we conducted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of ferret #1 (male) 14 weeks after its birth. MRI showed a smooth brain with thick cortex but no sulci, abnormal myelination of axonal fiber tracts and ventricular enlargement in this Dcx mutant ferret founder (Figure 1D), which resemble the typical phenotypes seen in male patients with Dcx mutations. This result demonstrates that the ferret can perfectly model the phenotypes of this human genetic disease, which was not achievable in rodent systems. Taken together, we have successfully achieved CRISPR/Cas9-mediated site-specific modifications in ferret genome by one-cell embryo microinjection.Figure 1CRISPR/Cas9-mediated modification of Dcx in different tissues of ferrets. (A) Photograph of 1-day-old founder pups #1 and #2. (B) PCR products of the target region of Dcx in founders and the results of the T7EN1 cleavage assay.

Only two potential off-target loci (Cdh8 and Sohlh2) were identified in ferret genome for Dcx sgRNA1. (F) PCR products of Cdh8 and Sohlh2 fragments in ferrets #1 and #2. (G) Sequences of PCR products shown in F reveal no mutations in potential off-target loci Cdh8 and Sohlh2.Full size imageWith the success of Dcx modification in ferret, we then sought to generate founder ferrets carrying mutations in Aspm and Disc1 genes. A total of 64 injected zygotes were transferred into 4 surrogate females for the Aspm targeting experiment, and 18 injected zygotes were transferred into 1 surrogate female for the Disc1 targeting experiment. In total, 12 pups for the Aspm experiment and 4 pups for the Disc1 experiment were delivered (Supplementary information, Table S1A). In each case, genomic DNA from the tail was collected and analyzed by PCR, T7EN1 cleavage assay and sequencing to examine the site-specific genome modifications. Characterization of the targeting sites by sequencing showed different indels with sizes ranging from −13 to +1 bp in ferret pups at these two target genes with an efficiency of 66.7% (8/12) for Aspm and 25% (1/4) for Disc1 (Supplementary information, Figure S1D-S1E and Table S1), suggesting that the CRISPR/Cas9 system functions efficiently in targeting different genes in ferret. To assess whether a microcephaly brain phenotype could be observed in ferrets with the Aspm gene modification, resembling patients with Aspm mutations, MRI was used to visualize the cortical structure. The ferret with Aspm mutation showed a smaller brain with gyrification defect compared to the wild type (Supplementary information, Figure S1F).To test whether off-target mutations occurred in these genetically modified ferrets, we screened the ferret genome and identified two potential off-target loci, Cdh8 and Sohlh2, for Dcx-sgRNA1(Figure 1E); no potential off-target sites were identified for Aspm and Disc1 sgRNAs according to the predicting rule described previously7. The fragments around all the potential off-target loci were PCR amplified, and then subjected to sequencing assay. No mutation was detected at these two potential off-target loci, Cdh8 and Sohlh2 (Figure 1F-1G and Supplementary information, Figure S2A-S2B). These results demonstrate that the Cas9/sgRNA used in our experiment does not generate detectable mutations in potential off-target loci, suggesting that the CRISPR/Cas9 system could be a reliable genome modification tool for ferrets. However, we could not rule out the possibility of the existence of other off-target loci, which cannot be predicted based on the current rule.Thus, our study demonstrates the high efficiency of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene editing in ferret and suggests the possibility of sophisticated genome engineering in many other species of which ES cells are not available. The establishment of gene-modified ferrets would facilitate the investigation of genes related to human diseases that are difficult to model in rodents and primates.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2015130"
"cr","Genome-scale detection of hypermethylated CpG islands in circulating cell-free DNA of hepatocellular carcinoma patients","Despite advances in DNA methylome analyses of cells and tissues, current techniques for genome-scale profiling of DNA methylation in circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) remain limited. Here we describe a methylated CpG tandems amplification and sequencing (MCTA-Seq) method that can detect thousands of hypermethylated CpG islands simultaneously in ccfDNA. This highly sensitive technique can work with genomic DNA as little as 7.5 pg, which is equivalent to 2.5 copies of the haploid genome. We have analyzed a cohort of tissue and plasma samples (n = 151) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and control subjects, identifying dozens of high-performance markers in blood for detecting small HCC (≤ 3 cm). Among these markers, 4 (RGS10, ST8SIA6, RUNX2 and VIM) are mostly specific for cancer detection, while the other 15, classified as a novel set, are already hypermethylated in the normal liver tissues. Two corresponding classifiers have been established, combination of which achieves a sensitivity of 94% with a specificity of 89% for the plasma samples from HCC patients (n = 36) and control subjects including cirrhosis patients (n = 17) and normal individuals (n = 38). Notably, all 15 alpha-fetoprotein-negative HCC patients were successfully identified. Comparison between matched plasma and tissue samples indicates that both the cancer and noncancerous tissues contribute to elevation of the methylation markers in plasma. MCTA-Seq will facilitate the development of ccfDNA methylation biomarkers and contribute to the improvement of cancer detection in a clinical setting.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2015126"
"cr","Direct conversion of astrocytes into neuronal cells by drug cocktail","Neurological disorder is one of the greatest threats to public health according to the World Health Organization. Because neurons have little or no regenerative capacity, conventional therapies for neurological disorders yielded poor outcomes. While the introduction of exogenous neural stem cells or neurons holds promise, many challenges still need to be tackled, including cell resource, delivery strategy, cell integration and cell maturation. Reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells or directly into desirable neuronal cells by transcription factors (TFs) or small molecules can solve some problems, but other issues remain to be addressed, including safety, conversion efficiency and epigenetic memory1,2.Astrocytes are considered to be the ideal starting candidate cell type for generating new neurons, due to their proximity in lineage distance to neurons and ability to proliferate after brain damage. Many studies have already revealed that astrocytes of the central nervous system can be reprogrammed into induced neuronal cells by virus-mediated overexpression of specific TFs in vitro and in vivo3,4,5,6. However, application of this virus-mediated direct conversion is still limited due to concerns on clinical safety. We have previously reported direct conversion of somatic cells into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in vitro by cocktail of small molecules under hypoxia7. Here we set out to explore whether astrocytes can be induced into neuronal cells by the chemical cocktail in vitro.We first isolated astrocytes from 1-day postnatal mouse brain. To exclude contamination of neuronal cells and NPCs in primary astrocytes, we strictly followed the isolation protocol and used cells passaged at least three times in each experiment. Moreover, retrovirus-mediated delivery of GFAP::GFP reporters into these cells, which selectively label proliferative astrocytes, but not neuronal cells, further confirmed the purity of astrocytes (Supplementary information, Figure S1A-S1D)3. Then we treated cultured astrocytes with the chemical cocktail VCR (V, VPA, 3 mM; C, CHIR99021, 3 μM; R, Repsox, 1 μM). The same cocktail reported in our previous study7 was used here with slight modification, such as the optimized VPA concentration. Briefly, astrocytes cultured in astrocyte medium for 48 h were transferred into DMEM/F12 medium that contains the VCR cocktail and other supplements including B27, N2, 20 ng/ml BDNF and 20 ng/ml GDNF. The VCR-containing medium was changed every 4 days. After 8 days under VCR treatment, cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium (containing 400 ng/ml shh, 100 ng/ml FGF8, 10 ng/ml bFGF, 20 μM L-Ascorbic acid, 20 ng/ml BDNF, 20 ng/ml GDNF, B27 and N2) without the cocktail under hypoxia. Astrocytes were added to fill the blank and support the development of induced neuronal cells when necessary. Obviously, VCR treatment changed the cell morphology from astrocyte- into neuronal cell-like morphology, as shown by the phase contrast images (Figure 1A). Importantly, cultured mouse astrocytes can be induced into DCX+ neuroblasts (Figure 1B) and Tuj1+ or NeuN+ neurons (Figure 1C) 12 days and 18 days post induction, respectively. Quantification of conversion efficiency showed that DCX+ cells appeared as early as 3 days post induction, and the number of DCX+ cells peaked on day 12 and then slightly decreased. In contrast, NeuN+ cells were detectable from day 6 and their number gradually increased afterwards (Supplementary information, Figure S1E). The dynamic alteration in expression of neuronal cell markers in a continuous process reinforces the idea that induced neuronal cells are generated from starting astrocytes. Importantly, we observed that mature neurons induced from cultured astrocytes fired repetitive trains of action potentials and exhibited postsynaptic current spontaneously (Figure 1D-1F). During the whole conversion process from astrocytes to neuronal cells, we did not observe emergence of Sox2+ NPCs (Supplementary information, Figure S2A and S2B). Moreover, NPCs were also absent even when astrocytes were cultured under the same condition used for NPC induction from fibroblasts7.Figure 1Cultured astrocytes are induced into neuronal cells by small molecules. (A) Cultured astrocytes showed neuronal morphology 12 days post VCR induction (DPI, days post induction). GFP+ cells stand for astrocytes labelled by GFAP::GFP. (B) Cultured astrocytes were converted into DCX+ neuoroblasts 12 days post VCR induction. (C) Neuronal cells converted from astrocytes expressed mature neuron markers Tuj1 and NeuN 18 days post VCR treatment. (D) Patch-clamp recording was conducted on VCR-induced neurons from cultured astrocytes identified by fluorescence 26 days post induction.

(H) Heat map depicting the relative fold changes of gene expression levels in astrocytes 1 week after chemical treatment in vitro. The value in the color bar indicates log2 changes (relative to HPRT and normalized to ctrl). (I, J) DCX+, Tuj1+ and NeuN+ cells were generated from cultured astrocytes under treatment of the drug cocktail VT. Data are presented as mean ± SEM; scale bar, 10 μm.Full size imageTo tease out critical constituent(s) enabling astrocytic-to-neuronal transition within the chemical cocktail, we conducted screens by removing one or two component(s) from the cocktail. Elimination of VPA significantly abolished the generation of neuroblasts from astrocytes, whereas the exclusion of CHIR99021 or Repsox had minimal effect on neuroblast induction under our culturing conditions. Interestingly, conversion induced by VR (VPA and Repsox) was as efficient as that by the VCR cocktail. In contrast, VPA alone was able to induce astrocytes into neuroblasts with lower efficiency compared with VR, while neither CHIR99021 or Repsox alone nor their combination produced any induced neuroblasts (Supplementary information, Figure S1F and S1G). Later these chemical-induced neuroblasts developed into mature neurons expressing NeuN with diverse efficiencies (Supplementary information, Figure S1H). Calculation of DCX+ or NeuN+ cell proportion in the final population (Figure 1G) or conversion efficiency (neuronal marker-positive cell number/initial cell number; Supplementary information, Figure S1I) at different time points clearly demonstrates that the critical chemical components in VCR are VPA and Repsox. Mature neurons of specific types were also generated from astrocytes 25 days post VR induction, including dopaminergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, glutamatergic neurons and motor neurons (Supplementary information, Figure S1J-S1N). The glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor CHIR99021 has been reported to strongly enhance NeuroD1 expression in NPCs, which leads to neuronal differentiation from NPCs8. However, CHIR99021 did not activate NeuroD1 expression or facilitate neuronal conversion in our system, which also excludes the possibility of contamination and generation of NPCs here. In addition, we did not find any chemical component in VCR or their combination that contributed to proliferation of the starting cells or neurons, further excluding the possibility of neuron contamination in starting cells (Supplementary information, Figure S2C-S2E).To analyze the potential underling mechanisms, we first checked the expression of TFs including NeuroG2, NeuroD1, Ascl1, Pax6, Dlx2 and Sox2, each of which has been reported to sufficiently reprogram astrocytes into neuronal cells9. Surprisingly, no chemical or chemical cocktail was able to activate Ascl1, Dlx2, Sox2 and Pax6 expression. Cocktails containing VPA or even VPA alone could significantly activate the expression of NeuroG2 and NeuroD1 (Figure 1H). Among these two TFs, NeuroD1-induced astrocytic-to-neural conversion was also confirmed in our system (Supplementary information, Figure S2F and S2G). These two TFs contain the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) DNA-binding domain. Since Notch signaling regulates bHLH factors as a conserved module and also regulates neurogenic program of astrocytes after brain stroke10, we next investigated the expression pattern of genes involved in this pathway. However, treatment with the chemical(s) did not cause any significant change in the expression of Notch receptors 1/2/3/4 and Notch ligands Dll1/3/4, Jagged1/2 and Hes1/5 (Supplementary information, Figure S2H and Table S1). Based on these findings, we suggest that chemicals capable of inducing astrocytic-to-neuronal transition might act by inducing NeuroG2 and NeuroD1 expression independently of Notch signaling.Our previous study showed that components of chemical cocktails capable of inducing cell reprogramming can be substituted with other small molecules targeting the same signaling pathway7. Thus, we wonder whether it is possible to replace chemicals in the cocktail with pharmaceutical compounds, which might be directly applied in vivo for translational medicine. The reduced-chemical cocktail VR contains VPA and Repsox that can inhibit histone deacetylases and TGF-β signaling, respectively. We kept VPA (an anticonvulsant and mood-stabilizing drug), replaced Repsox by another TGF-β inhibitor Tranilast (T, an antiallergic drug, 100 μM), and then tested the neuronal induction capacity of this new drug cocktail (termed as VT). As expected, DCX+ cells were generated from cultured astrocytes 12 days post induction using VT (Figure 1I). Neurons expressing Tuj1 or NeuN were also observed 18 days post induction (Figure 1J). Consistently, VT also significantly activated expression of NeuroG2 and NeuroD1 in astrocytes under the conversion conditions (Supplementary information, Figure S2I).In summary, our results demonstrate that small molecules can directly convert astrocytes into neurons in vitro through activation of NeuroG2 and NeuroD1 expression. Using small molecules to manipulate this cell fate transition can be an attractive approach for clinical application. Importantly, we also found that the chemical cocktail VCR can enable astrocytes of adult mice to acquire neuronal cell properties in vitro (Supplementary information, Figure S2J-S2L), suggesting the practical implication of such chemical-induced conversion in vivo. The potential effects of these chemicals on other types of cells, such as neurons, need to be systematically and carefully evaluated in the future. Nevertheless, local delivery of small molecules or systematic administration of drug cocktail enabling astrocytic-to-neuronal conversion might achieve direct induction of desirable cells from resident astrocytes in situ to meet the ultimate goal of regenerative medicine.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2015120"
"cr","NF-YB1-regulated expression of sucrose transporters in aleurone facilitates sugar loading to rice endosperm","Cereal endosperms, which consist of an outer aleurone layer and an inner starchy endosperm, provide over 70% staple food for human [www.fao.org]. Rice endosperm development occurs in the caryopsis of a grain. During the grain filling stage, sucrose produced in photosynthetic leaves is transported to grains via the phloem1,2. It has been proposed that sucrose, upon arrival in the caryopsis through the phloem located at the dorsal vascular bundle, is partially hydrolyzed by cell wall invertases (CINs) into glucose and fructose3,4. Since endosperm is symplastically isolated from maternal tissues, it is assumed that these sugars are delivered to the endosperm actively through an apoplastic pathway by sugar transporters located in aleurone5,6. However, the exact role of aleurone in regulating sugar transport remains unknown.In this study, microarray analyses were performed in rice (Oryza sativa L., Zhonghua 11) to identify transcription factors (TFs) differentially expressed between starchy endosperm and aleurone in caryopses collected at 11 to 14 days after pollination (DAP), a stage when grain filling is active. Out of 949 TFs that were differentially expressed, 505 were up-regulated in the aleurone. Real-time PCR was performed to examine their expression patterns further. Os02g0725900 encoding Nuclear Factor Y B1 (NF-YB1) was shown to be expressed in caryopses from 4 to 21 DAP (c4 to c21), similar to the result published recently7, while no expression was detected in vegetative tissues examined (Figure 1A). Within caryopses, abundant NF-YB1 expression was detected in mixed aleurone-testa sample (a+t), but not in starchy endosperm (se; Figure 1A).Figure 1NF-YB1-regulated expression of three sucrose transporters facilitates grain filling in rice. (A) Real-time PCR analysis showing that NF-YB1 is expressed in caryopses at 4, 7, 11, 14 and 21 DAP; and in caryopses collected at 11 DAP, NF-YB1 is highly expressed in mixed aleurone and testa tissues. l, leaves; r, roots; p, panicles; o, ovaries; c2 to c31, caryopses collected at 2 to 31 DAP; se and a+t, starchy endosperm and mixed aleurone and testa samples collected at 11 DAP, respectively.

(G) Expression levels of SUT1, SUT3, SUT4 and MST4 were reduced in nfyb1-1 caryopses collected at 5 DAP, as compared to those in WT. Expression levels of these genes in the WT were normalized to 1.

DP, dorsal phloem; PC, parenchyma cells in the vascular bundle; NP, nucellar projection; DA, dorsal aleurone; SE, starchy endosperm; SP, symplastic; AP, apoplastic; suc, sucrose; glu, glucose; fru, fructose.Full size imageNF-YB1 belongs to NF-Y family TFs that are conserved in all eukaryotic organisms. NF-Ys usually form trimers with one NF-YA, one NF-YB and one NF-YC, and bind to CCAAT-containing regulatory elements8. Ten NF-YAs, eleven NF-YBs and seven NF-YCs are present in the rice genome, which could potentially produce over 700 heterotrimeric complexes8.In situ hybridization showed that, during caryopsis development, expression of NF-YB1 was first detected at the periphery of coenocytic endosperms at 4 DAP, and confined to dorsal aleurone (adjacent to the primary vascular bundle and nucellar projection) at 5 DAP, and then expanded to the whole aleurone at 7, 9 and 11 DAP (stronger at the dorsal side). No expression was observed in maternal tissues such as the dorsal vascular bundle and the nucellar projection (Figure 1B and Supplementary information, Figure S1A). The expression correlated with the rapid increase of fresh caryopsis weight during this period (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). GUS staining in transgenic plants carrying 3 018 base pairs (bp) of NF-YB1 5′ upstream sequence fused to β-Glucuronidase (GUS) confirmed the expression pattern, and revealed no GUS expression in any other tissues examined (Supplementary information, Figure S1C). These results together suggest NF-YB1 is specifically expressed in aleurone.Two CRISPR-Cas9 constructs expressing guide RNAs targeting different regions of the second exon of NF-YB1 were made and used to transform into rice (Zhonghua 11). Sequencing of PCR-amplified NF-YB1 genomic DNA from transgenic plants allowed us to identify two knockout mutants: nfyb1-1 with an adenine insertion and nfyb1-2 with a thymine insertion into the second exon (Figure 1C and Supplementary information, Figure S2A), predicted to produce truncated polypeptides with only 16 and 34 amino acids (AA) identical to NF-YB1 in nfyb1-1 and nfyb1-2, respectively (Supplementary information, Figure S2B). Although no visible phenotype was observed during vegetative growth, grains produced from homozygous nfyb1-1 and nfyb1-2 plants showed a chalky endosperm phenotype, suggesting a defect in grain filling (Figure 1D). Additionally, an RNA interference (RNAi) construct with a 350-bp fragment targeting the second exon of NF-YB1, expressed under the control of maize Ubiquitin 1 promoter, was made and transformed into rice (Zhonghua 11). Caryopses excised from 3 independent transgenic lines showed reduced NF-YB1 expression (Supplementary information, Figure S2C) and a similar chalky endosperm phenotype as nfyb1-1 and nfyb1-2 (Supplementary information, Figure S2D). These data together suggest that NF-YB1 plays an important role in rice grain filling.Since nfyb1-1 and nfyb1-2 showed indistinguishable phenotype, nfyb1-1 was thus used in subsequent experiments. The mature nfyb1-1 caryopsis showed 18% reduction in dry weight (Supplementary information, Figure S2E). Scanning electron microscopy examinations revealed that endosperms in nfyb1-1 carried small and loosely packed starch granules, which differed markedly from the large and tightly packed starch granules in the wildtype (WT; Figure 1E). The average length of nfyb1-1 starch granules along the long axes was 4.4 ± 0.6 μm, as compared with 7.8 ± 1.0 μm in the WT (Supplementary information, Figure S2F). Gas chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC-QQQ-MS/MS) analyses showed that contents of sucrose, fructose and glucose in nfyb1-1 caryopses collected at 6, 9 and 11 DAP were significantly reduced as compared to those in the WT (Figure 1F). These data suggest that the chalky endosperm phenotype in nfyb1-1 might be caused by compromised sugar delivery.We then examined expression patterns of genes involved in sugar loading in nfyb1-1. All five Sucrose Transporters (SUTs, 1 to 5) in the rice genome, CIN2 and Monosaccharide Transporter 4 (MST4) are known to be expressed at different stages of rice caryopses9,4,10. Real-time PCR performed in caryopses collected at 5 DAP showed that levels of SUT1, SUT3, SUT4 and MST4 expression were reduced in nfyb1-1, while no evident reduction was observed for SUT2 (Figure 1G), suggesting that SUT1, SUT3, SUT4 and MST4 may be regulated by NF-YB1.To address if NF-YB1 can bind to regulatory elements of these sugar transporter genes, yeast one-hybrid experiment was performed using NF-YB1 fused with GAL4 transcriptional activation domain as prey, and 5′ upstream sequences of SUT1, SUT3, SUT4, MST4 or SUT2 fused to LacZ as baits. After co-transformation of the prey with individual baits into yeast, we observed that NF-YB1 is able to activate LacZ expression when SUT1, SUT3, SUT4 or MST4 5′ sequences were used, while no activation was detected for SUT2 (Figure 1H).To further address if NF-YB1 is able to activate expression of these sugar transporters in plants, luciferase (LUC) assay was performed in vitro using protoplasts isolated from etiolated rice seedlings by co-transformation of p35S::NF-YB1::tNOS with either pSUT1::LUC, pSUT3::LUC, pSUT4::LUC, pMST4::LUC or pSUT2::LUC. As showed in Figure 1I, significantly elevated LUC activities were detected when pSUT1::LUC, pSUT3::LUC and pSUT4::LUC were used, while no significant elevation was observed for pMST4::LUC and pSUT2::LUC, indicating MST4 and SUT2 might not be direct targets of NF-YB1.Several putative CCAAT boxes were identified in 5′ upstream sequences of SUT1, SUT3 and SUT4 (Supplementary information, Data S1). To elucidate if NF-YB1 is able to bind to these boxes, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed using His-NF-YB1 produced in E. coli (Supplementary information, Data S1). As shown in Figure 1J, bands with retarded migrations were observed when SUT1, SUT3 or SUT4 upstream sequences were incubated with His-NF-YB1. The bands disappeared (SUT1 and SUT3) or became significantly weakened (SUT4) when excess competitive probes were added. These results together suggest that NF-YB1 is able to bind to CCAAT boxes of SUT1, SUT3 and SUT4.Previous studies have shown that SUT1 is expressed in aleurone, dorsal vascular bundle, nucellar projection and nucellar epidermis11, and SUT4 in aleurone and the embryo12. In situ hybridization performed in this study showed that SUT3 was expressed specifically in the dorsal aleurone. No expression was detected in maternal pericarp and testa tissues, nor in the starchy endosperm (Supplementary information, Figure S2G). Co-expression of NF-YB1 with SUT1, SUT3 and SUT4 in aleurone is consistent with the possibility that they form part of a regulatory module.In summary, the aleurone-specific NF-YB1, with stronger expression at the dorsal side, plays an important role in regulating rice grain filling through activating the expression of SUT1, SUT3 and SUT4. It has been shown in several cereal crops that phloem in the dorsal vascular bundle, to which the dorsal aleurone and nucellar projection adjoin, is the primary route for sucrose delivery from leaves to developing endosperms13,14. Current hypothesis suggests that sucrose is partially hydrolyzed to glucose and fructose by CINs expressed in the dorsal vascular bundle region, and move first symplastically through maternal phloem parenchyma and nucellar projection through plasmadesmata, and then apoplastically to the filial endosperm by sugar transporters located in aleurone transfer cells2,5,6. Results provided in this study showed that the expression of SUT1, SUT3 and SUT4 in rice aleurone is regulated in concert by NF-YB1. Knockout or down-regulation of NF-YB1 led to defective grains with chalky endosperms. Similar grain-filling phenotype has been observed in rice when CIN2/GIF1 or SUT1 is mutated or down-regulated4,15. We showed further using yeast one-hybrid, LUC assay and EMSA experiments that NF-YB1 binds specifically to 5′ regulatory sequences of SUT1, SUT3 and SUT4. As expected, expression of these genes was down-regulated in nfyb1-1 caryopses. It is noted that SUT1 and SUT4 are expressed in a much broader pattern than NF-YB1. We reckon that the aleurone-specifically expressed NF-YB1 may form a trimeric complex with an unknown NF-FA and NF-YC to regulate the expression of these three SUTs in aleurone, while the expression of these SUTs in other tissues could be regulated by different NF-Y complexes, or other families of TFs. A model is thus proposed to illustrate the role of rice NF-YB1 in regulating sucrose loading to the developing endosperm for starch biosynthesis through transcriptional activation of SUT1, SUT3 and SUT4 in aleurone (Figure 1K). This route may act in parallel with the glucose and fructose loadings that are mediated by CINs and MSTs. Further studies on this molecular module may deepen our understanding of cereal grain filling in general, and could potentially contribute to improving crop yield.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2015116"
"cr","G protein-coupled receptor 183 facilitates endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition via Notch1 inhibition","In vertebrates, embryonic hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) are derived from a subset of endothelial cells, the hemogenic endothelium (HE), through the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT). Notch signaling is essential for HSPC development during embryogenesis across vertebrates. However, whether and how it regulates EHT remains unclear. Here, we show that G protein-coupled receptor 183 (Gpr183) signaling serves as an indispensable switch for HSPC emergence by repressing Notch signaling before the onset of EHT. Inhibition of Gpr183 significantly upregulates Notch signaling and abolishes HSPC emergence. Upon activation by its ligand 7α-25-OHC, Gpr183 recruits β-arrestin1 and the E3 ligase Nedd4 to degrade Notch1 in specified HE cells and then facilitates the subsequent EHT. Importantly, 7α-25-OHC stimulation promotes HSPC emergence in vivo and in vitro, providing an attractive strategy for enhancing the in vitro generation of functional HSPCs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2015109"
"cr","Acute inflammation stimulates a regenerative response in the neonatal mouse heart","Cardiac injury in neonatal 1-day-old mice stimulates a regenerative response characterized by reactive cardiomyocyte proliferation, which is distinguished from the fibrotic repair process in adults. Acute inflammation occurs immediately after heart injury and has generally been believed to exert a negative effect on heart regeneration by promoting scar formation in adults; however, little is known about the role of acute inflammation in the cardiac regenerative response in neonatal mice. Here, we show that acute inflammation induced cardiomyocyte proliferation after apical intramyocardial microinjection of immunogenic zymosan A particles into the neonatal mouse heart. We also found that cardiac injury-induced regenerative response was suspended after immunosuppression in neonatal mice, and that cardiomyocytes could not be reactivated to proliferate after neonatal heart injury in the absence of interleukin-6 (IL-6). Furthermore, cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), the major downstream effector of IL-6 signaling, decreased reactive cardiomyocyte proliferation after apical resection. Our results indicate that acute inflammation stimulates the regenerative response in neonatal mouse heart, and suggest that modulation of inflammatory signals might have important implications in cardiac regenerative medicine.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2015110"
"cr","Development of the anterior-posterior axis is a self-organizing process in the absence of maternal cues in the mouse embryo","Establishment of the anterior-posterior (AP) axis in the mouse embryo is crucial for proper induction of the germ layers. Despite this importance, it is unclear whether specification of the AP axis is an autonomous process or if it requires an embryonic-maternal interaction at the time of implantation. By embryonic day 5.5 (E5.5), the combined activities of Nodal, GDF3 and the Cripto co-receptor generate a proximal-distal gradient that establishes a signaling center at the distal tip of the embryo ― the distal visceral endoderm (DVE). This proximo-distal asymmetry is transformed into the AP axis as the DVE cells migrate. DVE cells express the Nodal antagonists, Lefty1 and Cer1, which specify the anterior identity of the underlying epiblast1. The expression of these key DVE markers is already triggered before implantation2,3,4. Cells that express Lefty1 and Cer1 in the late blastocyst contribute to DVE formation, together with cells that acquire de novo Cer1 and Lefty1 expression after implantation3,4,5. This pre-implantation expression of the Nodal antagonists led to the suggestion that the DVE, and therefore the AP axis, arise independently of any interaction between mother and embryo.However, recently an alternative mechanism was proposed. By growing early post-implantation embryos in gels of different agarose concentrations Hiramatsu et al.6 found that DVE is established only in stiffer gels, concluding that in vivo the maternal tissues should exert similar mechanical forces to enable DVE formation. Moreover, this biomechanical stress was reported to result in the transmigration of epiblast cells into the visceral endoderm (VE), which were suggested to generate the DVE at the distal tip. Therefore, two fundamentally different concepts about the mother's role in AP axis specification are currently considered.To resolve whether establishment of the AP axis depends on mother-embryo interactions, or if it is an embryo-autonomous process, we performed a series of embryo culture and lineage tracing experiments. We used a Cer1-GFP line, previously established as a faithful DVE reporter6,7, to monitor DVE formation and migration directly in living embryos.First, we recovered embryos before implantation, at E3.5, and monitored their development and DVE formation through implantation stages in vitro on plastic plates, as we previously described5,8,9. Cer1-expressing cells became detectable after 1-1.5 day of culture and as development progressed they consolidated at the distal tip to establish the DVE (Supplementary information, Figure S1A, S1B and Movie S1). To capture the dynamics of DVE formation, we imaged pre- to post-implantation morphogenesis by time-lapse microscopy (Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Movie S2). We analyzed 66 embryos and found that 87.8% established a Cer1-expression domain during the in vitro culture: in 58.3% it was positioned asymmetrically, and in 29.5% it remained located distally. Only in 12.2% of the embryos a Cer1-expression domain was not detectable (Supplementary information, Figure S1C and S1D). The migratory Cer1-expressing cells assembled into string-like configurations, extending in a distal-to-proximal direction (Supplementary information, Figure S1E). We analyzed 39 divisions of Cer1-expressing cells in seven in vitro developing embryos, of which 69.9% were parallel to the direction of migration (Supplementary information, Figure S1E-S1G), suggesting that proliferating DVE cells become organized due to their pattern of divisions and migratory properties.Figure 1Mouse embryos autonomously establish the AP axis.

Scale bars: A-C and F, 50 μm; G and H, 100 μm.Full size imageNext, we asked whether peri-implantation embryos (E5.0) could also establish the DVE in the absence of interactions with the mother. We analyzed the development of 59 E5.0 embryos and found that after 1 day of culture, 86% of them established a Cer1-expression domain: in 74.5% it was positioned asymmetrically and in 11.5%, it was located distally. Only 14% of the embryos lacked detectable Cer1 expression (Figure 1B, Supplementary information, Figure S2A-S2C, S2I, and S2J). Time-lapse microscopy confirmed the emergence of Cer1-expressing cells that extruded filopodia-like protrusions during their migration (Supplementary information, Figure S2K and Movie S3). As controls, we cultured 66 E5.5 embryos that had already established the DVE in utero by that stage in 87.9% of cases (Supplementary information, Figure S2D-S2F). Upon culture, the Cer1-expression domain moved asymmetrically in 81.3% of embryos (Supplementary information, Figure S2G, S2H and S2J). These observations were confirmed using another DVE reporter Lefty1(mVenus)2. Both E5.0 and E5.5 Lefty1(mVenus) embryos established asymmetric Lefty1 expression during 24 h of culture, without the requirement of external biomechanical pressure (Supplementary information, Figure S3A-S3C).To investigate whether DVE establishment and migration are influenced by substrate stiffness, as recently proposed6, we followed the methodology reported by Hiramatsu et al. and cultured 146 E5.0 embryos in gels of various agarose concentrations: 0% (n = 23 embryos), 0.1% (n = 26), 0.3% (n = 22), 0.5% (n = 25), 0.8% (n = 28) and 1% agarose (n = 22; Figure 1C). Atomic force microscopy indentation measurements of the gels yielded Young's moduli of 3820 ± 100 Pa (mean ± SEM) for 1% w/v agarose, 990 ± 80 Pa for 0.8% w/v agarose, and 190 ± 10 Pa for 0.5% w/v agarose (Figure 1D). We found that in all agarose concentrations embryos were able to establish a Cer1-expression domain that migrated asymmetrically (Figure 1C and 1E). Moreover, embryos cultured under all of these conditions grew and elongated to similar extents (Supplementary information, Figure S4A).To exclude any possibility that interaction of the embryo with the substrate provides a mechanical stimulus leading to DVE formation, we cultured embryos free-floating in hanging drops of medium. We first cultured 40 E5.0 embryos, from which the majority (75.8%, n = 40) established a Cer1-expression domain and in 60.7% of cases this domain translocated anteriorly (Figure 1F, Supplementary information, Figure S4B and S4C). To determine whether the DVE is established in free-floating embryos from an even earlier stage, we cultured blastocysts in hanging drops. Again the majority of embryos (77.2%, n = 42) developed into egg cylinders that established a Cer1-expression domain and in 54.3% of embryos this domain translocated anteriorly (Supplementary information, Figure S4D-S4E).Together, these experiments demonstrate that the DVE can form and migrate without a requirement of external spatial restriction on the embryo. These results are consistent in all experimental conditions irrespective of whether the embryos developed on a plastic substrate, in gels of varying stiffness or in hanging drops.It has also been proposed that physical constriction of the embryo leads to transmigration of epiblast cells into VE to generate the DVE6. Since our results strongly indicate that DVE can form without any need of physical constriction, we next sought to determine whether the epiblast transmigration is essential for DVE formation. To this end, we used Rainbow transgenic mice10 in combination with mice carrying a Sox2Cre transgene11 to follow individual genetically labelled epiblast cells.The first labelled epiblast cells in a color other than the default red were detected at E4.75 (n = 7; Figure 1G). While analyzing Rainbow-Sox2Cre embryos, we found that when the proamniotic cavity starts expansion (E5.25), a small proportion of embryos had cells of epiblast origin in the VE. We analyzed 33 embryos recovered at E5.25-E5.75 and found that 33% had epiblast-originating cells in VE (Figure 1H and 1I). On average, two cells of epiblast-origin were present in the VE per embryo (Figure 1J). Such cells in an embryo were the same color and usually in close proximity to each other, suggesting that they were sister cells. In two cases two non-adjacent cells of different colors were found in the VE (Figure 1Hd), raising the possibility that the epiblast can contribute to VE on more than one occasion in the same embryo. The position of epiblast-originating cells was not skewed to a particular site in the embryo: in three cases, epiblast-originating cells in the VE were in close proximity to the embryonic-extra-embryonic junction; in five cases, in the lateral part of the VE; and in four cases, at the distal tip (Figure 1K (in vivo)). A similar situation was observed at E6.5, where 4 out of 16 embryos had epiblast-originating cells in VE (29%, Figure 1I). As with E5.25-E5.75 embryos, E6.5 embryos had an average of two epiblast-originating cells in the VE that were of the same color and always in the lateral part of the VE (Figure 1J). The presence of epiblast-originating cells in the VE suggests that epiblast cells transmigrate as the embryo develops. To test that, we filmed the in vitro development of Rainbow-Sox2Cre embryos recovered at E5.25 or E5.75 by time-lapse microscopy. In 14 filmed embryos, we found 6 in which epiblast cells transmigrated into the VE at random positions (Figure 1K (post-IVC), Supplementary information, Figure S5A and S5B).Finally, to determine whether the epiblast-to-VE transmigration could occur in the absence of any physical influence of the maternal environment, we filmed the in vitro development of blastocysts into egg cylinders (n = 14). As the pro-amniotic cavity started expansion, a single epiblast cell transmigrated into the VE in half of observed embryos (Figure 1L, Supplementary information, Figure S5A and Movie S4). These transmigrated cells became embedded at different positions in the VE or excluded from the embryo and in none of the cases contributed to the DVE (Figure 1K (pre-post-IVC) and 1L).These results demonstrate that the epiblast-to-VE transmigration does take place, which is in agreement with the recent report6. However, the results we present here indicate that the epiblast-to-VE transmigration occurs not just at the distal tip, but in random positions along the egg cylinder, and that it is not required for DVE formation.In a series of embryo culture experiments in different environmental conditions we show here that the AP axis in the mouse embryo can be specified in the absence of embryo-maternal interaction and without any external constraint. These findings contradict the suggestion that maternal tissues are essential to exert mechanical forces that enable DVE formation6. In the previous study, the authors report that it is necessary to encase embryos in an agarose gel in order to induce DVE formation in vitro. Moreover, gels containing less than 0.5% agarose were described as unable to support embryo elongation and DVE formation, contrary to our observations. How might the differences between these results arise? One possibility is the method of embryo culture. Whereas medium containing rat serum was used by Hiramatsu et al., here we culture embryos in a serum-free medium. Initially we attempted a similar embryo culture approach reported by Hiramatsu et al.; however we were unable to obtain a batch of rat serum of sufficient quality to support normal embryo growth (data not shown). To overcome this obstacle, we used the chemically defined IVC2 medium that we have recently established, which supports embryonic development beyond the blastocyst stage8,9. It is possible that the defined medium has an advantage over the serum-containing media as it excludes variability between batches of serum and the possibility of supplying growth factors and morphogens found in serum that might influence the outcome of the culture. Therefore, our results indicate that if satisfactory culture conditions are provided, the DVE can be specified outside the maternal environment in the absence of external pressure. Together, our results suggest that the processes by which the DVE forms and migrates to set up the AP axis are embryo-autonomous, illustrating the self-organizational properties of the mouse embryo.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2015104"
"cr","Direct reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes with chemical cocktails","The direct conversion, or transdifferentiation, of non-cardiac cells into cardiomyocytes by forced expression of transcription factors and microRNAs provides promising approaches for cardiac regeneration. However, genetic manipulations raise safety concerns and are thus not desirable in most clinical applications. The discovery of full chemically induced pluripotent stem cells suggest the possibility of replacing transcription factors with chemical cocktails. Here, we report the generation of automatically beating cardiomyocyte-like cells from mouse fibroblasts using only chemical cocktails. These chemical-induced cardiomyocyte-like cells (CiCMs) express cardiomyocyte-specific markers, exhibit sarcomeric organization, and possess typical cardiac calcium flux and electrophysiological features. Genetic lineage tracing confirms the fibroblast origin of these CiCMs. Further studies show the generation of CiCMs passes through a cardiac progenitor stage instead of a pluripotent stage. Bypassing the use of viral-derived factors, this proof of concept study lays a foundation for in vivo cardiac transdifferentiation with pharmacological agents and possibly safer treatment of heart failure.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201599"
"cr","A miR-130a-YAP positive feedback loop promotes organ size and tumorigenesis","Organ size determination is one of the most intriguing unsolved mysteries in biology. Aberrant activation of the major effector and transcription co-activator YAP in the Hippo pathway causes drastic organ enlargement in development and underlies tumorigenesis in many human cancers. However, how robust YAP activation is achieved during organ size control remains elusive. Here we report that the YAP signaling is sustained through a novel microRNA-dependent positive feedback loop. miR-130a, which is directly induced by YAP, could effectively repress VGLL4, an inhibitor of YAP activity, thereby amplifying the YAP signals. Inhibition of miR-130a reversed liver size enlargement induced by Hippo pathway inactivation and blocked YAP-induced tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the Drosophila Hippo pathway target bantam functionally mimics miR-130a by repressing the VGLL4 homolog SdBP/Tgi. These findings reveal an evolutionarily conserved positive feedback mechanism underlying robustness of the Hippo pathway in size control and tumorigenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201598"
"cr","Bromodeoxyuridine promotes full-chemical induction of mouse pluripotent stem cells","Direct reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with transcription factors (e.g., Oct4 (O), Sox2 (S), Klf4 (K), and c-Myc (M)) greatly expands our understanding of cell fate control. iPSCs resemble embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but without immune rejection and ethic issues, and are therefore considered as a promising source for cell replacement therapy. Patient-derived iPSCs can also be differentiated into disease-associated cell types and be used for drug screening1. However, iPSC applications are hindered by safety concerns about the possible genetic alterations caused by the use of exogenous pluripotency-associated factors. Many efforts have been taken to make iPSCs more amendable in clinical applications by using non-integrating gene delivery approaches2, or cell membrane-permeable proteins3,4 to induce the reprogramming.Small-molecule compounds have also been found to be extremely useful in facilitating iPSC generation and can replace several reprogramming factors5. Several combinations of small-molecule compounds have been reported to allow iPSC generation with only Oct46,7. However, complete chemical-mediated reprogramming of somatic cells into the pluripotent state has been proved to be extremely difficult. To date, only one study reported a seven- or four-chemical cocktail that can induce reprogramming8. Here we report that the commonly used biological reagent, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), is able to enhance Yamanaka factor-mediated reprogramming. More interestingly, BrdU can replace Oct4, the most critical factor in iPSC generation. Further studies demonstrate that BrdU promotes full-chemical induction of mouse iPSCs using several chemical cocktails, with the minimal combination being BrdU, CHIR99021, Repsox, and Forskolin. These iPSCs resemble ESCs in terms of their gene expression, epigenetic status, in vivo differentiation potentials and the ability to generate chimera.We have previously established a 96-well plate-based screening system (Supplementary information, Figure S1A) for chemicals that could affect OSKM-induced reprogramming of OG2 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) stably carrying an Oct4 promoter-driven GFP reporter. Using this system we identified both LiCl and high osmotic pressure could enhance OSKM-mediated reprogramming of MEFs9,10. Unexpectedly, we also discovered that BrdU, a synthetic nucleoside that is an analog of thymidine and is commonly used in tracing DNA replication, was able to facilitate OSKM-induced reprogramming. About 40 GFP+ colonies could be observed in BrdU-treated wells (starting from 4 000 MEFs/well), while only 1-2 colonies could be observed in the control well (Figure 1A and 1B). We treated the OSKM-infected MEFs with BrdU for various durations starting from day 3, 6 or 9 post infection (Supplementary information, Figure S1B and S1C). BrdU displayed remarkable effect at the early stage of reprogramming (Supplementary information, Figure S1B) and showed maximum effect if its treatment was maintained from day 3 to day 7 (Supplementary information, Figure S1C). BrdU could not maintain self-renewal of mESCs in LIF-free condition, and in the presence of LIF, BrdU even induced differentiation of mESCs (Supplementary information, Figure S1D). This explained why prolonged treatment of BrdU actually reduced the number of iPSC clones (Supplementary information, Figure S1C). Interestingly, the most effective concentration of BrdU in promoting reprogramming seems to vary according to the starting density of MEFs. The lower the starting MEF density, the lower the most effective concentration of BrdU (Supplementary information, Figure S1E). BrdU not only increased the number of GFP+ cells, but also speeded up the reprogramming process. GFP+ cells could be observed in BrdU-treated group as early as day 7 by FACS analysis (Supplementary information, Figure S1F), and more than 30% cells were GFP+ on day 14 in BrdU group.Figure 1BrdU promotes full-chemical induced reprogramming of MEFs.

MEFs and an OSMK-clone were used as controls. (K) DNA methylation profile of the Oct4 and Nanog promoters in 4B-CiPSC clone #6 (4B-CiPSC-6). E14 mESCs and MEFs were used as controls. (L) GFP expression, colony morphology, AP staining and immunofluorescence staining of pluripotency markers Nanog and SSEA-1 in 4B-CiPSC-6. Scale bar, 50 μm. (M) H&E stained sections of teratoma formed by 4B-CiPSC-6. Scale bar, 50 μm. (N) Chimeric mice generated with 4B-CiPSC-6.Full size imageTo confirm the pluripotency of iPSCs generated with the OSKM and BrdU method, a series of iPSC lines were established. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed the reactivation of the endogenous Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Rex1 and the silencing of viral genes in these iPSC lines (Supplementary information, Figure S2A and S2B). These iPSCs maintained GFP expression and ESC-like morphology, and expressed pluripotency markers, including alkaline phosphatase, Nanog, and SSEA1 (Supplementary information, Figure S2C). Subcutaneous injection of the iPSCs into NOD-SCID mice led to teratoma formation in 4 weeks, with tissues derived from three germ layers (Supplementary information, Figure S2D). We also injected the iPSCs into the ICR blastocysts and chimeric mice were successfully obtained (Supplementary information, Figure S2E).Next we tested whether BrdU could enhance reprogramming with reduced numbers of transcription factors. BrdU was found to enhance reprogramming of MEFs induced by OSK (Figure 1C) or OK plus a chemical cocktail (3 μM CHIR99021 and 1 μM RepSox, Figure 1D). Most surprisingly, BrdU was found to be able to replace Oct4, and induce iPSC generation with SKM. All three concentrations of BrdU were found to be effective (Figure 1E). More than 20 GFP+ colonies could be observed in the 5 μM BrdU-treated wells (starting from 50 000 MEFs/well in a 6-well plate), while none was found in the control wells (Figure 1E). Genomic PCR analysis confirmed that the SKM-iPSCs were free of Oct4 transgene contamination (Figure 1J).Previous studies have suggested that Oct4 is the most essential of the four Yamanaka factors. Several chemical cocktails were found to be effective in inducing reprogramming only in the presence of Oct46,7. To date, only one study demonstrated that a 7-chemical cocktail (VPA (V), CHIR99021 (C), E-616452 (6, Repsox), Parnate (Tranylcypromine, P), Forskolin (F), DZNep (Z) and TTNPB (T)), with C6FZ being the core components, was able to fully replace Yamanaka factors and induce reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts8. As BrdU was able to replace Oct4, we asked whether it could be useful in chemical-induced reprogramming. In the chemical-induced reprogramming system, VC6PFT were added from day 0 to day 32, and Z was added from day 16 to day 32. The chemical cocktail was supplemented with various concentrations of BrdU from day 0 to day 32. After day 32, medium containing chemicals was replaced with the 2i-medium. GFP+ colonies appeared at around day 45. BrdU (5 μM) enhanced 7 chemical-induced reprogramming by approximately threefold (Figure 1F). We failed to observe GFP+ iPSCs with only 4 chemicals (C6FZ) after a 2-month induction, but in BrdU-treated groups, ∼10 GFP+ colonies could be observed (Figure 1G). Further experiments indicated that Z could also be removed from the cocktail, a C6F-BrdU combination could successfully induce the generation of GFP+ iPSCs, although the efficiency was extremely low (Figure 1H).Typical chemically generated iPSC (CiPSC) colonies (Figure 1I) were selected for further analyses. CiPSCs induced by different chemical cocktails were referred to as 7B (VC6PFZT plus BrdU)-, 4B (C6FZ plus BrdU)- or 3B (C6F plus BrdU)-CiPSCs. Genomic PCR analysis confirmed that the 4B-CiPSC clones were free of transgene contamination (Figure 1J). Real-time PCR analysis revealed the reactivation of the endogenous Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Rex1 in the CiPSCs (Supplementary information, Figure S3A and S3B). Bisulfite genomic sequencing analyses showed that the Oct4 and Nanog promoters were demethylated in the 4B-CiPSCs similar to ESCs and different from MEFs (Figure 1K). Both the 4B- and 3B-CiPSC clones maintained GFP expression and ESC-like morphology, and expressed pluripotency markers such as alkaline phosphatase, Nanog, and SSEA1 (Figure 1L and Supplementary information, Figure S3C). Karyotyping analysis of 4B-CiPSC clone 6 (4B-CiPSC-6) revealed a normal mouse karyotype (40, XY) (Supplementary information, Figure S3D). The 4B-CiPSC-6 clone was then induced to form embryoid bodies (EBs) in vitro. qRT-PCR analysis revealed the upregulation of lineage-specific genes in CiPSC-derived EBs similar to E14-derived EBs (Supplementary information, Figure S3E), and immunofluorescence staining identified cells in all three germ layers (Supplementary information, Figure S3F). Both the 4B- and 3B-CiPSC clones were able to form teratomas in NOD-SCID mice and differentiate into three germ layers in vivo (Figure 1M and Supplementary information, Figure S3G). Furthermore, the 4B-CiPSC-6 clone was able to produce chimeric mice when injected into ICR blastocysts (Figure 1N).BrdU is a thymidine analog that is incorporated into DNA of dividing cells, and is thus used for birth dating and monitoring cell proliferation. Currently BrdU labeling is the most used technique for studying adult neurogenesis in mammals, including human11. It has also been used in cancer patients for diagnostic purposes12. The exact mechanisms by which BrdU promotes transcription factor- and chemical-induced reprogramming remain unclear. A previous report indicated that BrdU could increase the multipotency of human mesenchymal stem cells13. However, our data demonstrate that BrdU is detrimental for ESC self-renewal. Previous studies have demonstrated that BrdU incorporation could affect DNA structure11, and may thus induce epigenetic changes necessary for the reprogramming. However, such DNA modification may also lead to DNA instability, increasing the risk of sister chromatid exchanges, mutations and double-strand breaks11 and cause toxicity to the cells. We therefore tested BrdU with the thymidine kinase (TK) gene mutation assay, a classical assay used to evaluate cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of developing drugs14,15. In this assay, we used the human lymphoblastoid cell line TK6, which is heterozygous at the TK locus (TK+/−) and thus the wild-type allele serves as a target for mutation. As demonstrated in Supplementary information, Table S1, BrdU at 25 μM, a concentration higher than that was used for reprogramming, did not affect the mutation frequency, although slightly reduced the relative suspension growth. At higher concentrations (50-200 μM), BrdU indeed significantly increased the mutation frequency (Supplementary information, Table S1). These results indicate that BrdU at reprogramming-effective concentrations will not cause genotoxicity to cells, further confirming the karyotyping result (Supplementary information, Figure S3D).In summary, we demonstrate that BrdU can replace Oct4, the most critical factor in iPSC generation, and promotes full-chemical induction of mouse iPSCs with the minimal combination being BrdU, CHIR99021, Repsox and Forskolin. Since BrdU has already been used in patients12, this combination may lay a foundation for full-chemical induction of human iPSCs and may eventually provide a safer strategy to generate clinically applicable iPSCs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201596"
"cr","RHOBTB3 promotes proteasomal degradation of HIFα through facilitating hydroxylation and suppresses the Warburg effect","Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are master regulators of adaptive responses to low oxygen, and their α-subunits are rapidly degraded through the ubiquitination-dependent proteasomal pathway after hydroxylation. Aberrant accumulation or activation of HIFs is closely linked to many types of cancer. However, how hydroxylation of HIFα and its delivery to the ubiquitination machinery are regulated remains unclear. Here we show that Rho-related BTB domain-containing protein 3 (RHOBTB3) directly interacts with the hydroxylase PHD2 to promote HIFα hydroxylation. RHOBTB3 also directly interacts with the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, facilitating ubiquitination of HIFα. Remarkably, RHOBTB3 dimerizes with LIMD1, and constructs a RHOBTB3/LIMD1-PHD2-VHL-HIFα complex to effect the maximal degradation of HIFα. Hypoxia reduces the RHOBTB3-centered complex formation, resulting in an accumulation of HIFα. Importantly, the expression level of RHOBTB3 is greatly reduced in human renal carcinomas, and RHOBTB3 deficiency significantly elevates the Warburg effect and accelerates xenograft growth. Our work thus reveals that RHOBTB3 serves as a scaffold to organize a multi-subunit complex that promotes the hydroxylation, ubiquitination and degradation of HIFα.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201590"
"cr","High salt primes a specific activation state of macrophages, M(Na)","High salt is positively associated with the risk of many diseases. However, little is known about the mechanisms. Here we showed that high salt increased proinflammatory molecules, while decreased anti-inflammatory and proendocytic molecules in both human and mouse macrophages. High salt also potentiated lipopolysaccharide-induced macrophage activation and suppressed interleukin 4-induced macrophage activation. High salt induced the proinflammatory aspects by activating p38/cFos and/or Erk1/2/cFos pathways, while inhibited the anti-inflammatory and proendocytic aspects by Erk1/2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 pathway. Consistent with the in vitro results, high-salt diet increased proinflammatory gene expression of mouse alveolar macrophages. In mouse models of acute lung injury, high-salt diet aggravated lipopolysaccharide-induced pulmonary macrophage activation and inflammation in lungs. These results identify a novel macrophage activation state, M(Na), and high salt as a potential environmental risk factor for lung inflammation through the induction of M(Na).","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201587"
"cr","Dynamic tubulation of mitochondria drives mitochondrial network formation","Mitochondria form networks. Formation of mitochondrial networks is important for maintaining mitochondrial DNA integrity and interchanging mitochondrial material, whereas disruption of the mitochondrial network affects mitochondrial functions. According to the current view, mitochondrial networks are formed by fusion of individual mitochondria. Here, we report a new mechanism for formation of mitochondrial networks through KIF5B-mediated dynamic tubulation of mitochondria. We found that KIF5B pulls thin, highly dynamic tubules out of mitochondria. Fusion of these dynamic tubules, which is mediated by mitofusins, gives rise to the mitochondrial network. We further demonstrated that dynamic tubulation and fusion is sufficient for mitochondrial network formation, by reconstituting mitochondrial networks in vitro using purified fusion-competent mitochondria, recombinant KIF5B, and polymerized microtubules. Interestingly, KIF5B only controls network formation in the peripheral zone of the cell, indicating that the mitochondrial network is divided into subzones, which may be constructed by different mechanisms. Our data not only uncover an essential mechanism for mitochondrial network formation, but also reveal that different parts of the mitochondrial network are formed by different mechanisms.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201589"
"cr","An HNF1α-regulated feedback circuit modulates hepatic fibrogenesis via the crosstalk between hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells","Hepatocytes are critical for the maintenance of liver homeostasis, but its involvement in hepatic fibrogenesis remains elusive. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1α (HNF1α) is a liver-enriched transcription factor that plays a key role in hepatocyte function. Our previous study revealed a significant inhibitory effect of HNF1α on hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, we report that the expression of HNF1α is significantly repressed in both human and rat fibrotic liver. Knockdown of HNF1α in the liver significantly aggravates hepatic fibrogenesis in either dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) or bile duct ligation (BDL) model in rats. In contrast, forced expression of HNF1α markedly alleviates hepatic fibrosis. HNF1α regulates the transcriptional expression of SH2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 (SHP-1) via directly binding to SHP-1 promoter in hepatocytes. Inhibition of SHP-1 expression abrogates the anti-fibrotic effect of HNF1α in DMN-treated rats. Moreover, HNF1α repression in primary hepatocytes leads to the activation of NF-κB and JAK/STAT pathways and initiates an inflammatory feedback circuit consisting of HNF1α, SHP-1, STAT3, p65, miR-21 and miR-146a, which sustains the deregulation of HNF1α in hepatocytes. More interestingly, a coordinated crosstalk between hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) participates in this positive feedback circuit and facilitates the progression of hepatocellular damage. Our findings demonstrate that impaired hepatocytes play an active role in hepatic fibrogenesis. Early intervention of HNF1α-regulated inflammatory feedback loop in hepatocytes may have beneficial effects in the treatment of chronic liver diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201584"
"cr","Mutation of kri1l causes definitive hematopoiesis failure via PERK-dependent excessive autophagy induction","Dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis causes human diseases, such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia, del (5q-) syndrome and bone marrow failure. However, the mechanisms of blood disorders in these diseases remain elusive. Through genetic mapping, molecular cloning and mechanism characterization of the zebrafish mutant cas002, we reveal a novel connection between ribosomal dysfunction and excessive autophagy in the regulation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). cas002 carries a recessive lethal mutation in kri1l gene that encodes an essential component of rRNA small subunit processome. We show that Kri1l is required for normal ribosome biogenesis, expansion of definitive HSPCs and subsequent lineage differentiation. Through live imaging and biochemical studies, we find that loss of Kri1l causes the accumulation of misfolded proteins and excessive PERK activation-dependent autophagy in HSPCs. Blocking autophagy but not inhibiting apoptosis by Bcl2 overexpression can fully rescue hematopoietic defects, but not the lethality of kri1lcas002 embryos. Treatment with autophagy inhibitors (3-MA and Baf A1) or PERK inhibitor (GSK2656157), or knockdown of beclin1 or perk can markedly restore HSPC proliferation and definitive hematopoietic cell differentiation. These results may provide leads for effective therapeutics that benefit patients with anemia or bone marrow failure caused by ribosome disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201581"
"cr","Integrative genome-wide analysis reveals HLP1, a novel RNA-binding protein, regulates plant flowering by targeting alternative polyadenylation","Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is a widespread mechanism for gene regulation and has been implicated in flowering, but the molecular basis governing the choice of a specific poly(A) site during the vegetative-to-reproductive growth transition remains unclear. Here we characterize HLP1, an hnRNP A/B protein as a novel regulator for pre-mRNA 3′-end processing in Arabidopsis. Genetic analysis reveals that HLP1 suppresses Flowering Locus C (FLC), a key repressor of flowering in Arabidopsis. Genome-wide mapping of HLP1-RNA interactions indicates that HLP1 binds preferentially to A-rich and U-rich elements around cleavage and polyadenylation sites, implicating its role in 3′-end formation. We show HLP1 is significantly enriched at transcripts involved in RNA metabolism and flowering. Comprehensive profiling of the poly(A) site usage reveals that HLP1 mutations cause thousands of poly(A) site shifts. A distal-to-proximal poly(A) site shift in the flowering regulator FCA, a direct target of HLP1, leads to upregulation of FLC and delayed flowering. Our results elucidate that HLP1 is a novel factor involved in 3′-end processing and controls reproductive timing via targeting APA.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201577"
"cr","DNA methylation requires a DNMT1 ubiquitin interacting motif (UIM) and histone ubiquitination","DNMT1 is recruited by PCNA and UHRF1 to maintain DNA methylation after replication. UHRF1 recognizes hemimethylated DNA substrates via the SRA domain, but also repressive H3K9me3 histone marks with its TTD. With systematic mutagenesis and functional assays, we could show that chromatin binding further involved UHRF1 PHD binding to unmodified H3R2. These complementation assays clearly demonstrated that the ubiquitin ligase activity of the UHRF1 RING domain is required for maintenance DNA methylation. Mass spectrometry of UHRF1-deficient cells revealed H3K18 as a novel ubiquitination target of UHRF1 in mammalian cells. With bioinformatics and mutational analyses, we identified a ubiquitin interacting motif (UIM) in the N-terminal regulatory domain of DNMT1 that binds to ubiquitinated H3 tails and is essential for DNA methylation in vivo. H3 ubiquitination and subsequent DNA methylation required UHRF1 PHD binding to H3R2. These results show the manifold regulatory mechanisms controlling DNMT1 activity that require the reading and writing of epigenetic marks by UHRF1 and illustrate the multifaceted interplay between DNA and histone modifications. The identification and functional characterization of the DNMT1 UIM suggests a novel regulatory principle and we speculate that histone H2AK119 ubiquitination might also lead to UIM-dependent recruitment of DNMT1 and DNA methylation beyond classic maintenance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201572"
"cr","Angiomotin binding-induced activation of Merlin/NF2 in the Hippo pathway","The tumor suppressor Merlin/NF2 functions upstream of the core Hippo pathway kinases Lats1/2 and Mst1/2, as well as the nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4DCAF1. Numerous mutations of Merlin have been identified in Neurofibromatosis type 2 and other cancer patients. Despite more than two decades of research, the upstream regulator of Merlin in the Hippo pathway remains unknown. Here we show by high-resolution crystal structures that the Lats1/2-binding site on the Merlin FERM domain is physically blocked by Merlin's auto-inhibitory tail. Angiomotin binding releases the auto-inhibition and promotes Merlin's binding to Lats1/2. Phosphorylation of Ser518 outside the Merlin's auto-inhibitory tail does not obviously alter Merlin's conformation, but instead prevents angiomotin from binding and thus inhibits Hippo pathway kinase activation. Cancer-causing mutations clustered in the angiomotin-binding domain impair angiomotin-mediated Merlin activation. Our findings reveal that angiomotin and Merlin respectively interface cortical actin filaments and core kinases in Hippo signaling, and allow construction of a complete Hippo signaling pathway.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201569"
"cr","Metabolic reprogramming in macrophages and dendritic cells in innate immunity","Activation of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) by pro-inflammatory stimuli causes them to undergo a metabolic switch towards glycolysis and away from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), similar to the Warburg effect in tumors. However, it is only recently that the mechanisms responsible for this metabolic reprogramming have been elucidated in more detail. The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) plays an important role under conditions of both hypoxia and normoxia. The withdrawal of citrate from the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle has been shown to be critical for lipid biosynthesis in both macrophages and DCs. Interference with this process actually abolishes the ability of DCs to activate T cells. Another TCA cycle intermediate, succinate, activates HIF-1α and promotes inflammatory gene expression. These new insights are providing us with a deeper understanding of the role of metabolic reprogramming in innate immunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201568"
"cr","P2RX7 sensitizes Mac-1/ICAM-1-dependent leukocyte-endothelial adhesion and promotes neurovascular injury during septic encephalopathy","Septic encephalopathy (SE) is a critical factor determining sepsis mortality. Vascular inflammation is known to be involved in SE, but the molecular events that lead to the development of encephalopathy remain unclear. Using time-lapse in vivo two-photon laser scanning microscopy, we provide the first direct evidence that cecal ligation and puncture in septic mice induces microglial trafficking to sites adjacent to leukocyte adhesion on inflamed cerebral microvessels. Our data further demonstrate that septic injury increased the chemokine CXCL1 level in brain endothelial cells by activating endothelial P2RX7 and eventually enhanced the binding of Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18)-expressing leukocytes to endothelial ICAM-1. In turn, leukocyte adhesion upregulated endothelial CX3CL1, thereby triggering microglia trafficking to the injured site. The sepsis-induced increase in endothelial CX3CL1 was abolished in CD18 hypomorphic mutant mice. Inhibition of the P2RX7 pathway not only decreased endothelial ICAM-1 expression and leukocyte adhesion but also prevented microglia overactivation, reduced brain injury, and consequently doubled the early survival of septic mice. These results demonstrate the role of the P2RX7 pathway in linking neurovascular inflammation to brain damage in vivo and provide a rationale for targeting endothelial P2RX7 for neurovascular protection during SE.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201561"
"cr","Combination of inflammation-related cytokines promotes long-term muscle stem cell expansion","Muscle stem cells (MuSCs, satellite cells) are the major contributor to muscle regeneration. Like most adult stem cells, long-term expansion of MuSCs in vitro is difficult. The in vivo muscle regeneration abilities of MuSCs are quickly lost after culturing in vitro, which prevents the potential applications of MuSCs in cell-based therapies. Here, we establish a system to serially expand MuSCs in vitro for over 20 passages by mimicking the endogenous microenvironment. We identified that the combination of four pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1α, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ, secreted by T cells was able to stimulate MuSC proliferation in vivo upon injury and promote serial expansion of MuSCs in vitro. The expanded MuSCs can replenish the endogenous stem cell pool and are capable of repairing multiple rounds of muscle injuries in vivo after a single transplantation. The establishment of the in vitro system provides us a powerful method to expand functional MuSCs to repair muscle injuries.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201558"
"cr","In-cell infection: a novel pathway for Epstein-Barr virus infection mediated by cell-in-cell structures","Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can infect both susceptible B lymphocytes and non-susceptible epithelial cells (ECs). Viral tropism analyses have revealed two intriguing means of EBV infection, either by a receptor-mediated infection of B cells or by a cell-to-cell contact-mediated infection of non-susceptible ECs. Herein, we report a novel “in-cell infection” mechanism for EBV infection of non-susceptible ECs through the formation of cell-in-cell structures. Epithelial CNE-2 cells were invaded by EBV-infected Akata B cells to form cell-in-cell structures in vitro. Such unique cellular structures could be readily observed in the specimens of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Importantly, the formation of cell-in-cell structures led to the autonomous activation of EBV within Akata cells and subsequent viral transmission to CNE-2 cells, as evidenced by the expression of viral genes and the presence of virion particles in CNE-2 cells. Significantly, EBV generated from in-cell infected ECs displayed altered tropism with higher infection efficacy to both B cells and ECs. In addition to CNE-2 tumor cells, cell-in-cell structure formation could also mediate EBV infection of NPEC1-Bmi1 cells, an immortalized nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line. Furthermore, efficient infection by this mechanism involved the activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Thus, our study identified “in-cell infection” as a novel mechanism for EBV infection. Given the diversity of virus-infected cells and the prevalence of cell-in-cell structures during chronic infection, we speculate that “in-cell infection” is likely a general mechanism for EBV and other viruses to infect non-susceptible ECs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201550"
"cr","Epigenetic silencing of microRNA-149 in cancer-associated fibroblasts mediates prostaglandin E2/interleukin-6 signaling in the tumor microenvironment","Tumor initiation and growth depend on its microenvironment in which cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in tumor stroma play an important role. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin (IL)-6 signal pathways are involved in the crosstalk between tumor and stromal cells. However, how PGE2-mediated signaling modulates this crosstalk remains unclear. Here, we show that microRNA (miR)-149 links PGE2 and IL-6 signaling in mediating the crosstalk between tumor cells and CAFs in gastric cancer (GC). miR-149 inhibited fibroblast activation by targeting IL-6 and miR-149 expression was substantially suppressed in the CAFs of GC. miR-149 negatively regulated CAFs and their effect on GC development both in vitro and in vivo. CAFs enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the stem-like properties of GC cells in a miR-149-IL-6-dependent manner. In addition to IL-6, PGE2 receptor 2 (PTGER2/EP2) was revealed as another potential target of miR-149 in fibroblasts. Furthermore, H. pylori infection, a leading cause of human GC, was able to induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/PGE2 signaling and to enhance PGE2 production, resulting in the hypermethylation of miR-149 in CAFs and increased IL-6 secretion. Our findings indicate that miR-149 mediates the crosstalk between tumor cells and CAFs in GC and highlight the potential of interfering miRNAs in stromal cells to improve cancer therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201551"
"cr","Paternally contributed centrioles exhibit exceptional persistence in C. elegans embryos","The two gametes make different contributions to the zygote at fertilization. Although both gametes contribute genetic material, in most animal species the oocyte donates the bulk of cytoplasmic constituents and cellular organelles, including mitochondria, whereas the sperm donates two centrioles. Centrioles are microtubule-based organelles that serve as templates for the axoneme of cilia and flagella across eukaryotic evolution, and as platforms for centrosome assembly in most animal cells1. How long the two centrioles contributed by the sperm persist in the developing embryo is not known in any system. More generally, although centrioles are reputed to be stable structures, the extent to which their constituents persist over several cell cycles has been scarcely studied. Two instances of centriolar components being stable for one (α/β tubulin in mammalian cells) or two (SAS-4 in C. elegans) cell cycles have been reported2,3,4, but whether these and other centriolar components remain stable for more cell cycles is not known.We used C. elegans as a model system to assess the persistence of centriolar components in the context of a developing organism. We utilized a marked mating experimental strategy to specifically mark paternally contributed centriolar components and assess their persistence throughout embryonic development (Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Data S1). In brief, feminized fog-2 (q71) mutant worms lacking sperm were mated with males expressing a given centriolar protein fused to GFP, and the resulting embryos were analyzed using immunofluorescence with antibodies against GFP and the pan-centriolar marker IFA. Five evolutionarily conserved proteins (SPD-2, ZYG-1, SAS-4, SAS-5 and SAS-6) are specifically required for centriole formation in C. elegans1, a process that also requires the centriolar constituents α/β-tubulin5,6. For our analysis, we selected SAS-4, which has been reported to persist for two cell cycles in C. elegans3,4, as well as the β-tubulin protein TBB-2, since centriolar α/β tubulin has been shown to persist for one cell cycle in mammalian cells2. Moreover, we analyzed the behavior of SAS-6, the founding member of a protein family critical for the onset of centriole assembly across eukaryotic evolution7,8.Figure 1Paternally contributed centriolar components persist throughout C. elegans embryogenesis. (A) Marked mating experimental strategy to track paternally contributed centriolar components during C. elegans embryogenesis. Feminized fog-2 animals were crossed with males expressing given GFP-tagged centriolar components in the germline; the zygotes generated thereby inherited paternally contributed GFP-positive centrioles. Thereafter, centrioles formed in the embryo were assembled using the maternally contributed cytoplasmic pool of proteins, which is GFP negative. (B, C, E, F) C. elegans embryos at the indicated stages stemming from marked mating experiments with GFP::SAS-4 males. Embryos were stained with antibodies against GFP (green) and the pan-centriolar marker IFA (red), as well as with Hoechst to reveal DNA (blue). Scale bar, 5 μm. Insets are 5-time magnified views of centrioles. Note that as a result of unspecific immunostaining, small background green foci not colocalizing with IFA can be observed in some images; such foci were not taken into consideration for analysis. (D) Quantification of the GFP signal of paternally contributed centrioles at the indicated stages of early development for GFP::SAS-4 by immunofluorescence analysis. Signal intensity is expressed relative to the average signal of the 1-cell stage embryos. The approximately two-fold intensity observed in sperm compared to 1-cell stage embryos reflects the fact that sperm cells carry two GFP-tagged centrioles. Number of centrioles analyzed: sperm, n = 417; 1 cell, n = 20; 2 cells, n = 14; 4 cells, n = 16; 8 cells, n = 16; 10-23 cells, n = 20. (G) Percentage of embryos with 1, 2 or no GFP-positive paternally contributed centrioles from marked mating experiments with GFP::SAS-4 at the indicated stages of embryogenesis.Full size imageThese marked mating experiments revealed that centriolar GFP::SAS-4 persisted without significant decrease in signal intensity during the first four embryonic cell cycles (Figure 1B-1D). We likewise assessed the persistence of paternally contributed GFP::TBB-2 and SAS-6::GFP. As shown in Supplementary information, Figure S1A-S1F, these components also persisted in the early embryos without detectable decrease in signal intensity during the first four cell cycles. The SAS-6 data are especially surprising in the light of findings in human cells, where the cartwheel protein HsSAS-6 is degraded during mitosis at each cell cycle9. We also noted that the signal intensity of GFP::TBB-2 often differs between the two paternally contributed centrioles (Supplementary information, Figure S1A-S1B), perhaps reflecting a difference in the number of GFP-tagged proteins incorporated into centrioles during spermatogenesis.We next investigated for how long paternally contributed centriolar components can be detected during embryonic development. To this end, we used both GFP::SAS-4 and SAS-6::GFP, as their stronger signal compared to that of GFP::TBB-2 enabled more robust detection. Remarkably, we found that the two paternal centrioles marked by GFP::SAS-4 could be identified in all embryos up to the ∼350-cell stage (Figure 1E and 1G). Furthermore, one paternal centriole carrying GFP::SAS-4 could frequently be detected even at the ∼550-cell stage (Figure 1F and 1G). Comparable results were found with SAS-6::GFP (Supplementary information, Figure S1G-1I), although the centriolar GFP signal became undetectable earlier in this case, possibly due to the overall dimmer intensity of this fusion protein compared to GFP::SAS-4. The fact that both GFP::SAS-4 and SAS-6::GFP were no longer detected in the majority of cases towards the end of embryogenesis could reflect technical limitations in detecting centriolar proteins by immunofluorescence at late stages. In support of this notion, we observed that the IFA pan-centriolar staining is less reliable towards the end of embryogenesis (Supplementary information, Figure S1J-S1M).In summary, our data demonstrate that paternally contributed centriolar components exhibit remarkable persistence in the embryo. Given that β-tubulin, SAS-4 and SAS-6 are core structural components of centrioles, the entire centriole organelle could be considered to exhibit exceptional persistence across many cell cycles. It will be of interest to determine whether such exceptional persistence can be extended to centrioles of somatic cells in nematodes and also to other systems. Macromolecular complexes other than centrioles exhibit long-term persistence. This is the case for example of nucleopores in terminally differentiated cells, where cumulative damages in some nucleopore constituents have been linked to cell aging, both in C. elegans and rats10. Similarly, cumulative damages of centriolar components exhibiting long-term persistence could eventually be detrimental to function and even contribute to disease. Our findings also raise the intriguing possibility that centrioles may act as information carriers across several cell cycles, for instance through posttranslational modifications of the persistent centriolar proteins reported here. Conceivably, this could also allow the paternal gamete to donate dedicated information to the zygote, in a manner that is conceptually analogous and reciprocal to the contribution of maternally provided mitochondria.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201549"

In plants, a well-recognized form of PCD is hypersensitive response (HR) triggered by pathogens, which involves the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other signaling molecules. While the mitochondrion is a master regulator of PCD in animals, the chloroplast is known to regulate PCD in plants. Arabidopsis Mosaic Death 1 (MOD1), an enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase essential for fatty acid biosynthesis in chloroplasts, negatively regulates PCD in Arabidopsis. Here we report that PCD in mod1 results from accumulated ROS and can be suppressed by mutations in mitochondrial complex I components, and that the suppression is confirmed by pharmaceutical inhibition of the complex I-generated ROS. We further show that intact mitochondria are required for full HR and optimum disease resistance to the Pseudomonas syringae bacteria. These findings strongly indicate that the ROS generated in the electron transport chain in mitochondria plays a key role in triggering plant PCD and highlight an important role of the communication between chloroplast and mitochondrion in the control of PCD in plants.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201546"
"cr","Intron targeting-mediated and endogenous gene integrity-maintaining knockin in zebrafish using the CRISPR/Cas9 system","Animals carrying exogenous genes integrated at specific genomic loci are versatile tools for biological research1. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), an emerging vertebrate animal model, is widely used in studies on genetics, developmental biology and neurobiology. Although loss-of-function genomic editing for zebrafish has been well developed2,3,4, lack of feasible methods for inserting a large exogenous DNA sequence into the zebrafish genome is becoming a bottleneck for zebrafish-relevant research. It was reported that the coding sequence of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) can be integrated at the zebrafish tyrosine hydroxylase (th) locus through TALEN-mediated double-stranded breaks and homologous recombination (HR) with a low efficiency6. However, the targeted gene was destroyed and EGFP failed to express6. Recently, by using the type II bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 system (CRISPR/Cas9), two non-HR-based knockin approaches were developed to insert Gal4 (a transcriptional transactivator) and EGFP into zebrafish genomic loci with a relatively high efficiency7,8. However, the coding sequence of targeted endogenous genes was disrupted or the expression pattern of inserted exogenous genes could not well recapitulate the endogenous ones as insertion occurred within either the exon7 or cis-regulatory elements of targeted genes8. These disadvantages will limit their application in neuroscience research. Here, using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, we developed an intron targeting-mediated and HR-independent efficient knockin approach for zebrafish, with which the intactness of the coding sequence and regulatory elements of targeted endogenous genes are maintained.The Th protein is a rate-limiting enzyme for synthesizing two important neuromodulators, dopamine and noradrenline. As dopamine and noradrenline are synthesized and released by dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons, respectively, Th is a specific marker for these cells. We designed a short guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the last intron of the zebrafish th and performed co-injection of sgRNA and mRNA of zebrafish codon-optimized Cas9 (zCas9) into one-cell-stage zebrafish embryo, which yielded a cleavage efficiency of ∼83% (Supplementary information, Table S1A and S1B). Next, we designed a donor plasmid th-P2A-EGFP consisting of three parts: a left arm, a P2A-EGFP coding sequence, and a right arm (Figure 1A). To retain the full coding sequence of th, the left arm begins from the upstream of the 5′ side of the sgRNA target site in the last intron, spans the whole last exon E13, and ends at the last base just before the stop codon of th. To keep the normal control of Th expression, the right arm includes the stop codon and 3′ regulatory elements of th. The P2A peptide is a linker for multicistronic expression9.Figure 1Intron targeting-mediated EGFP knockin at the zebrafish th locus. (A) Schematic of the intron targeting-mediated strategy for generating EGFP knockin at the zebrafish th locus by using the CRISPR/Cas9 system. The sgRNA target sequence is shown in red and the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence in green. The left and right arm sequences of the donor plasmid are indicated by the brown lines with double arrows. The left arm is 1 298 bp, and the right arm is 671 bp. The th-P2A-EGFP cassette was integrated into the th locus after co-injection of the donor with the sgRNA and zCas9 mRNA. The zebrafish th has 13 exons, and E12 and E13 represent the 12th and 13th exons, respectively. Right: the schematic of the mRNA and protein of the targeted th gene.

Scale bar, 10 μm. (I) Whole-cell currents of an EGFP-expressing LC neuron. Under voltage-clamp mode, the neuron was held at −60 mV and voltage pulses from −100 to 30 mV with an interval of 10 mV were applied. Action potential currents (arrow) appear near −30 mV.Full size imageWe co-injected the donor plasmid, sgRNA and the zCas9 mRNA into one-cell-stage fertilized zebrafish egg. As both the donor plasmid DNA and the last intron of th contain sgRNA target site, concurrent cleavage by sgRNA/Cas9 would result in efficient and specific integration of the donor DNA into the th locus via non-HR. Indeed, we observed EGFP expression in the brain of injected larvae 3 days post fertilization (dpf) (33/139; Supplementary information, Figure S1A1 and Table S1B). Based on their location and morphology10, EGFP-expressing cells included dopaminergic neurons in the posterior tubercular (PT), intermediate hypothalamus (HI) and pretectum (Pre), and noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) and medulla oblongata (MO) (Supplementary information, Figure S1A1). Successful non-HR-mediated insertion of the th-P2A-EGFP donor was then verified by PCR using target site- and donor-specific primers and junction sequencing analysis (Supplementary information, Figures S1A2 and S1A3). The specificity of knockin events was further confirmed by in situ immunohistochemistry staining, which revealed that EGFP was co-localized with Th in 46 out of 48 Th-positive cells in three larvae examined (Supplementary information, Figures S1A4 and S1A5).To examine the germline transmission of knockin events, 25 embryos showing mosaic expression of EGFP were raised to adulthood. Each of them was then outcrossed to wild-type (WT) zebrafish, and their F1 progenies were screened for EGFP signal. Three F0 founders were identified, and EGFP-positive F1 progenies were produced at rates ranging from 15.5% to 21.1% (Supplementary information, Table S1C). As expected, in comparison with F0 (Supplementary information, Figure S1A1), more EGFP-expressing dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons were observed in F1 progenies (Figure 1B), including neurons in the olfactory bulb (OB), Pre, PT, HI, LC and MO. PCR and junction sequencing analysis of F1 progenies confirmed the inheritance of the genomic integration of their corresponding F0 founders (Figure 1C and 1D). Immunostaining was also performed in the F1 embryos of th-P2A-EGFP knockin fish, and EGFP signal was found to be well co-localized with the Th protein (98% ± 1%, mean ± SEM, in 5 larvae; Figure 1E), suggesting the high specificity of EGFP expression in the stable knockin lines.As the full reading frame and regulatory elements of th were maintained by using this knockin strategy, both the integrity and expression pattern of the gene product should be normal. To examine these points, we extracted the total protein from F1 embryos carrying EGFP knockin at th and performed western blot analysis. F1 embryos were heterozygous because they were generated by crossing knockin F0 founders with WT fish. By using a Th antibody, two bands for knockin embryos were detected (Figure 1F). The lower band at around 56 kDa represents the WT Th protein derived from a WT th allele. The P2A peptide is about 2 kDa and cleaved between the last two amino acids. If knockin events did not affect the integrity of the Th protein, the cleavage of the Th-P2A-EGFP protein will result in two products: Th-P2A fusion protein (58 kDa) and EGFP protein (Figure 1A). Therefore, the upper band at around 58 kDa indicates the integrity of the Th protein produced from a knockin th allele. Furthermore, the expression levels of the WT Th protein and the knockin Th-P2A fusion protein were almost equal (Figure 1F), further suggesting that our knockin strategy does not impair the expression level of the targeted endogenous gene. To examine whether knockin events affect Th functions, we then performed immunostaining of dopamine, the level of which can reflect the activity of Th. The intensities of dopamine signals in dopaminergic neurons were not significantly different between knockin F1 and WT embryos (P = 0.4; Figure 1G), suggesting that Th function is not affected by knockin events.To examine the physiological normality of neurons carrying targeted integration, in vivo whole-cell recording was subsequently performed in homozygous th-P2A-EGFP knockin F2 larvae (Figure 1H). EGFP-expressing neurons exhibited a normal intrinsic membrane property, as reflected by outwardly rectifying whole-cell currents (Figure 1I).To extend the application of our knockin strategy to other exogenous genes, we generated knockin fish carrying the transactivator protein Gal4 at the th locus by using the same strategy, in which only the EGFP coding sequence was replaced with the Gal4 sequence (th-P2A-Gal4; Supplementary information, Figure S1B1). After injection of Gal4 knockin-relevant elements into fertilized eggs of Tg(UAS:GCaMP5) transgenic zebrafish, integration events were visualized by the expression of GCaMP5 in dopaminergic or noradrenergic neurons (Supplementary information, Figure S1B2). As GCaMP5 is a genetically encoded calcium indicator, we could observe mechanical stimulus-induced calcium responses in neurons by puffing water to the fish tail through a micropipette. We also injected the Gal4 knockin-relevant elements into WT fish to screen for th-P2A-Gal4 knockin founders. As the Gal4 protein has no fluorescence, we raised the injected knockin embryos to adulthood without prior selection and crossed these adults with Tg(UAS:Kaede) transgenic fish. Two founders were identified among the total of 28 injected fish (Supplementary information, Table S1D), as evidenced by the fact that dopaminergic neurons were labeled by Kaede in their progenies, which were produced at a mean rate of ∼7% (Supplementary information, Figure S1B4 and Table S1D). Successful insertion of the th-P2A-Gal4 donor was then verified by PCR and junction sequencing analysis in F1 progenies (Supplementary information, Figures S1B5 and S1B6).It was reported that the CRISPR/Cas9 system shows a high frequency of off-target (OT) cleavage in human cell lines, and the specificity of Cas9 targeting can tolerate up to three base pair (bp) mismatches between a sgRNA and its target DNA11. We therefore searched all zebrafish genomic loci containing up to 3-bp mismatches in comparison with the coding sequence of the th sgRNA, and found three potential OT sites. PCR and sequencing analysis of those potential OT sites in the genome of injected WT embryos or th-P2A-EGFP knockin F1 embryos did not reveal indels (Supplementary information, Table S1E), suggesting a low OT rate associated with our knockin strategy.The applicability of our knockin strategy was further validated by targeting other endogenous genes specifically expressed in different types of cells, as exemplified by the integration of EGFP into the zebrafish tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (tph2), glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap), and flk1 loci. These EGFP insertions resulted in the specific labeling of serotoninergic neurons, glia and vascular endothelial cells, respectively (Supplementary information, Figures S1C-S1E, and Table S1A and S1B). It is worth noticing that, in the case of the tph2 knockin, the second last intron was selected for targeting, indicating that the last intron is the first but not the only choice for targeting. Furthermore, by replacing the P2A in the gfap-P2A-EGFP plasmid with a flexible serine-serine linker sequence, we succeeded in fusing an EGFP tag to endogenous Gfap (Supplementary information, Figure S1F), demonstrating that our knockin strategy can also be used to tag endogenous proteins.Taking advantage of both the HR for donor design and the non-HR for donor integration, we developed a novel CRISPR/Cas9-mediated intron-targeting knockin strategy, by which knockin zebrafish can be efficiently generated without disruption of targeted endogenous genes. Compared with HR, error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ)-involved non-HR knockin for zebrafish has two advantages. First, NHEJ is at least 10-fold more active than HR during early zebrafish development12. Second, unlike HR, NHEJ does not need the precise homology between the parent zebrafish and the targeting donor, avoiding time-consuming screening and genotyping of parent animals. More importantly, to maintain the integrity of targeted endogenous genes, we designed sgRNAs targeting introns, so that NHEJ-mediated indel mutations do not change the reading frame of targeted genes. In addition, intron targeting also theoretically increases the rate of in-frame insertion up to 3-fold in comparison with exon-based targeting. Furthermore, we artificially added the endogenous genome sequence spanning from the sgRNA target site to the 3′ intergenic region into donor plasmids. Therefore, the predicted forward ligation of the donor into the targeted locus retains the original reading frame and both 5′ and 3′ regulatory elements of targeted genes. Taken together, this strategy has two advantages: (1) inserted exogenous genes can faithfully recapitulate the expression pattern of targeted endogenous genes; (2) the expression and function of targeted endogenous genes are maintained. Thus, the readiness, high efficiency and targeted gene integrity maintenance make our strategy an applicable knockin approach for zebrafish and even other organisms.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201543"
"cr","Identification and characterization of phosphodiesterases that specifically degrade 3′3′-cyclic GMP-AMP","Cyclic dinucleotides act as intracellular second messengers, modulating a variety of cellular activities including innate immune activation. Although phosphodiesterases (PDEs) hydrolyzing c-di-GMP and c-di-AMP have been identified, no PDEs for cGAMPs have been reported. Here we identified the first three cGAMP-specific PDEs in V. cholerae (herein designated as V-cGAP1/2/3). V-cGAPs are HD-GYP domain-containing proteins and specifically break 3′3′-cGAMP, but not other forms of cGAMP. 3′3′-cGAMP is first linearized by all three V-cGAPs to produce 5′-pApG, which is further hydrolyzed into 5′-ApG by V-cGAP1. In this two-step reaction, V-cGAP1 functions as both a PDE and a 5′-nucleotidase. In vivo experiments demonstrated that V-cGAPs play non-redundant roles in cGAMP degradation. The high specificity of V-cGAPs on 3′3′-cGAMP suggests the existence of specific PDEs for other cGAMPs, including 2′3′-cGAMP in mammalian cells. The absolute requirement of the GYP motif for 3′3′-cGAMP degradation suggests that HD domain-containing PDEs in eukaryotes are probably unable to hydrolyze cGAMPs. The fact that all V-cGAPs attack 3′3′-cGAMP on one specific phosphodiester bond suggests that PDEs for other cGAMPs would utilize a similar strategy. These results will provide valuable information for identification and characterization of mammalian 2′3′-cGAMP-specific PDEs in future studies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201540"
"cr","Structure of the WD40 domain of SCAP from fission yeast reveals the molecular basis for SREBP recognition","The sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) are central players in the SREBP pathway, which control the cellular lipid homeostasis. SCAP binds to SREBP through their carboxyl (C) domains and escorts SREBP from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi upon sterol depletion. A conserved pathway, with the homologues of SREBP and SCAP being Sre1 and Scp1, was identified in fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Here we report the in vitro reconstitution of the complex between the C domains of Sre1 and Scp1 as well as the crystal structure of the WD40 domain of Scp1 at 2.1 Å resolution. The structure reveals an eight-bladed β-propeller that exhibits several distinctive features from a canonical WD40 repeat domain. Structural and biochemical characterization led to the identification of two Scp1 elements that are involved in Sre1 recognition, an Arg/Lys-enriched surface patch on the top face of the WD40 propeller and a 30-residue C-terminal tail. The structural and biochemical findings were corroborated by in vivo examinations. These studies serve as a framework for the mechanistic understanding and further functional characterization of the SREBP and SCAP proteins in fission yeast and higher organisms.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201532"
"cr","ERK kinase phosphorylates and destabilizes the tumor suppressor FBW7 in pancreatic cancer","F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBW7) is the substrate recognition component of the Skp1-Cul1-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex and functions as a major tumor suppressor by targeting various oncoproteins for degradation. Genomic deletion or mutation of FBW7 has frequently been identified in many human cancers but not in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Thus it is important to know how the tumor suppressive function of FBW7 is impaired in pancreatic cancer. In this study, we first observed that low FBW7 expression correlated significantly with ERK activation in pancreatic cancer clinical samples, primarily due to KRAS mutations in pancreatic cancer. We further showed that ERK directly interacted with FBW7 and phosphorylated FBW7 at Thr205, which sequentially promoted FBW7 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, the phospho-deficient T205A FBW7 mutant is resistant to ERK activation and could significantly suppress pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. These results collectively demonstrate how the oncogenic KRAS mutation inhibits the tumor suppressor FBW7, thus revealing an important function of KRAS mutations in promoting pancreatic cancer progression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201530"
"cr","Heparanase activates the syndecan-syntenin-ALIX exosome pathway","Exosomes are secreted vesicles of endosomal origin involved in signaling processes. We recently showed that the syndecan heparan sulfate proteoglycans control the biogenesis of exosomes through their interaction with syntenin-1 and the endosomal-sorting complex required for transport accessory component ALIX. Here we investigated the role of heparanase, the only mammalian enzyme able to cleave heparan sulfate internally, in the syndecan-syntenin-ALIX exosome biogenesis pathway. We show that heparanase stimulates the exosomal secretion of syntenin-1, syndecan and certain other exosomal cargo, such as CD63, in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, exosomal CD9, CD81 and flotillin-1 are not affected. Conversely, reduction of endogenous heparanase reduces the secretion of syntenin-1-containing exosomes. The ability of heparanase to stimulate exosome production depends on syntenin-1 and ALIX. Syndecans, but not glypicans, support exosome biogenesis in heparanase-exposed cells. Finally, heparanase stimulates intraluminal budding of syndecan and syntenin-1 in endosomes, depending on the syntenin-ALIX interaction. Taken together, our findings identify heparanase as a modulator of the syndecan-syntenin-ALIX pathway, fostering endosomal membrane budding and the biogenesis of exosomes by trimming the heparan sulfate chains on syndecans. In addition, our data suggest that this mechanism controls the selection of specific cargo to exosomes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201529"
"cr","A novel chemopreventive strategy based on therapeutic microRNAs produced in plants","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play a critical role in regulation of gene expression in nearly all eukaryotic organisms, including mammals. In humans, an estimated 60% of all protein-coding genes are targeted by miRNAs, affecting virtually every physiological process in the body1. In addition, a diverse array of human diseases is associated with dysregulation of miRNAs2. In many forms of cancer, for example, certain miRNAs, termed tumor suppressor miRNAs, are downregulated in diseased cells. Restoration of the downregulated tumor suppressor miRNA has been shown to block one or more steps in oncogenesis in animal models and cell culture systems. Thus, the therapeutic potential of tumor suppressor miRNAs has been experimentally confirmed and is now widely recognized. However, systemic delivery of such therapeutic small RNAs in humans is challenging and numerous delivery options are currently under investigation.We have investigated the possibility of an effective oral delivery system for therapeutic miRNAs. It has long been known that ingested RNA from food sources is taken up by the digestive system in nematodes and insects and can control the expression of genes in those organisms3. More recent evidence suggests that a similar phenomenon might occur in humans and other mammals4. These data indicate that plant miRNAs from foods are absorbed by cells of the mammalian digestive tract and packaged into microvesicles, which protect them from degradation. The miRNAs are then trafficked via the bloodstream to a variety of tissues, where they are capable of regulating the expression of mammalian genes. Such work has generated considerable excitement because it raises the possibility of bioengineering edible plants to produce therapeutic miRNAs that could then be delivered to affected tissues by ingestion. However, the work has also generated controversy as several groups have subsequently reported being unable to detect ingested plant miRNAs in mammalian tissues at levels significantly above background5. We addressed this controversy in experiments designed to both detect a therapeutic effect of ingested miRNAs and to demonstrate their uptake.Here we report that oral administration of a cocktail of tumor suppressor miRNAs reduced tumor burden in the well-established ApcMin/+ mouse model of colon cancer. The cocktail contains three validated tumor suppressor miRNAs (miR-34a, miR-143, and miR-145), synthesized with the exact nucleotide sequence of the mouse miRNAs, but with a methyl group on the 2′ position of the ribose of the 3′ terminal nucleotide, which is a characteristic of miRNAs made by plants6. These three miRNAs are all downregulated in colon cancer, and block tumorigenesis in animal models when their levels are restored7,8,9. Three groups of seven mice each were tested in a preventive regimen (gavage starting at 5 weeks and continuing for 28 days) to determine the effect of treatment on tumor burden. The experimental group received total plant RNA spiked with the three tumor suppressor miRNAs. Two negative control groups received either total plant RNA alone or water. To assess the effect of the treatments on the overall health of the mice, their weights were monitored daily. All mice remained healthy and gained weight during the course of the experiment, indicating no obvious toxicity. On day 28, the tumor burden in each mouse was determined. Additional details of the methods and analyses are described in Supplementary information, Data S1.To establish whether the miRNA-treated group had significantly fewer tumors than the control groups, we used a nonparametric statistical analysis, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test. Figure 1A shows the number of tumors for each mouse in the three different groups and a plot of those numbers for the miRNA-treated and water-treated groups. A one-sided K-S test shows a highly significant reduction in tumor burden in the miRNA-treated mice compared to the water-treated mice (P = 0.0058). The K-S plot highlights a striking feature of our data, which is that six of the seven mice in the tumor suppressor miRNA-treated group had fewer tumors than the mouse with the fewest tumors in the water-treated group. The tumor burden in the mice treated with total plant RNA alone was less than that in the water-treated mice, suggesting that plant RNA alone may have a therapeutic effect. However, these two groups were not statistically different (P = 0.28), and a larger sample size would be required to evaluate the therapeutic potential of plant RNA. Figure 1B shows the average number of tumors in the three groups.Figure 1Orally administered tumor suppressor miRNAs reduce tumor burden in ApcMin/+ mice and are detectable in intestinal tissue. (A) Reduction in tumor burden in miRNA-treated compared to water-treated mice. The table shows the number of tumors in each mouse in the three groups listed in ascending order within each group: miRNA = tumor suppressor miRNA cocktail + total plant RNA; RNA = total plant RNA alone; water = only water. The number of tumors from mice in the miRNA-treated and water-treated groups were plotted to show the distributions that are the basis of the K-S statistical analysis. (B) Mean number of tumors in each treatment group. Error bars show the standard error of the mean. (C, D). Total RNA isolated from intestinal tissue of the mice was oxidized with sodium periodate, and miRNAs were assayed using the miScript-PCR system (Qiagen), which involves polyadenylation of the RNA, reverse transcription, and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Because periodate oxidizes all endogenous RNA controls in the samples, methylated C. elegans miR-39 was added to all samples before oxidation to serve as the normalization control. MiScript-PCR system analysis of samples before oxidation showed that the concentration of the spiked-in miR-39 was the same in all samples. RT-qPCR results showing higher relative miR-34a concentration in miRNA-treated mice compared to water-treated mice. The mean relative miR-34a and miR-100 concentrations in the miRNA-treated and water-treated mice are shown. Error bars are the standard error of the mean (C). Visualization of RT-qPCR products to confirm that a single product of the expected size was amplified in the reactions that assayed miR-34a, miR-100, and miR-39 in intestinal RNA from miRNA-treated and water-treated mice. The RT-qPCR reactions were performed in triplicate, and an aliquot from one of each triplicate was loaded on a 2.5% agarose gel. Each lane represents a sample from an individual mouse: miRNA, samples from miRNA-treated mice; water, samples from water-treated mice. The samples were all electrophoresed on one gel that had been poured using two combs. MiR-100 and control miR-39 reactions from the same PCR run were loaded into the upper wells, with the miR-100 reactions in the left half of the gel. Similarly, miR-34a and miR-39 reactions done in another RT-qPCR run were loaded into the lower wells, with the miR-34a reactions in the left half of the gel. A 100-bp ladder provides the size standards. Ethidium bromide was used to stain the gel (D).Full size imageTo determine the levels of administered tumor suppressor miRNAs in mouse intestine, we exploited the fact that the synthesized miRNAs used in our experiment, like plant-produced miRNAs, are methylated at the 2′ position of the ribose of the 3′ terminal nucleotide, whereas endogenous mouse miRNAs are not. Periodate oxidation of unmethylated miRNA breaks the bond between the 2′ and 3′ carbons of the 3′ terminal ribose10, preventing subsequent in vitro polyadenylation. In contrast, methylated miRNAs are resistant to periodate oxidation, providing a robust method to reduce the background mouse miRNAs and thereby allowing specific quantitation of the orally administered methylated miRNAs. We used periodate oxidation followed by polyadenylation, reverse transcription, and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) to assay the level of miR-34a in intestinal RNA isolated from the mice. Relative miRNA concentrations were calculated from the RT-qPCR results, using the ΔΔCt method. This method is based on differences in the amplification curves of the reactions during the exponential phase of amplification, when starting miRNA concentrations can be accurately measured. The analysis showed with high statistical significance that the level of miR-34a in the miRNA-treated group was higher than that in the water treated-control mice (K-S test, P = 0.0082), with an average increase of about 10-fold (Figure 1C). In contrast, the level of miR-100, an endogenous mouse miRNA that had about the same background level in the intestine as miR-34a, but was not fed to the mice, was not significantly different between the miRNA-treated and water treated-control groups (Figure 1C). To rule out the possibility that the observed difference in miR-34a level between miR-treated and water treated-control groups was due to spurious amplification of unrelated molecules, we analyzed the RT-qPCR products at the end of the reactions using gel electrophoresis (Figure 1D). Because all the amplification curves had reached essentially the same plateau level at this point, the gel does not reflect differences in starting concentrations of the miRNAs. However, it shows that a single product of the expected size was produced in all reactions, indicating that amplification was specific. Unfortunately, specific detection of the administered miR-143 and miR-145 in mouse intestine failed because the background levels of endogenous miR-143 and miR-145 after periodate oxidation were too high.Our results suggest that tumor suppressor miRNAs designed to mimic small RNAs produced in plants were taken up by the digestive tract of ApcMin/+ mice upon ingestion, as evidenced by their higher concentration in the miRNA-treated animals (Figure 1C), and were functional, as evidenced by the reduction in tumor burden (Figure 1A and 1B). These results are consistent with a previous study4 showing that plant miRNAs are taken up by the mammalian digestive tract and can function to target mammalian genes. Our results raise the intriguing prospect of using edible plants engineered to produce mammalian tumor suppressor miRNAs as an effective, nontoxic, and inexpensive chemopreventive strategy in humans. The initial experiments presented here used synthetic mammalian tumor suppressor miRNAs designed to mimic plant-produced miRNAs and tested their uptake and anti-cancer function in the intestine, a tissue with high exposure to dietary RNAs. However, the same basic idea could extend to other miRNA-associated diseases and to the use of novel miRNAs designed for specific targets, such as viral RNAs. Bioengineering of plants to produce miRNAs of any desired sequence is a well-established technology currently used for research purposes in diverse food crops11. Thus, using edible plants to produce therapeutic miRNAs is highly feasible and has significant potential in basic, translational, and clinical applications to provide a cost-effective alternative to currently available synthetic RNA production and delivery methods.Conflict of interestVV has founded a start-up biotechnology company, “MicroRNA Meds, LLC”, that has interests related to this research, and is also primary co-inventor on patents to bioengineer plants to make microRNAs.

"cr","The Integrator complex controls the termination of transcription at diverse classes of gene targets","Complexes containing INTS3 and either NABP1 or NABP2 were initially characterized in DNA damage responses, but their biochemical function remained unknown. Using affinity purifications and HIV Integration targeting-sequencing (HIT-Seq), we find that these complexes are part of the Integrator complex, which binds RNA Polymerase II and regulates specific target genes. Integrator cleaves snRNAs as part of their processing to their mature form in a mechanism that is intimately coupled with transcription termination. However, HIT-Seq reveals that Integrator also binds to the 3′ end of replication-dependent histones and promoter proximal regions of genes with polyadenylated transcripts. Depletion of Integrator subunits results in transcription termination failure, disruption of histone mRNA processing, and polyadenylation of snRNAs and histone mRNAs. Furthermore, promoter proximal binding of Integrator negatively regulates expression of genes whose transcripts are normally polyadenylated. Integrator recruitment to all three gene classes is DSIF-dependent, suggesting that Integrator functions as a termination complex at DSIF-dependent RNA Polymerase II pause sites.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201519"
"cr","Recurrent gain-of-function USP8 mutations in Cushing's disease","Cushing's disease, also known as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-secreting pituitary adenomas (PAs) that cause excess cortisol production, accounts for up to 85% of corticotrophin-dependent Cushing's syndrome cases. However, the genetic alterations in this disease are unclear. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing of DNA derived from 12 ACTH-secreting PAs and matched blood samples, which revealed three types of somatic mutations in a candidate gene, USP8 (encoding ubiquitin-specific protease 8), exclusively in exon 14 in 8 of 12 ACTH-secreting PAs. We further evaluated somatic USP8 mutations in additional 258 PAs by Sanger sequencing. Targeted sequencing further identified a total of 17 types of USP8 variants in 67 of 108 ACTH-secreting PAs (62.04%). However, none of these mutations was detected in other types of PAs (n = 150). These mutations aggregate within the 14-3-3 binding motif of USP8 and disrupt the interaction between USP8 and 14-3-3 protein, resulting in an elevated capacity to protect EGFR from lysosomal degradation. Accordingly, PAs with mutated USP8 display a higher incidence of EGFR expression, elevated EGFR protein abundance and mRNA expression levels of POMC, which encodes the precursor of ACTH. PAs with mutated USP8 are significantly smaller in size and have higher ACTH production than wild-type PAs. In surgically resected primary USP8-mutated tumor cells, USP8 knockdown or blocking EGFR effectively attenuates ACTH secretion. Taken together, somatic gain-of-function USP8 mutations are common and contribute to ACTH overproduction in Cushing's disease. Inhibition of USP8 or EGFR is promising for treating USP8-mutated corticotrophin adenoma. Our study highlights the potentially functional mutated gene in Cushing's disease and provides insights into the therapeutics of this disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201520"
"cr","CD146 acts as a novel receptor for netrin-1 in promoting angiogenesis and vascular development","Angiogenesis, a process that newly-formed blood vessels sprout from pre-existing ones, is vital for vertebrate development and adult homeostasis. Previous studies have demonstrated that the neuronal guidance molecule netrin-1 participates in angiogenesis and morphogenesis of the vascular system. Netrin-1 exhibits dual activities in angiogenesis: either promoting or inhibiting angiogenesis. The anti-angiogenic activity of netrin-1 is mediated by UNC5B receptor. However, how netrin-1 promotes angiogenesis remained unclear. Here we report that CD146, an endothelial transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is a receptor for netrin-1. Netrin-1 binds to CD146 with high affinity, inducing endothelial cell activation and downstream signaling in a CD146-dependent manner. Conditional knockout of the cd146 gene in the murine endothelium or disruption of netrin-CD146 interaction by a specific anti-CD146 antibody blocks or reduces netrin-1-induced angiogenesis. In zebrafish embryos, downregulating either netrin-1a or CD146 results in vascular defects with striking similarity. Moreover, knocking down CD146 blocks ectopic vascular sprouting induced by netrin-1 overexpression. Together, our data uncover CD146 as a previously unknown receptor for netrin-1 and also reveal a functional ligand for CD146 in angiogenesis, demonstrating the involvement of netrin-CD146 signaling in angiogenesis during vertebrate development.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201515"
"cr","SMARCE1 suppresses EGFR expression and controls responses to MET and ALK inhibitors in lung cancer","Recurrent inactivating mutations in components of SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes have been identified across cancer types, supporting their roles as tumor suppressors in modulating oncogenic signaling pathways. We report here that SMARCE1 loss induces EGFR expression and confers resistance to MET and ALK inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). We found that SMARCE1 binds to regulatory regions of the EGFR locus and suppresses EGFR transcription in part through regulating expression of Polycomb Repressive Complex component CBX2. Addition of the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib restores the sensitivity of SMARCE1-knockdown cells to MET and ALK inhibitors in NSCLCs. Our findings link SMARCE1 to EGFR oncogenic signaling and suggest targeted treatment options for SMARCE1-deficient tumors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201516"
"cr","Cationic nanocarriers induce cell necrosis through impairment of Na+/K+-ATPase and cause subsequent inflammatory response","Nanocarriers with positive surface charges are known for their toxicity which has limited their clinical applications. The mechanism underlying their toxicity, such as the induction of inflammatory response, remains largely unknown. In the present study we found that injection of cationic nanocarriers, including cationic liposomes, PEI, and chitosan, led to the rapid appearance of necrotic cells. Cell necrosis induced by cationic nanocarriers is dependent on their positive surface charges, but does not require RIP1 and Mlkl. Instead, intracellular Na+ overload was found to accompany the cell death. Depletion of Na+ in culture medium or pretreatment of cells with the Na+/K+-ATPase cation-binding site inhibitor ouabain, protected cells from cell necrosis. Moreover, treatment with cationic nanocarriers inhibited Na+/K+-ATPase activity both in vitro and in vivo. The computational simulation showed that cationic carriers could interact with cation-binding site of Na+/K+-ATPase. Mice pretreated with a small dose of ouabain showed improved survival after injection of a lethal dose of cationic nanocarriers. Further analyses suggest that cell necrosis induced by cationic nanocarriers and the resulting leakage of mitochondrial DNA could trigger severe inflammation in vivo, which is mediated by a pathway involving TLR9 and MyD88 signaling. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism whereby cationic nanocarriers induce acute cell necrosis through the interaction with Na+/K+-ATPase, with the subsequent exposure of mitochondrial damage-associated molecular patterns as a key event that mediates the inflammatory responses. Our study has important implications for evaluating the biocompatibility of nanocarriers and designing better and safer ones for drug delivery.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20159"
"cr","Characterization and target identification of a DNA aptamer that labels pluripotent stem cells","Aptamers are short stretches of nucleotides or amino-acid residues that are engineered to bind to various targets, from small chemicals to large proteins and live cells1,2,3,4,5. Aptamers are normally selected through a process called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), in which aptamers are selected from a random library of oligonucleotides or peptides against a target through repeated rounds of selection and amplification2. As a versatile affinity reagent, aptamers can be used to modulate the behavior of cells6,7, to detect chemical substances in solution8,9, as alternatives to antibodies5,10 and as therapeutic reagents for human diseases11. As aptamers are chemically synthesized in vitro, they offer a great advantage in selection, production, transportation and storage over traditional antibodies. Also, they can come with many types of chemical modifications, which is useful in cell biology. Although many aptamers have been selected against different tissues and cell types, including mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs)12, aptamers that specifically label human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are still lacking, likely due to the delicate nature of these cells. In this report, we present the first in-depth analysis of a DNA aptamer that specifically labels PSCs. We show that this aptamer can be used as an excellent affinity reagent and functions in hESC enrichment and depletion, and in induced PSC (iPSC) enrichment during reprogramming. We also present a novel approach based on the ratio of epitope expression levels across different cell types to quickly identify binding targets of a given molecule among thousands of proteins on the cell surface, bypassing the need of pull-down experiments and mass spectrometry.We recently performed a whole-cell SELEX on human PSCs (Supplementary information, Data S1) followed by next-generation sequencing13. Using a novel bioinformatics approach, we identified eight potential aptamers that bind to human PSCs13. Here, we aimed to characterize in detail one of the high-affinity aptamers, Apt19, and to explore its application in stem cell biology.We first examined the contribution of constant regions at either end of the aptamer. Constant regions served as primer-binding sites in the PCR amplification of aptamer libraries during selection. Their contribution to the function of a specific aptamer remained unclear. We performed serial truncations in the constant regions of Apt19 (Figure 1A). As shown in Figure 1B, Apt19's affinity to hESCs was slightly enhanced upon a truncation of 5 nucleotides (nt) at both ends. A truncation of 10 nt at both ends significantly increased Apt19's affinity to hESCs (Figure 1B and Supplementary information, Figure S1A). However, a further truncation of the entire constant region at both ends reduced Apt19's affinity to hESCs to background level (Figure 1B and Supplementary information, Figure S1A). These data suggest that the constant region of an aptamer plays a complicated role in its function. Due to its higher affinity and lower synthesis cost, we used Apt19 with 10-nt truncation at both ends in all of our later studies and named this shorter aptamer Apt19S. We also synthesized a scrambled version of Apt19S (Apt19S-SC) to serve as a negative control, which contains the same 5′ and 3′ truncated constant regions but with a scrambled variable region (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). Circular dichroism analysis showed that Apt19S had a much higher signal at 260 nm compared with Apt19S-SC (Supplementary information, Figure S1C), suggesting the presence of G-quadruplex structure14.Figure 1Characterization and target identification of a DNA aptamer for PSCs. (A) Diagram showing the location of truncations made in the constant regions of Apt19. (B) The affinity of aptamers in A towards hESC was measured with flow cytometry (error bar, SEM; n = 3). (C) Different types of PSCs were incubated with FITC-labeled Apt19S (blue) or Apt19S-SC (grey). The fluorescent intensities of the cells were then measured by flow cytometry. Human 293FT cells were used as a negative control. (D) Different types of differentiated human cell types were incubated with FITC-labeled Apt19S (red) and analyzed by flow cytometry. Human ESCs incubated with Apt19S were used as a positive control (black). (E) A mixture of hESCs and human foreskin fibroblast cells were incubated with biotin-labeled Apt19S and FITC-labeled SSEA4 antibody. After incubation, Apt19S was separated from unbound cells by streptavidin-labeled magnetic beads. The fluorescence profiles of the cell mixture before streptavidin beads separation (left) and cells bound to the beads (right) were analyzed by flow cytometry. The number in each plot shows the percentage of SSEA4+ hESCs in the cell mixture. (F) Beads-bound cells in E were expanded in culture and stained for pluripotency markers Pou5f1 and Nanog. Cell nuclei were labeled with DAPI (scale bar, 200 μm). (G) Fluorescently labeled Apt19S was incubated with H1 ESCs, NPCs, TRO cells and IMR90 fibroblast cells. The fluorescent intensity of each cell type was measured by flow cytometry after incubation and presented as the fold changes between H1 cells and other cell types (error bar, SEM; n = 3). (H) Fluorescently labeled Apt19S was incubated with 293FT cells (grey shade), 293FT cells overexpressing ALPL (orange line) or PROM1 (green line). The fluorescent profiles were then measured by flow cytometry. (I) The binding of fluorescently labeled Apt19S (left panel) or an ALPL antibody (right panel) to hESCs treated with siRNAs against either ALPL or BMP4 was analyzed by flow cytometry. (J) Binding of a fluorescently labeled ALPL antibody to hESCs in the presence of increasing amounts of Apt19S was analyzed by flow cytometry.Full size imageWe next tested whether Apt19S's affinity was specific to hESCs. We incubated Apt19S with human iPSCs, mESCs and Rhesus monkey ESCs and found that Apt19S showed significant affinity towards all PSCs tested (Figure 1C). We then tested its affinity to non-PSCs. As shown in Figure 1D, Apt19S's affinity to all non-PSCs tested was much lower compared with that to hESCs. Even trophoblast cells differentiated from hESCs for only 5 days showed a significant drop in Apt19S binding (Figure 1D). Truncation of constant regions did not change the specificity of Apt19 as full-length Apt19 showed similar binding profiles towards different cell types (Supplementary information, Figure S1D and S1E). These results suggest that Apt19S binds specifically to epitopes present on PSCs. This property of Apt19S also opens the possibility of using it as a sorting reagent to separate PSCs from non-PSCs. This application is important in regenerative medicine as contamination of undifferentiated PSCs is a major safety concern in the clinical use of cells derived from PSCs. To test the possibility of using Apt19S in cell separation, we incubated a mixture of human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells and hESCs with a biotinylated Apt19S. After the incubation, we separated Apt19S-labeled cells from the cell mixture with streptavidin-labeled magnetic beads and analyzed cells that bound to the beads (Figure 1E) and those that remained in the solution (unbound cells) (Supplementary information, Figure S1F). As shown in Figure 1E, we obtained hESCs with a purity of > 97% after a single purification with Apt19S from a cell mixture containing only ∼20% of hESCs. We were also able to reduce hESC percentage by 50-fold in the unbound fraction using Apt19S, whereas Apt19S-SC failed to do so (Supplementary information, Figure S1F). Importantly, hESCs purified using this approach could be further expanded in culture and maintained the expression of pluripotency markers (Figure 1F). We then tested whether Apt19S can be used to enrich iPSCs in reprogramming experiments. As shown in Supplementary information, Figure S1G, we were able to get 6-fold more iPSCs using Apt19S-mediated enrichment. Also, the unbound fraction of Apt19S was almost completely void of any iPSCs (Supplementary information, Figure S1H), indicating highly efficient binding of Apt19S to iPSCs. The enriched iPSCs could also be further expanded and still maintained the expression of pluripotency markers (Supplementary information, Figure S1I).To further characterize Apt19S, we sought to identify its target on the cell surface. Target identification of aptamers remains a very challenging task. In place of the traditional affinity pull-down experiments, we decided to use a different approach by taking advantage of the fact that Apt19S has different affinity to different cell types. We first compared the binding affinity of fluorescently labeled Apt19S with progenitor cells derived from hESCs, i.e., neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and trophoblast progenitor (TRO) cells, and terminally differentiated cells, IMR90 fibroblasts, with that to hESCs. We assumed that the fluorescent intensity measured by flow cytometry correlates with the amount of epitopes on the cell surface. As shown in Figure 1G and Supplementary information, Figure S1J, NPCs differentiated for 5 days from hESCs had a comparable amount of epitopes on their surfaces. IMR90 cells had roughly 5-fold less epitopes. TRO cells fall between NPCs and IMR90 cells. Using the fold differences in the binding affinity of Apt19S to different cell types that we obtained from the flow cytometry, we filtered a list of membrane proteins according to their expression levels in each cell type tested. The criteria we used to filter the list are as follows: (1) the gene must have a TPM (transcripts per million) > 5 in hESCs to ensure that it is expressed; (2) the gene must have at least a 5-fold higher expression level in hESCs compared with IMR90; (3) the gene must have at least a 3-fold higher expression level in hESC compared with TRO; and (4) the expression level of the gene in NPCs must be within 3-fold of that in hESCs. We then sorted the filtered membrane genes according to their expression levels in hESCs (Supplementary information, Table S1). The highest ranked gene was ALPL, which encodes alkaline phosphatase. To test whether Apt19S targets ALPL, we overexpressed ALPL in 293FT cells, to which Apt19S does not bind (Figure 1C), and tested the binding of Apt19S to these cells afterwards. Indeed, Apt19S showed substantially increased affinity towards 293FT cells overexpressing ALPL (Figure 1H). This was not due to artifacts of overexpressing membrane proteins as overexpression of another membrane protein, PROM1, did not change the binding affinity of Apt19S to 293FT cells (Figure 1H). To further confirm our finding, we tested whether ALPL knockdown by siRNA would decrease Apt19S's affinity to hESCs. As expected, knockdown of ALPL decreased Apt19S's affinity to hESCs (Figure 1I). The decreased level of the binding affinity correlated with that of ALPL on the cell surface as reflected by ALPL staining (Figure 1I). This decrease was also specific as siRNA targeting BMP4 did not affect Apt19S binding (Figure 1I). However, as ALPL is an enzyme, it is possible that Apt19S binds to its products, not the protein itself. To exclude this possibility, we performed an antibody competition assay. We mixed the anti-ALPL antibody with varying amounts of Apt19S and measured the binding of the antibody to hESCs. As shown in Figure 1J, increasing amounts of Apt19S decreased the antibody's binding to hESCs, suggesting a direct binding between Apt19S and ALPL.The successful identification of ALPL as the target of Apt19S also validates our novel approach for identifying cell surface targets of a given molecule based on epitope expression ratios across cell types. Affinity pull-down followed by mass spectrometry is a robust and the most widely used approach to identify targets of aptamers. However, this approach can be challenging to labs not specialized in biochemistry. First, most targets of aptamers are cell surface proteins. These proteins are notoriously hard to work with due to their high hydrophobicity and low solubility. This often leads to failed pull-down experiments. Second, the amount of proteins obtained in each pull-down experiment is often very low, which makes accurate protein identification through mass spectrometry challenging. In contrast, our approach does not involve protein purification. Based on differential binding affinities of an aptamer to different cell types and the expression profiles of respective genes, we can quickly narrow down the list of candidate targets. The candidates are then evaluated using binding assays. With the increasing number of whole-transcriptome data sets available in the public and the much lowered cost of RNA sequencing, the transcriptome of a given cell type can be easily obtained, which makes our approach economically very favorable. This approach is also not limited to target identification of aptamers; the cell surface target of any biomolecule (growth factors, antibodies, etc.) can be identified in this way. Nevetheless, our approach might not be able to accurately identify the cell surface targets in certain situations. For instance, when the target is not a protein but instead is a posttranslational modification of a protein or small molecules on the cell surface or when mRNA expression level of a certain gene does not reflect its protein level on the cell surface, the new approach will not be able to identify the target so the traditional pull-down approach should be used.In summary, we report here the first well-characterized DNA aptamer that specifically labels PSCs. We showed that this aptamer performs as an excellent affinity reagent in both immunostaining and cell separation. Using a novel approach, we also identified ALPL as a target of the aptamer, which is a well-characterized marker for PSCs. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the aptamer binds cooperatively to another epitope besides ALPL. Our work offers the researchers in the stem cell field a versatile tool and would also expand the use of aptamers in cell biology.Conflict of interestJAT is a founder, stockowner, consultant and board member of Cellular Dynamics International (CDI).","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20157"
"cr","MIWI and piRNA-mediated cleavage of messenger RNAs in mouse testes","The piRNA machinery is known for its role in mediating epigenetic silencing of transposons. Recent studies suggest that this function also involves piRNA-guided cleavage of transposon-derived transcripts. As many piRNAs also appear to have the capacity to target diverse mRNAs, this raises the intriguing possibility that piRNAs may act extensively as siRNAs to degrade specific mRNAs. To directly test this hypothesis, we compared mouse PIWI (MIWI)-associated piRNAs with experimentally identified cleaved mRNA fragments from mouse testes, and observed cleavage sites that predominantly occur at position 10 from the 5′ end of putative targeting piRNAs. We also noted strong biases for U and A residues at nucleotide positions 1 and 10, respectively, in both piRNAs and mRNA fragments, features that resemble the pattern of piRNA amplification by the 'ping-pong' cycle. Through mapping of MIWI-RNA interactions by CLIP-seq and gene expression profiling, we found that many potential piRNA-targeted mRNAs directly interact with MIWI and show elevated expression levels in the testes of Miwi catalytic mutant mice. Reporter-based assays further revealed the importance of base pairing between piRNAs and mRNA targets and the requirement for both the slicer activity and piRNA-loading ability of MIWI in piRNA-mediated target repression. Importantly, we demonstrated that proper turnover of certain key piRNA targets is essential for sperm formation. Together, these findings reveal the siRNA-like function of the piRNA machinery in mouse testes and its central requirement for male germ cell development and maturation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20154"
"cr","Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 functions as the cellular receptor for Clostridium difficile toxin B","As a gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacillus, Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is responsible for severe and fatal pseudomembranous colitis, and poses the most urgent antibiotic resistance threat worldwide. Epidemic C. difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea globally, especially diarrhoea due to the emergence of hypervirulent strains associated with high mortality and morbidity. TcdB, one of the key virulence factors secreted by this bacterium, enters host cells through a poorly understood mechanism to elicit its pathogenic effect. Here we report the first identification of the TcdB cellular receptor, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4). CSPG4 was initially isolated from a whole-genome human shRNAmir library screening, and its role was confirmed by both TALEN- and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene knockout in human cells. CSPG4 is critical for TcdB binding to the cell surface, inducing cytoskeleton disruption and cell death. A direct interaction between the N-terminus of CSPG4 and the C-terminus of TcdB was confirmed, and the soluble peptide of the toxin-binding domain of CSPG4 could protect cells from the action of TcdB. Notably, the complete loss of CSPG4/NG2 decreased TcdB-triggered interleukin-8 induction in mice without significantly affecting animal mortality. Based on both the in vitro and in vivo studies, we propose a dual-receptor model for TcdB endocytosis. The discovery of the first TcdB receptor reveals a previously unsuspected role for CSPG4 and provides a new therapeutic target for the treatment of C. difficile infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014169"
"cr","SUVR2 is involved in transcriptional gene silencing by associating with SNF2-related chromatin-remodeling proteins in Arabidopsis","The SU(VAR)3-9-like histone methyltransferases usually catalyze repressive histone H3K9 methylation and are involved in transcriptional gene silencing in eukaryotic organisms. We identified a putative SU(VAR)3-9-like histone methyltransferase SUVR2 by a forward genetic screen and demonstrated that it is involved in transcriptional gene silencing at genomic loci targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). We found that SUVR2 has no histone methyltransferase activity and the conserved catalytic sites of SUVR2 are dispensable for the function of SUVR2 in transcriptional silencing. SUVR2 forms a complex with its close homolog SUVR1 and associate with three previously uncharacterized SNF2-related chromatin-remodeling proteins CHR19, CHR27, and CHR28. SUVR2 was previously thought to be a component in the RdDM pathway. We demonstrated that SUVR2 contributes to transcriptional gene silencing not only at a subset of RdDM target loci but also at many RdDM-independent target loci. Our study suggests that the involvement of SUVR2 in transcriptional gene silencing is related to nucleosome positioning mediated by its associated chromatin-remodeling proteins.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014156"

"cr","STAT5 programs a distinct subset of GM-CSF-producing T helper cells that is essential for autoimmune neuroinflammation","T helper (TH)-cell subsets, such as TH1 and TH17, mediate inflammation in both peripheral tissues and central nervous system. Here we show that STAT5 is required for T helper-cell pathogenicity in autoimmune neuroinflammation but not in experimental colitis. Although STAT5 promotes regulatory T cell generation and immune suppression, loss of STAT5 in CD4+ T cells resulted in diminished development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Our results showed that loss of encephalitogenic activity of STAT5-deficient autoreactive CD4+ T cells was independent of IFN-γ or interleukin 17 (IL-17) production, but was due to the impaired expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a crucial mediator of T-cell pathogenicity. We further showed that IL-7-activated STAT5 promotes the generation of GM-CSF-producing CD4+ T cells, which were preferentially able to induce more severe EAE than TH17 or TH1 cells. Consistent with GM-CSF-producing cells being a distinct subset of TH cells, the differentiation program of these cells was distinct from that of TH17 or TH1 cells. We further found that IL-3 was secreted in a similar pattern as GM-CSF in this subset of TH cells. In conclusion, the IL-7-STAT5 axis promotes the generation of GM-CSF/IL-3-producing TH cells. These cells display a distinct transcriptional profile and may represent a novel subset of T helper cells which we designate as TH-GM.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014154"
"cr","FTO-dependent demethylation of N6-methyladenosine regulates mRNA splicing and is required for adipogenesis","The role of Fat Mass and Obesity-associated protein (FTO) and its substrate N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNA processing and adipogenesis remains largely unknown. We show that FTO expression and m6A levels are inversely correlated during adipogenesis. FTO depletion blocks differentiation and only catalytically active FTO restores adipogenesis. Transcriptome analyses in combination with m6A-seq revealed that gene expression and mRNA splicing of grouped genes are regulated by FTO. M6A is enriched in exonic regions flanking 5′- and 3′-splice sites, spatially overlapping with mRNA splicing regulatory serine/arginine-rich (SR) protein exonic splicing enhancer binding regions. Enhanced levels of m6A in response to FTO depletion promotes the RNA binding ability of SRSF2 protein, leading to increased inclusion of target exons. FTO controls exonic splicing of adipogenic regulatory factor RUNX1T1 by regulating m6A levels around splice sites and thereby modulates differentiation. These findings provide compelling evidence that FTO-dependent m6A demethylation functions as a novel regulatory mechanism of RNA processing and plays a critical role in the regulation of adipogenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014151"

Leydig cells (LCs) are the primary source of androgen in the mammalian testis, and the prospective identification of stem Leydig cells (SLCs) may offer new opportunities for treating testosterone deficiency. Here, in a transgenic mouse model expressing GFP driven by the Nestin (Nes) promoter, we observed Nes-GFP+ cells located in the testicular interstitial compartment where SLCs normally reside. We showed that these Nes-GFP+ cells expressed LIFR and PDGFR-α, but not LC lineage markers. We further observed that these cells were capable of clonogenic self-renewal and extensive proliferation in vitro and could differentiate into neural or mesenchymal cell lineages, as well as LCs, with the ability to produce testosterone, under defined conditions. Moreover, when transplanted into the testes of LC-disrupted or aging models, the Nes-GFP+ cells colonized the interstitium and partially increased testosterone production, and then accelerated meiotic and post-meiotic germ cell recovery. In addition, we further demonstrated that CD51 might be a putative cell surface marker for SLCs, similar with Nestin. Taken together, these results suggest that Nes-GFP+ cells from the testis have the characteristics of SLCs, and our study would shed new light on developing stem cell replacement therapy for testosterone deficiency.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014149"
"cr","Crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of SWEET transporters","SWEETs represent a novel family of membrane sugar transporters that have been identified in plants, worms, and mammals. They selectively transport mono- or disaccharides across plasma or intracellular membranes, and are involved in a number of essential physiological processes1. The functions of SWEETs are best characterized in plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, AtSWEET1/4/5/7/8/13 mediate glucose efflux1, AtSWEET11/12 function as sucrose transporters2, and AtSWEET17 permeates fructose3,4. These SWEETs are important for the growth and development of plants, and some are hijacked by pathogens or symbionts for their own sugar supply.SWEETs belong to the MtN3 family in plants and SLC50 sugar efflux transporter family in human5. It was predicted that SWEETs comprise seven transmembrane (TM) helices that are folded into two parallel three-helix bundles connected by one central TM1,5. Homologues of SWEETs were recently identified in bacteria5. Each bacterial SWEET monomer consists of three TMs, reminiscent of one three-helix bundle in the eukaryotic SWEETs. Therefore they are named SemiSWEETs. A representative homologue from B. japonicum USDA 110, BjSemiSWEET1, exhibited sucrose transport activity5.In an attempt to understand the molecular basis underlying substrate selectivity and transport mechanism of sugar transporters, we sought to determine the crystal structure of SemiSWEETs. We have focused on BjSemiSWEET1 and its close homologue from T. yellowstonii DSM 11347 (TySemiSWEET). Both homologues gave rise to high-yield and well-behaved recombinant proteins. We were able to crystalize both proteins purified in detergent micelles using hanging-drop diffusion method. However, these crystals never diffracted X-rays beyond 10 Å resolution. Finally, crystals of TySemiSWEET were obtained in the space group P212121 using lipidic cubic phase approach and diffracted X-rays beyond 2.4 Å resolution at BL32XU, SPring-8. The structure of TySemiSWEET was determined by molecular replacement using the recently reported structure of a SemiSWEET protein from L. biflexa (LbSemiSWEET)6 as search model and refined to 2.4 Å resolution (Supplementary information, Figure S1 and Table S1).Six TySemiSWEET molecules that are arranged into three dimers were found in each asymmetric unit (Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Figure S1). While two dimers are arranged in a parallel fashion, the third one is positioned in the opposite orientation, further supporting the dimeric assembly of SemiSWEETs6. Within each dimer, the two parallel protomers that exhibit almost identical conformations are related by 180° rotation around an axis perpendicular to the membrane plane. Within each protomer, TM1 and TM2 are connected by an extended linker (L1-2), and TM3 is positioned between TM1 and TM2 (Figure 1A). Note that the L1-2 linker is enriched with positively charged residues (Supplementary information, Figure S2). According to the “positive-inside rule” and the topological analysis of AtSWEET11, the L1-2 should be located on the cytoplasmic side, which leaves the N-terminus of each protomer on the periplasmic side of the membrane (Figure 1A)6,7.Figure 1Crystal structure of the SemiSWEET from T. yellowstonii (TySemiSWEET) in an occluded conformation.

(B-D) The dimer interface of TySemiSWEET consists of three clusters of H-bonds between residues on TM1 of one protomer and TM2 of the other, including a pair of H-bonds at the extracellular side (B), a pair close to the center of the membrane (C), and an extensive H-bond network on the cytoplasmic side (D). The H-bonds, together with extensive van der Waals contacts between the two protomers, sealed the dimer in an occluded conformation. (E-F) The central cavity of TySemiSWEET is considerably larger than that of LbSemiSWEET. Residues Phe41 from the two protomers of LbSemiSWEET close the central pocket at approximately the midway of the membrane, whereas the corresponding Met47 residues in TySemiSWEET leave enough space for an elongated cavity. A sucrose molecule can be accommodated by TySemiSWEET, but not LbSemiSWEET (right panels). All structure figures were prepared with PyMol10.Full size imageIt is noteworthy that the basic structural and functional unit of the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters is also the 3-helix bundle8. Interestingly, when TM1 and TM2 in each 3-helix bundle are aligned on the same plane, the position of TM3 in SemiSWEETs is on the opposite side to that of the MFS 3-helix bundle (Supplementary information, Figure S3). The difference in the organization of the 3-helix bundles may argue against a common ancestor between SWEET and MFS transporters.The two protomers in each TySemiSWEET dimer enclose a central cavity that is sealed from both sides of the membrane. Therefore, the structure represents an occluded conformation. The dimer interface is mediated through three clusters of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between TM1 of one protomer and TM2 of the other (Figure 1B-1D) as well as extensive van der Waals contacts. Because of the 2-fold symmetry, described here are the interactions on one side of the dimer and the two protomers are named Mol A and Mol B. On the extracellular side, the hydroxyl group of Tyr57 of Mol A-TM1 donates a H-bond to the carboxyl oxygen of Glu63 which demarcates the beginning of TM2 in Mol B (Figure 1B). One helical turn below, Trp54 of Mol A is H-bonded to the side chain of Thr19 on Mol B-TM2 (Figure 1C). On the cytosolic side, an extensive H-bond network exists between the two L1-2 linkers, which appear to serve as the inner gate (Figure 1D). The side chain of Asp38 of Mol A accepts one hydrogen bond from the side chain hydroxyl group of Ser35 and donates two hydrogen bonds to the main chain amides of Arg37 and Asp38 of Mol B. The side chain of Gln26 of Mol A is H-bonded to both the main chain oxygen of Asp38 and the main chain amide of Ser40 of Mol B.TySemiSWEET shares sequence identities of 44.2% and 40.2% with BjSemiSWEET1 and LbSemiSWEET, respectively (Supplementary information, Figure S4). The structure of LbSemiSWEET was also determined in an occluded conformation6. The dimeric structures of TySemiSWEET and LbSemiSWEET can be superimposed with a root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.64 Å over 144 Cα atoms. However, evident difference can be observed in the central pockets of the two highly similar structures (Figure 1E and 1F). The central pocket of TySemiSWEET is 18 Å long, with an overall surface of 463 Å2 and volume of 613 Å3. In contrast, the central pocket of LbSemiSWEET is 11 Å long, with an overall surface of 327 Å2 and volume of 424 Å3. The difference is caused mainly by variation of one amino acid, Met47 in TySemiSWEET versus the corresponding Phe41 in LbSemiSWEET. The bulky side groups of the two Phe41 in LbSemiSWEET dimer close the central pocket in the midway of the membrane, whereas Met47 residues in TySemiSWEET leave enough space for an elongated central pocket (Figure 1E, 1F and Supplementary information, Figure S4).During structural refinement of TySemiSWEET, an extended electron density was seen in the central cavity. The quality of the density is insufficient for accurate identification and assignment of a ligand. Nevertheless, the crystals of TySemiSWEET were obtained in the presence of 20 mM sucrose, and the contour of the electron density is reminiscent of a disaccharide molecule (Supplementary information, Figure S5A). We therefore tentatively built a sucrose molecule into the density. The disaccharide molecule can be accommodated by the surrounding residues in the central pocket (Figure 1E, and Supplementary information, Figure S5B). Notably, all the 16 residues in each protomer that constitute the central pocket are highly conserved, with 10 invariants, between TySemiSWEET and BjSemiSWEET1 (Supplementary information, Figure S5C), indicating a similar central pocket in BjSemiSWEET1, the sucrose transporter. In contrast, the pocket in LbSemiSWEET is too small to accommodate a disaccharide molecule, consistent with its function of being a glucose transporter (Figure 1F, right panel).Structural comparison of TySemiSWEET and LbSemiSWEET provides important clue to understanding substrate selectivity of SemiSWEETs. If the central cavities observed in TySemiSWEET and LbSemiSWEET represent the primary binding site for ligands in SemiSWEETs, two questions immediately stand out. First, is there a second substrate binding site along the transport path? Second, what is the transport mechanism?All the known transporters utilize a general alternating access mechanism which requires the structural shifts of a transporter between at least two conformations, the outward-open and inward-open, to upload and release of the substrate(s) on the two sides of the membrane. The positions of the cavity in TySemiSWEET and LbSemiSWEET, both located closer to the periplasmic side, deviate from those in the known structures of sugar transporters, in which a primary substrate binding site is usually placed in the midway of the membrane8,9. Examination of the transport path of TySemiSWEET and the other two SemiSWEET structures reveals that the cytoplasmic half of the putative transport path is highly hydrophobic, and may not constitute a stable binding site for the highly polar substrate (Supplementary information, Figure S6)6. Notably, the hydrophobic half-path is also observed in the transmembrane domains of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) maltose transporter MalFG. Structures of the maltose transporter were obtained in multiple conformations and a single binding site in the transmembrane domain is identified9. It is possible that TySemiSWEET only contains one substrate binding site as observed in the structure. The enriched hydrophobic residues along the transport path may facilitate the passage of the polar ligand by lowering potential resistance during substrate penetration.The structures of the outward-open and occluded states have been obtained for the SemiSWEETs6. An inward-open structure is yet to be captured to elucidate the alternating access cycle of SemiSWEETs. On top of that, an intriguing and critical question in the study of SemiSWEETs and SWEETs is the driving force for their conformational changes. It remains to be characterized whether SemiSWEETs and SWEETs are facilitative uniporters or secondary active co-transporters. The structures reported here and previously lay out the foundation to address these important questions.The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the accession code 4RNG.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014144"
"cr","The molecular mechanism of SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE in controlling Arabidopsis ovule development","Ovules are essential for plant reproduction and develop into seeds after fertilization. SPOROCYTELESS/NOZZLE (SPL/NZZ) has been known for more than 15 years as an essential factor for ovule development in Arabidopsis, but the biochemical nature of SPL function has remained unsolved. Here, we demonstrate that SPL functions as an adaptor-like transcriptional repressor. We show that SPL recruits TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED (TPL/TPR) co-repressors to inhibit the CINCINNATA (CIN)-like TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PCF (TCP) transcription factors. We reveal that SPL uses its EAR motif at the C-terminal end to recruit TPL/TPRs and its N-terminal part to bind and inhibit the TCPs. We demonstrate that either disruption of TPL/TPRs or overexpression of TCPs partially phenocopies the defects of megasporogenesis in spl. Moreover, disruption of TCPs causes phenotypes that resemble spl-D gain-of-function mutants. These results define the action mechanism for SPL, which along with TPL/TPRs controls ovule development by repressing the activities of key transcription factors. Our findings suggest that a similar gene repression strategy is employed by both plants and fungi to control sporogenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014145"
"cr","N-cadherin prevents the premature differentiation of anterior heart field progenitors in the pharyngeal mesodermal microenvironment","The cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) in the anterior heart field (AHF) are located in the pharyngeal mesoderm (PM), where they expand, migrate and eventually differentiate into major cell types found in the heart, including cardiomyocytes. The mechanisms by which these progenitors are able to expand within the PM microenvironment without premature differentiation remain largely unknown. Through in silico data mining, genetic loss-of-function studies, and in vivo genetic rescue studies, we identified N-cadherin and interaction with canonical Wnt signals as a critical component of the microenvironment that facilitates the expansion of AHF-CPCs in the PM. CPCs in N-cadherin mutant embryos were observed to be less proliferative and undergo premature differentiation in the PM. Notably, the phenotype of N-cadherin deficiency could be partially rescued by activating Wnt signaling, suggesting a delicate functional interaction between the adhesion role of N-cadherin and Wnt signaling in the early PM microenvironment. This study suggests a new mechanism for the early renewal of AHF progenitors where N-cadherin provides additional adhesion for progenitor cells in the PM, thereby allowing Wnt paracrine signals to expand the cells without premature differentiation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014142"
"cr","Discovery of the migrasome, an organelle mediating release of cytoplasmic contents during cell migration","Cells communicate with each other through secreting and releasing proteins and vesicles. Many cells can migrate. In this study, we report the discovery of migracytosis, a cell migration-dependent mechanism for releasing cellular contents, and migrasomes, the vesicular structures that mediate migracytosis. As migrating cells move, they leave long tubular strands, called retraction fibers, behind them. Large vesicles, which contain numerous smaller vesicles, grow on the tips and intersections of retraction fibers. These fibers, which connect the vesicles with the main cell body, eventually break, and the vesicles are released into the extracellular space or directly taken up by surrounding cells. Since the formation of these vesicles is migration-dependent, we named them “migrasomes”. We also found that cytosolic contents can be transported into migrasomes and released from the cell through migrasomes. We named this migration-dependent release mechanism “migracytosis”.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014135"
"cr","Postzygotic single-nucleotide mosaicisms in whole-genome sequences of clinically unremarkable individuals","Postzygotic single-nucleotide mutations (pSNMs) have been studied in cancer and a few other overgrowth human disorders at whole-genome scale and found to play critical roles. However, in clinically unremarkable individuals, pSNMs have never been identified at whole-genome scale largely due to technical difficulties and lack of matched control tissue samples, and thus the genome-wide characteristics of pSNMs remain unknown. We developed a new Bayesian-based mosaic genotyper and a series of effective error filters, using which we were able to identify 17 SNM sites from ∼80× whole-genome sequencing of peripheral blood DNAs from three clinically unremarkable adults. The pSNMs were thoroughly validated using pyrosequencing, Sanger sequencing of individual cloned fragments, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. The mutant allele fraction ranged from 5%-31%. We found that C→T and C→A were the predominant types of postzygotic mutations, similar to the somatic mutation profile in tumor tissues. Simulation data showed that the overall mutation rate was an order of magnitude lower than that in cancer. We detected varied allele fractions of the pSNMs among multiple samples obtained from the same individuals, including blood, saliva, hair follicle, buccal mucosa, urine, and semen samples, indicating that pSNMs could affect multiple sources of somatic cells as well as germ cells. Two of the adults have children who were diagnosed with Dravet syndrome. We identified two non-synonymous pSNMs in SCN1A, a causal gene for Dravet syndrome, from these two unrelated adults and found that the mutant alleles were transmitted to their children, highlighting the clinical importance of detecting pSNMs in genetic counseling.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014131"
"cr","Honeysuckle-encoded atypical microRNA2911 directly targets influenza A viruses","Influenza A viruses (IAVs), particularly H1N1, H5N1 and H7N9, pose a substantial threat to public health worldwide. Here, we report that MIR2911, a honeysuckle (HS)-encoded atypical microRNA, directly targets IAVs with a broad spectrum. MIR2911 is highly stable in HS decoction, and continuous drinking or gavage feeding of HS decoction leads to a significant elevation of the MIR2911 level in mouse peripheral blood and lung. Bioinformatics prediction and a luciferase reporter assay showed that MIR2911 could target various IAVs, including H1N1, H5N1 and H7N9. Synthetic MIR2911 significantly inhibited H1N1-encoded PB2 and NS1 protein expression, but did not affect mutants in which the MIR2911-binding nucleotide sequences were altered. Synthetic MIR2911, extracted RNA from HS decoction and HS decoction all significantly inhibited H1N1 viral replication and rescued viral infection-induced mouse weight loss, but did not affect infection with a mutant virus in which the MIR2911-binding nucleotide sequences of PB2 and NS1 were altered. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of HS decoction on viral replication was abolished by an anti-MIR2911 antagomir, indicating that the physiological concentration of MIR2911 in HS decoction could directly and sufficiently suppress H1N1 viral replication. MIR2911 also inhibited H5N1 and H7N9 viral replication in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, administration of MIR2911 or HS decoction dramatically reduced mouse mortality caused by H5N1 infection. Our results demonstrate that MIR2911 is the first active component identified in Traditional Chinese Medicine to directly target various IAVs and may represent a novel type of natural product that effectively suppresses viral infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014130"
"cr","Taspase1 cleaves MLL1 to activate cyclin E for HER2/neu breast tumorigenesis","Taspase1, a highly conserved threonine protease, cleaves nuclear transcriptional regulators mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL, MLL1), MLL2, TFIIA, and ALF to orchestrate a wide variety of biological processes. In vitro studies thus far demonstrated that Taspase1 plays important roles in the proliferation of various cancer cell lines, including HER2-positive breast cancer cells. To investigate the role of Taspase1 in breast tumorigenesis in vivo, we deleted Taspase1 from mouse mammary glands by generating MMTV-neu;MMTV-cre;Tasp1F/− mice. We demonstrate that initiation of MMTV-neu- but not MMTV-wnt-driven breast cancer is blocked in the absence of Taspase1. Importantly, Taspase1 loss alone neither impacts normal development nor pregnancy physiology of the mammary gland. In mammary glands Taspase1 deficiency abrogates MMTV-neu-induced cyclins E and A expression, thereby preventing tumorigenesis. The mechanisms were explored in HER2-positive breast cancer cell line BT474 and HER2-transformed MCF10A cells and validated using knockdown-resistant Taspase1. As Taspase1 was shown to cleave MLL which forms complexes with E2F transcription factors to regulate Cyclins E, A, and B expression in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we investigated whether the cleavage of MLL by Taspase1 constitutes an essential in vivo axis for HER2/neu-induced mammary tumorigenesis. To this end, we generated MMTV-neu;MLLnc/nc transgenic mice that carry homozygous non-cleavable MLL alleles. Remarkably, these mice are also protected from HER2/neu-driven breast tumorigenesis. Hence, MLL is the primary Taspase1 substrate whose cleavage is required for MMTV-neu-induced tumor formation. As Taspase1 plays critical roles in breast cancer pathology, it may serve as a therapeutic target for HER2-positive human breast cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014129"
"cr","Large-field high-resolution two-photon digital scanned light-sheet microscopy","Recent advent of light-sheet fluorescent microscopy (LSFM) has revolutionized three-dimensional biological imaging with high temporal resolution and minimal photodamage, enabling long-term fluorescence imaging of tissues and small organisms1,2. By combining two-photon fluorescence excitation with LSFM, Truong et al.3 have created a two-photon digital scanned light-sheet microscope (2P-DSLM), allowing for deep-tissue imaging of highly scattering Drosophila embryos and fast beating hearts of zebrafish. Similar to classical LSFM configurations, a 2P-DSLM uses a low numerical aperture (NA < 0.1) to achieve a long and homogenous illumination. This leads to a thick light sheet and thus reduces axial resolution and image contrast. On the other hand, Betzig and colleagues have used a Bessel beam to generate thin single-photon light sheet that yields superb axial resolution4. However, the field of view and the penetration depth are limited in such system.To achieve high axial resolution (thin light sheet) and large field of view simultaneously, here we have developed a novel two-photon three-axis digital scanned light-sheet microscope (2P3A-DSLM) based on ultrafast axial scanning of illumination focal spot with a tunable acoustic gradient (TAG) index device. This new technique provides a sub-micron axial resolution, a large field of view of 170 × 170 μm2 in deep tissues, and a high temporal resolution limited only by the detection camera. In vivo imaging with 2P3A-DSLM resolved subcellular structures and dynamic processes in small organisms.A schematic illustration and configuration of the 2P3A-DSLM is shown in Figure 1A. A TAG lens uses acoustic wave to radially excite a fluid-filled cylindrical cavity and produce continuous changes in refractive power that enables rapid change of its axial focal plane within 10 μs5,6. Here we used the TAG lens to rapidly translate the focal spot of a femtosecond laser (140 fs, repetition rate, 80 MHz, Chameleon Version II, Coherent) along the optics axis (x-direction) in front of the illumination objective (40× NA 0.8, Nikon). A galvo scanning mirror (GSM) was used to scan the laser beam vertically to the axis of the illumination objective (y-direction). By driving the TAG lens to refocus at ∼450 kHz and the GSM at 1 kHz, we were able to create an ultra-thin scanned 2P light sheet within one millisecond. The size of the scanned light sheet can be modulated by adjusting the modulation intensity of the TAG (x-direction) and scanning amplitude of the galvo mirrors (y-direction) (Figure 1B-1D). During the fast axial scanning of the TAG lens, the sinusoidal motion of the focal spot along axial position and the change of illumination NA result in the uneven illumination of the light sheet. To compensate the unevenness, we used an ultra-fast Pockels cell (Conoptics, 350-160LA) to dynamically adjust illumination power and effectively remove non-uniform illumination along the axial axis (Supplementary information, Figure S1A-S1H).Figure 1(A) A schematic illustration of 2P3A-DSLM. We used a commercial Ti-sapphire femtosecond laser (Chameleon Version II, Coherent) as the illumination light source, and expanded the beam by a pair of concave mirrors. The focal length of the TAG lens was modulated sinusoidally at frequency of 100-500 kHz (diopter, ±30), which rapidly scanned the laser focus along the optics axis (x-direction) in front of the illumination objective (IO, 40× NA 0.8, Nikon). The GSM scanned the laser beam vertically to the illumination objective (y-direction). The TAG and the GSM were positioned at two conjugate planes of the back focal plane (BFP) of the illumination objective by L1 (50 mm), L2 (100 mm), L3 (100 mm) and L4 (200 mm). This configuration minimized the distortion and divergence of illumination intensity during scanning. The detection objective (DO, 40× NA 0.8, Nikon), emission filter, tube lens (200 mm) and sCMOS camera (flash 4.0, 2 048 × 2 048, Hamamatsu) were carefully aligned to record fluorescence images. A USB-controlled 3D stage (Thorlabs, MT3-Z8) combined with a fast Piezo Z-stepper (Edmund, Nanopositioning Piezo) was used to translate the sample for fast 3D imaging. The structure of a TAG len is given in the inset5,6. EF, emission filter; TL, tunable lens. (B-D) Tailorable light sheet size from less than 10 × 10 μm2 to 170 × 170 μm2 driven by intensity modulation of the TAG. (E) The DOF was linearly related with the increase of TAG modulation intensity. (F) The thickness of the light sheet at the near-end and the middle remained nearly constant below 1 μm, while the thickness at the far-end increased to 1.5 μm when DOF reached 170 μm. (G) The axial resolution is below 1 μm under all circumstances except at the far-end of the 170 μm DOF (TAG modulation, 35%).

Dividing chromosomes within single nucleus were clearly resolved; (L) The fluorescence profile of the red line imposed on the chromosome shown in K. Images in H, J and K were deconvolved using ImageJ RL algorithm. Scale bar: 100 μm (B-D), 20 μm (H), 50 μm (J) and 5 μm (K).Full size imageWe quantified the performance of our system by imaging FITC solution (Figure 1B-1F and Supplementary information, Figure S1A-S1H). The depth of field (DOF) along x-direction was found to linearly increase up to 170 μm when the modulation intensity of the TAG was increased to 35% (Figure 1E). The light-sheet thickness at the beginning and in the middle remained nearly constant below 1 μm while the DOF varied between 5 and 170 μm (Figure 1F and Supplementary information, Figure S1B-S1E). At 35% TAG modulation intensity, the thickness of the light sheet at the far-end of the 170 μm DOF was increased to 1.5 μm, still less than that of common LSM configurations (2∼8 μm) (Figure 1F and Supplementary information, Figure S1D)7. Because the infinity-correction range of the illumination objective is limited, the light sheet abruptly expanded in z-direction at TAG modulation intensity > 35% (Supplementary information, Figure S1E). Larger tunable range of DOF could be obtained by using an illumination objective with low NA and magnification (Supplementary information, Figure S1I-S1K), but it would increase the thickness of light sheet and sacrifice the spatial resolution of the system (Supplementary information, Figure S1L).We evaluated the axial (y-z plane) and lateral (x-y plane) resolution of the system at different TAG modulations by measuring fluorescence beads embedded in agarose gel (Figure 1G and Supplementary information, Figure S1M-S1N). The lateral FWHM of beads ranged between 420 nm and 450 nm at different TAG modulation intensities in the whole excitation field, close to the Abbe limit (Supplementary information, Figure S1M-S1N). The axial FWHM of beads at the near-end and the middle of the excitation field were maintained around 700∼800 nm when TAG modulation changed from 0% to 35% (Figure 1G). The axial resolution at the far-end of the excitation field was kept below 1 μm except at TAG modulation of 35% (Figure 1G). These experimental data agree with the theoretical analysis (Supplementary information, Figure S1L), indicating that our system provides better resolution than conventional light-sheet microscopy and even two-photon laser scanning microscopy (2P-LSM) with a higher NA objective3.Next we tested its performance in biological studies by imaging subcellular structures and dynamics in vivo. Mitochondria are pivotal membrane-bound organelles in eukaryotic cells that range from 0.5 to 1 μm in diameter. Single mitochondrion produces transient superoxide bursts known as “mitochondrial flashes” (mitoflashes) in live cells8,9. Here we monitored time-lapse dynamics of mitochondria in the pharynx of mt-cpYFP transgenic C. elegans on adult day 3 (Figure 1H and Supplementary information, Movie S1). With images of 2 048 × 2 048 pixels recorded at 5 Hz frame rate, we were able to resolve splits in mitoflash peaks during its progression (Figure 1I). At 820 Hz frame rate with 2 048 × 256 pixels frame size, we succeeded in imaging “calcium nanosparks” in the dyadic space of a single cultured mouse cardiac myocyte10 (Supplementary information, Figure S1O-S1Q and Movie S2).Due to the small size of chromosomes, resolving chromosomal segregation during cell division in cultured single cells or at the earlier stage of embryo development usually requires high-NA, high-magnification objectives. Using 2P3A-DSLM, we were able to visualize hundreds of nuclei in the heart of a day 3 zebrafish simultaneously. Chromosome structures from a few dividing cells could be well resolved due to the extremely thin light sheet, low background and high contrast provided by the new imaging method (Figure 1J, 1K and Supplementary information, Movie S3).Low light exposure is pivotal for the long-term imaging of biological samples. By continuous three-dimensional imaging of mt-cpYFP transgenic C. elegans, we compared the photobleaching of the 2P3A-DSLM system with a conventional 2P-LSM system. No significant bleaching was visible in our system after 15 min of recording, which is in sharp contrast to > 50% bleaching on the 2P-LSM setup (Supplementary information, Figure S1R-S1X and Movie S4). This is mainly due to the fact that for the same PSF axial stretch (Supplementary information, Figure S1R) and signal rate, the 2P3A-DSLM requires a lower illumination NA, thus reducing the peak intensity of the excitation light and minimizing the supra-quadratic photodamage (Supplementary information, Figure S1R-S1X)3. In addition, we did theoretical comparison of the photodamage among 2P3A-DSLM, 2P-DSLM and static light-sheet microscopy. For the same signal rate, 2P3A-DSLM shows lower linear photodamage, equal quadratic photodamage, and higher supra-quadratic photodamage, compared with 2P-DSLM and static light-sheet microscopy (Supplementary information, Figure S1Y).In summary, our newly developed 2P3A-DSLM combines large field of view, minimal photobleaching, and high axial and temporal resolution with deep-tissue imaging. We demonstrate its superior performance by resolving subcellular structures and tracking single-mitochondrion dynamic processes in live model organisms.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014124"

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we observed an increased secretion of miR-214 in various types of human cancers and mouse tumor models. Tumor-secreted miR-214 was sufficiently delivered into recipient T cells by microvesicles (MVs). In targeted mouse peripheral CD4+ T cells, tumor-derived miR-214 efficiently downregulated phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and promoted Treg expansion. The miR-214-induced Tregs secreted higher levels of IL-10 and promoted tumor growth in nude mice. Furthermore, in vivo studies indicated that Treg expansion mediated by cancer cell-secreted miR-214 resulted in enhanced immune suppression and tumor implantation/growth in mice. The MV delivery of anti-miR-214 antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) into mice implanted with tumors blocked Treg expansion and tumor growth. Our study reveals a novel mechanism through which cancer cell actively manipulates immune response via promoting Treg expansion.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014121"
"cr","Liver Med23 ablation improves glucose and lipid metabolism through modulating FOXO1 activity","Mediator complex is a molecular hub integrating signaling, transcription factors, and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) machinery. Mediator MED23 is involved in adipogenesis and smooth muscle cell differentiation, suggesting its role in energy homeostasis. Here, through the generation and analysis of a liver-specific Med23-knockout mouse, we found that liver Med23 deletion improved glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as insulin responsiveness, and prevented diet-induced obesity. Remarkably, acute hepatic Med23 knockdown in db/db mice significantly improved the lipid profile and glucose tolerance. Mechanistically, MED23 participates in gluconeogenesis and cholesterol synthesis through modulating the transcriptional activity of FOXO1, a key metabolic transcription factor. Indeed, hepatic Med23 deletion impaired the Mediator and RNAPII recruitment and attenuated the expression of FOXO1 target genes. Moreover, this functional interaction between FOXO1 and MED23 is evolutionarily conserved, as the in vivo activities of dFOXO in larval fat body and in adult wing can be partially blocked by Med23 knockdown in Drosophila. Collectively, our data revealed Mediator MED23 as a novel regulator for energy homeostasis, suggesting potential therapeutic strategies against metabolic diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014120"
"cr","H3K4me3 epigenomic landscape derived from ChIP-Seq of 1 000 mouse early embryonic cells","Epigenetic regulation is crucial to the establishment and maintenance of the identity of a cell. Recent studies suggest that transcription is implemented amongst a mixture of various histone modifications1. It has also been recognized that to interrogate function of genetic information, comprehensively systematic profiling of the epigenome in multiple cell stages and types is required2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) has become one of the most critical assays to investigate the complex DNA-protein interactions3. Combined with profiling technologies such as microarrays (ChIP-on-chip) or high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq), this assay becomes a great tool to study the epigenetic regulatory networks in cells4,5,6. However, the ChIP process produces limited amount of DNA due to the low yield of antibody pull-down, DNA damage during fragmentation and cleavage of DNA-protein complex, and complicated downstream analysis7. The conventional approaches have to consume a considerable amount of samples, typically 106 - 107 cells, to overcome this low-yield issue and obtain reliable results5. This limitation also restricts ChIP applications from precious primary tissue samples such as early embryonic cells or rare tumor stem cells.ChIP-Seq, compared with ChIP-on-Chip, deeply sequences the target DNA fragments and generates highly comprehensive data with higher resolution, fewer artifacts, greater coverage and larger dynamic range6. Although recent application of automated microfluidic ChIP (AutoChIP) was successfully performed using 2 000 cells through locus-specific analysis by qPCR8, such assays do not achieve the comprehensiveness afforded by DNA sequencing approaches. Recently, several approaches have been developed to perform ChIP-Seq using as low as 10 000 or even only 5 000 cells7,9,10,11,14. However, all of these methods rely on ChIP reactions in tens of microliters and preamplification of ChIP product before sequencing library preparation, either through linear amplification (by in vitro transcription) or exponential amplification (by PCR), both of which potentially introduce significant bias. Adli et al.7 reported a modified protocol to realize the ChIP-Seq using 10 000 cells by revising the random primers used in amplification to reduce the primer self-annealing, with an optimized PCR condition to cover the GC-rich regions. Ng et al.14 developed another protocol to perform ChIP-Seq of H3K4me3 modification using 10 000 mouse primordial germ cells, requiring pre-amplification before the sequencing library preparation. Sachs et al.15 reported a chromatin immunoprecipitation study with low number of cells without pre-amplification, however, it needs at least 50 000 cells as starting material. Here we present a new method that implements a microfluidic device to facilitate the ChIP process, providing a technology to obtain the high-quality ChIP-Seq data from merely 1 000 mammalian cells, with no need of pre-amplification. The whole ChIP process has been greatly shortened to 8 h. Through this method, we have accomplished, for the first time, a rapid, semi-automated, and highly sensitive ChIP assay to investigate the genome-wide landscape of histone modification H3K4me3 using 1 000 mouse epiblast cells at E6.5, and found that the H3K4me3 landscape of post-implantation epiblast is more similar to that of the mEpiSCs than that of mESCs.Microfluidic devices are the ideal reaction systems for handling small number of cells. We fabricated our PDMS-based device to treat four samples in parallel on a single chip (Figure 1A). Each reaction pipeline could accept no more than 1 200 cells. We first performed the whole ChIP assay on a microfluidic device, including trapping the magnetic beads that pre-incubated with antibody, binding of the sonicated chromatin fragments with H3K4me3 to the beads, and washing away the chromatin fragments without H3K4me3 modification. Alternatively, the micro-device can be used for fragmentation of chromatins through micrococcal nuclease (MNase) treatment on chip, after the cell permeabilization. After the enrichment we collected the DNA out of the device and finished the sequencing library construction in microcentrifuge tubes. We eliminated preamplification of the ChIP product. Instead, we combined the end-repair, adenylation, and ligation steps in a one-tube reaction and then used carrier DNA to facilitate high-efficiency purification of the ligated DNA product. Then we used PCR to amplify these ligated DNAs to get nanogram amount of DNA for sequencing. Conventionally, the experimental process is tedious, taking at least two days to complete the sample treatment3. However, our new protocol can greatly accelerate the whole process; the complete experimental procedure, including microfluidic-based cell permeabilization, chromatin fragmentation, antibody pull-down, and many washing steps, can be completed within 8 h.Figure 1Microfluidic device and the ChIP-Seq from 1 000 mEpiSCs, 1 000 mESCs and epiblast cells of the E6.5 mouse embryos.

(I) Heatmap showing read distribution around TSS regions of different transcripts ranked by the FPKM.Full size imageWe compared two approache for chromatin fragmentation, ultrasonic shearing and MNase digestion, and mainly used the former approach in our experiments since the result was more robust. The fragmentation step could be performed off-chip using the probe-free sonicator. 10 μl formaldehyde-crosslinked cell suspension was fragmented by the ultrasonic. Then the fragmented chromatin suspension was concentrated from 10 μl to 1 μl by evaporation.Since the starting material is very limited and the reaction yield is intrinsically low, even losing a small fraction of the target DNA8 would potentially compromise sequencing efforts. We hence carefully designed the microfluidic channels to sequentially perform the necessary reactions without losing target DNA. We implement the dead-end filling method12 to transfer the chromatin fragments into a ring-shape chamber to react with antibody-coated beads (Figure 1B). Dead-end filling was practical because PDMS was gas permeable; the air in the ring-chambers was expelled and replaced by liquid within a few minutes. Integrated 3-valve peristaltic pumps circulate the liquid in the ring chambers, facilitating the immunoprecipitation. This step is the most challenging practice in traditional ChIP assays. The challenges come from the incomplete crosslinking, nonspecific adsorption, low-efficiency chromatin fragmentation, and low specificity of binding between the antibodies and histone. However, with reduced reaction volume and active mixing, the efficiency of the whole process has been greatly improved. The semi-automated microfluidic control improved the precision and synchronization among all reaction pipelines in the same chip, ensuring the high reproducibility of the assay. We found that the amount of the beads used in an individual assay was also a critical factor. Excess beads elevated the background signals while insufficient beads would decrease the enrichment efficiency.The chromatin-antibody-bead complex was then flushed out of the chip and collected by microcentrifuge tubes. The complex was incubated with proteinase K at 68 °C for 2 h to release the DNA, which was then purified by phenol-chloroform-isoamyalcohol extraction. Precipitated DNA was re-suspended in 10 μl RNase-free H2O, and analyzed by qPCR using the specific primers (Supplemental methods) and by high-throughput sequencing.To quantitatively assess the sensitivity and accuracy of this new protocol, we performed ChIP-Seq of H3K4me3 for mEpiSCs and mESCs from both a bulk amount (106) of cells and from 1 000 cells and compared the results. We found that for mEpiSCs, the ChIP-seq of the two 1 000-cell samples recovered 16 351 and 16 245 out of the 16 929 enriched transcription start site (TSS) regions with H3K4me3 peaks from the bulk sample, and for mESCs, the two 1 000-cell samples recovered 18 256 and 18 206 out of the 18 367 enriched TSS regions from the bulk sample, demonstrating the high sensitivity (on average 96.3% for mEpiSCs and 99.3% for mESCs) of our method. Moreover, 98.3% and 98.4% of the 16 636 and 16 516 enriched TSS regions from the 1 000 mEpiSCs overlapped with those from bulk sample, and 91.0% and 91.7% of the 19 917 and 19 733 enriched TSS regions from the 1 000 mESCs overlapped with those from bulk sample (Figure 1C and Supplementary information, Table S1), exhibiting the high accuracy of our method. The mean correlation coefficient is 0.94 when comparing the H3K4me3 profile of 1 000 mEpiSCs and 106 mEpiSCs, and 0.76 of 1 000 mESCs and 106 mESCs (Supplementary information, Figure S1J), proving the general agreement of the profile based on 1 000 cells of our method and that of standard ChIP-Seq. We plot the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves using the P-value ranked peaks from the 1 000-cell experiments against the positive TSS from the bulk samples (Figure 1D and Supplementary information, Figure S1G), and then calculated the area under curve (AUC) of mEpiSC and mESC as 0.949 and 0.923, indicating our method a good classifier to distinguish positive TSSs from negative ones. These results clearly prove that our method is able to recover a majority of H3K4me3 peaks from as low as 1 000 mammalian cells with a very low false positive rate.Next we tested the robustness of our 1 000-cell ChIP-Seq method. Besides mEpiSCs and mESCs, we also performed ChIP-Seq on two biological replicates of the H3K4me3 marker from the 1 000 epiblast cells of E6.5 mouse embryos. We found that most of the TSS regions that have enrichment peaks are overlapped between these duplicates (Figure 1E). The correlation coefficients (r) of these replicates are 0.884 (epiblast cells of E6.5 mouse embryos), 0.971 (mEpiSCs), and 0.973 (mESCs), which are comparable to the previous report that required 10 000 cells7.Since pluripotent mEpiSC cells were derived from epiblast cells of E6.5 mouse embryos, we asked whether the H3K4me3 landscape of mEpiSCs in vitro was similar to that of E6.5 epiblast in vivo. We found that, in general, the H3K4me3 pattern of mEpiSCs was very similar to that of epiblast from E6.5 embryos. Among the top 10 000 P-value ranked peaks around the TSS regions, 7 000 in mEpiSCs overlapped with those in E6.5 epiblast (Figure 1C). When we compared the mESCs and the E6.5 epiblast cells, the overlapped peak number was 6 680. These proved that the H3K4me3 epigenetic landscape of epiblast cells of E6.5 mouse embryos is more similar to that of mEpiSCs than to that of mESCs as expected.Since H3K4me3 was an active marker for gene expression, we analyzed the transcriptome of mEpiSCs and E6.5 epiblast cells by RNA-Seq. We found that the gene expression profiles of mEpiSCs and E6.5 epiblast cells were very similar as well (r = 0.940) for transcripts with FPKM ≥ 0.1 in at least one of the samples. We compared, in-depth, the ChIP-Seq result at some important gene loci for early embryonic development and found high similarity among epiblast cells of E6.5 mouse embryos, mEpiSCs, and mESCs (Figure 1F). At the same time, we also found the specific gene loci only enriched in mESCs (Figure 1G). Gene ontology terms showed that, compared with mESCs, both epiblast cells of E6.5 mouse embryos and mEpiSCs enriched for the ectodermal differentiation-related characteristics such as neural tube development and neuronal differentiation (Figure 1H). Furthermore, the RNA expression level of the genes clearly correlated with the enrichment of H3K4me3 around their TSS regions both in mEpiSCs and E6.5 epiblast cells (Figure 1I and Supplementary information, Figure S1M). This correlation verifies the previous assumption that EpiSCs are a reliable in vitro model for post-implantation epiblast cells13.In summary, we have developed a highly sensitive ChIP-Seq method by combining microfluidic chip-based chromatin immunoprecipitation with one-tube carrier sequencing library preparation. The integrated device is able to finish the major steps of ChIP, including concentration of the cells from tens of microliters to nanoliters, fixation and permeabilization of the cells, fragmentation of chromatins, binding of the target chromatin fragments onto the beads, as well as the elution of enriched chromatin fragments. Subsequently, without any preamplification, the purified DNA fragments were converted into a sequencing library by a one-tube reaction containing end-repair, adenylation, and ligation followed by carrier PCR. We have demonstrated that this microfluidic-assisted ChIP-Seq method works robustly for as low as 1 000 mammalian cells. We have shown that the quality of H3K4me3 profile acquired by our method from 1 000 cells is comparable to that of traditional approach using bulk materials. Moreover, our method is highly reproducible with the correlation coefficient of the two biological replicates of E6.5 epiblast cells, mEpiSCs and mESCs as high as 0.884, 0.971, and 0.973, respectively. Finally we have demonstrated that the H3K4me3 epigenetic landscape of mEpiSCs is very similar to that of epiblast cells from E6.5 mouse embryos, validating that mEpiSC is an appropriate in vitro model to study the epigenetic regulation of post-implantation epiblast cells in vivo. Our method will permit thorough analysis of the epigenomic landscape of early embryos or other situations in which only a very limited amount of materials are available.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014119"
"cr","Persistent hepatitis C virus infections and hepatopathological manifestations in immune-competent humanized mice","The majority of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection develops chronic infection, which causes steatosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, understanding HCV chronicity and pathogenesis is hampered by its narrow host range, mostly restricted to human and chimpanzee. Recent endeavour to infect a variety of humanized mice has not been able to achieve persistent HCV infection unless the essential innate immune responsive genes are knocked out. Nevertheless, such immune-compromised humanized mice still lacked HCV infection-induced hepatopathogenesis. Here we report that transgenic mice in ICR background harboring both human CD81 and occludin genes (C/OTg) are permissive to HCV infection at a chronicity rate comparable to humans. In this mouse model, HCV accomplishes its replication cycle, leading to sustained viremia and infectivity for more than 12 months post infection with expected fibrotic and cirrhotic progression. Host factors favorable for HCV replication, and inadequate innate immune-response may contribute to the persistence. Lastly, NS3/4 protease inhibitor telaprevir can effectively inhibit de novo RNA synthesis and acute HCV infection of C/OTg mice. Thus, chronic HCV infection with complete replication cycle and hepatopathologic manifestations is recapitulated, for the first time, in immune-competent mice. This model will open a new venue to study the mechanisms of chronic hepatitis C and develop better treatments.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014116"
"cr","Osteogenic fate of hypertrophic chondrocytes","Endochondral bone formation is largely dependent on cartilage lineage cells. The chondrocytes in growth plates continuously undergo a sequential process from proliferation to terminal hypertrophic differentiation1. Once differentiated, hypertrophic chondrocytes elicit multiple functions such as determining bone length, inducing osteogenesis as well as directing bone mineralization, and eventually disappear at the chondro-osseous junction. The fate of the terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes is conceptually important for understanding its role in endochondral bone formation. It has been debated for decades whether the terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes die by apoptosis or undergo osteogenic transdifferentiation, however, clear in vivo evidence is lacking2. Here, through lineage tracing, we provide the first in vivo evidence that the terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes are a potent source of osteoblasts, and retain multi-lineage differentiation potential.First, we generated a novel Col10a1int2-Cre transgenic mouse strain in which Cre expression was under the control of an 8.2 kb promoter and a 3.2 kb 2nd intron of the mouse type X collagen gene (Col10a1), a specific marker for hypertrophic chondrocytes (Figure 1A). In situ hybridization analysis of Col10a1int2-Cre transgenic mice showed that Cre+ cells were exclusively restricted to the hypertrophic zone, but not detectable in the metaphysis and bone marrow cavity from embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) to postnatal day 10 (P10) (Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Figure S1A, S1B). Furthermore, double staining showed that all Cre+ cells co-expressed Col10a1, but not Col1a1 (a marker for osteoblasts), endomucin (a marker for endothelial cells) or perilipin (a marker for adipocytes) (Supplementary information, Figure S1A, S1B). In addition, RT-PCR detected Cre-hGH mRNA in growth plate cartilage, but not in bone marrow or cortical bone of Col10a1int2-Cre transgenic mice (Supplementary information, Figure S1C). These data demonstrate that this Col10a1int2-Cre strain is specific for hypertrophic chondrocytes.Figure 1Multipotential fates of hypertrophic chondrocyte. (A) The transgenic vector contained an 8.2 kb promoter of mouse type X collagen (Col10a1), Cre cDNA, human growth hormone (hGH) polyadenylation signal and a 3.2 kb 2nd intron of Col10a1. Isotopic in situ hybridization assay was used to detect the transgenic Cre mRNA in tibia proximal growth plate from Col10a1int2-Cre transgenic mice at E16.5, P1, P5 and P10. (B) Double staining of YFP (blue) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Cre mRNA (fuchsia) by in situ hybridization in 10-day-old Col10a1int2-Cre;ROSAEYFP tibia. The right panel shows the high-magnification image of the area boxed in red on the left. (C) After 1 and 5 days following tamoxifen administration (50 mg/kg) at P5, Col2a1-CreERT;ROSAEYFP tibia was stained by YFP (blue) and Col1a1 (fuchsia) antibodies. The clonal columns of YFP+ cells were detectable in Col2a1-CreERT;ROSAEYFP chondrocyte zone. (D) After 10 days following tamoxifen administration at P5, Col2a1-CreERT;ROSAEYFP tibia was stained by YFP (blue) antibody, showing a column of YFP+ cells entering into the metaphysis. IHC double staining of YFP (blue) and type I collagen (Col1a1) (fuchsia) showed that some YFP+ cells underneath the growth plate were labeled with Col1a1 (red frames, high-magnification images of areas boxed on the left). (E) After 10 days following tamoxifen administration (50 mg/kg) at P5, Col2a1-CreERT;ROSAConfetti tibia was stained by RFP (fuchsia) antibody. Double staining of RFP (fuchsia) by IHC and Col1a1 (purple grey) mRNA by in situ hybridization showed that some RFP+ cells in metaphysis were Col1a1-positive (red frames, high-magnification images of areas boxed on the left). (F) Double staining of YFP (fuchsia) by IHC and the transcripts of Col1a1 or osteocalcin (Ocn) (blue) by in situ hybridization in metaphyseal, trabecular and cortical bones from 20-day-old Col10a1int2-Cre;ROSAEYFP tibia. The percentages of YFP+Col1a1+ and YFP+Ocn+osteogenic cells in total Col1a1+and Ocn+ cells from 3 images per mouse (n = 3) are shown in the top-right corner. Von Kossa staining showed that some YFP+cells (fuchsia) within the mineralized bone were osteocytes. (G) In 20-day-old Col10a1int2-Cre;ROSAEYFP bone marrow (BM), double immunostaining (left) of YFP (fuchsia) and endomucin (blue, marker for endothelial cells) as well as double immunofluorescence analysis (middle) using YFP (red) and PDGFR-β (green, marker for pericytes) antibodies indicated that some YFP+ cells were adjacent to the endothelial cells and vascular pericytes. Double immunostaining (right) of YFP (fuchsia) and perilipin (blue, marker for adipocytes) showed that some YFP+ cells were adipocytes (red arrow). (H) Triple staining of YFP (blue) and BrdU (brown) by IHC along with Col1a1 mRNA (fuchsia) by in situ hybridization in 20-day-old Col10a1int2-Cre;ROSAEYFP metaphyseal bones (MB). PZ, proliferation zone; HZ, hypertrophic zone; MB, metaphyseal bone; TB, trabecular bone; BM, bone marrow. Scale bars are 200 μm (A-C), 50 μm (D-F) and 25 μm (G, H).Full size imageTo track the in vivo fate and spatial distribution of hypertrophic chondrocytes, we generated double transgenic mice harboring Col10a1int2-Cre and floxed ROSA26-loxP-stop-loxP-EYFP (herein ROSAEYFP) reporter alleles3. Cre-mediated recombination within the reporter locus activates YFP expression and thus indelibly marks the recombined cell and its progeny for their entire lifespan. YFP immunostaining showed that YFP+ chondrocytes occupied the lower hypertrophic zone in Col10a1int2-Cre;ROSAEYFP mice (Figure 1B). Unexpectedly, YFP+ cells were also localized throughout the metaphysis and bone marrow cavity beneath the growth plate where no Cre+ cells resided (Figure 1B and Supplementary information, Figure S1D). At the age of 8 months, YFP+ cells were still visible in metaphyseal, trabecular and cortical bones (Supplementary information, Figure S1D). This result indicates that beneath the growth plate cartilage, there are a considerable number of cells originated from hypertrophic chondrocytes.To further strengthen this observation, we employed an inducible Col2a1-CreERT mouse line where the transgene expression is targeted to committed chondrocytes4. We first confirmed the restricted expression of Col2a1-CreERT in growth plate cartilage from P3 to P15 by in situ hybridization analysis (Supplementary information, Figure S1E). After a single dose of tamoxifen administration at P5, Col2a1-CreERT;ROSAEYFP mice gradually displayed unifying clonal columns of YFP+ cells (Figure 1C). On day 10 after tamoxifen induction, some YFP+ columns clearly extended from proliferating chondrocyte zone to the metaphysis (Figure 1D), implying that the progenies of chondrocytes translocated to metaphysis. Furthermore, we exploited the multicolor Confetti reporter system, a powerful tool for clonal analysis, in which Col2a1-CreERT-mediated recombination randomly activates one of its four reporters (Supplementary information, Figure S1F)5. After 5 days following tamoxifen treatment at P5, we observed the labeled clonal columns with representation of the different colors in the growth plate of Col2a1-CreERT;ROSAConfetti mice (Supplementary information, Figure S1G). On day 10 after tamoxifen exposure, some chondrocyte clones labeled by the same color elongated into metaphysis underneath the growth plate (Figure 1E and Supplementary information, Figure S1H), similar to the findings from the Col2a1-CreERT;ROSAEYFP mice. Taken together, these data strongly indicate that the progenies of chondrocytes entering into metaphysis and bone marrow cavity are still alive and active, raising a possibility that hypertrophic chondrocytes may give rise to other cell types.To determine the YFP+ cell types within metaphysis and bone marrow cavity of Col10a1int2-Cre;ROSAEYFP mice, markers for osteogenic lineage cells and stromal cells were used. At the age of 10 days, 20 days and 8 months, some YFP+ cells presented as osteogenic lineage cells, as evidenced by co-expression of endogenous transcripts of Col1a1, osteocalcin (Ocn) and bone sialoprotein (Bsp), markers for osteoblastic differentiation (Figure 1F and Supplementary information, Figure S1D). Consistent with this, double labeled YFP+Col1a1+ cells were also observed in Col2a1-CreERT;ROSAEYFP mice and Col2a1-CreERT;ROSAConfetti mice (Figure 1D-1E and Supplementary information, Figure S1H). Quantification of the YFP+Col1a1+ proportion in total Col1a1+ osteoblasts in 20-day-old Col10a1int2-Cre;ROSAEYFP mice revealed that YFP+ cells accounted for approximately 31.1%, 21.3% and 18.8% of Col1a1+ cells in metaphyseal, trabecular and cortical bones, respectively (Figure 1F). Von Kossa staining suggested that at the age of 2 months, the YFP+ cells entrapped within the bone were osteocytes (Figure 1F). These data strongly demonstrate that hypertrophic chondrocytes directly give rise to osteoblasts and osteocytes during endochondral bone formation.In addition to the osteogenic fate, hypertrophic chondrocytes exhibited multiple destinies. In the bone marrow of Col10a1int2-Cre;ROSAEYFP mice, some YFP+ cells displayed specific perivascular localization, as evidenced by their enfolding of the endomucin+ vascular endothelial cells and PDGFR-β+ pericytes (Figure 1G and Supplementary information, Figure S1D). Moreover, about 22.5% of the adipocytes labeled by perilipin co-localized with YFP staining (Figure 1G, red arrow), representing another fate of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Importantly, YFP+ cells in metaphysis showed proliferative ability, as evidenced by BrdU incorporation (Figure 1H, red arrow). As expected, some YFP+Col1a1+osteoblasts were BrdU-positive (Figure 1H, red arrow).This study reveals the in vivo mutilpotential cell fates of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Supporting the transdifferentiation hypothesis based on an in vitro experiment 20 years ago6, our results demonstrate that the chondrocyte progeny have the capacity to turn into osteoblasts and osteocytes in the developing bone, providing new insight into the roles of hypertrophic chondrocytes in coupling chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. It is well accepted that by the production of regulatory factors, hypertrophic chondrocytes instruct adjacent perichondrial cells to differentiate into osteoblasts. Unexpectedly, the chondrocyte-to-osteoblast transition verified in our study also points to a direct role of hypertrophic chondrocytes in osteogenesis. Our observations differ from a previous lineage-tracing study that also used the Col2a1-CreERT transgenic line, which showed that chondrocytes do not contribute to the embryonic osteoblast pool7. Besides the different transgenic strains and induction time windows, the apparent discrepancy is probably due to the relatively short time frame of the previous study, which may have missed the ultimate fate of chondrocytes. Recent lineage tracing studies have confirmed that perichondrial osteoblast precursors and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells contribute to trabecular osteoblasts in the developing and adult skeleton, respectively7,8. Here, our findings demonstrate that growth plate chondrocytes provide a new potent source of osteoblasts during bone growth. We also reveal that hypertrophic chondrocytes adopt perivascular cell and adipocyte fates in addition to the osteogenic fate. Given that endochondral ossification is required for hematopoietic stem cell niche formation9, the chondrocyte progeny might not only benefit bone formation but also support hematopoiesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014111"
"cr","Baf250a orchestrates an epigenetic pathway to repress the Nkx2.5-directed contractile cardiomyocyte program in the sinoatrial node","The sinoatrial node (SAN) is essential for rhythmic beating of the heart; however, our understanding of what controls proper functioning of the SAN remains primitive. To explore molecular control of SAN function, we specifically deleted Baf250a, a key regulatory component of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF, in the SAN. Deletion of Baf250a in the SAN led to sinus bradycardia. Time series analysis of dysregulated genes after deletion of Baf250a reveals a transcriptional hierarchy maintaining pacemaker cell identity, i.e., Baf250a activates the expression of Tbx3, and Baf250a, Tbx3 and histone deacetylase 3 coordinately repress the expression of Nkx2.5. Disruption of this repressive pathway switches on expression of Nkx2.5, which stimulates expression of Gata4 and Tbx5. These three cardiac transcription factors further turn on a contractile cardiomyocyte program in the SAN, which eventually leads to sick sinus disease (SSD). Our study suggests that disruption of key genetic pathways regulating cardiac lineage segregation may cause SSD and cardiac arrhythmias in general.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014113"
"cr","Blocking autocrine VEGF signaling by sunitinib, an anti-cancer drug, promotes embryonic stem cell self-renewal and somatic cell reprogramming","Maintaining the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) could be achieved by activating the extrinsic signaling, i.e., the use of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), or blocking the intrinsic differentiation pathways, i.e., the use of GSK3 and MEK inhibitors (2i). Here we found that even in medium supplemented with LIF, mESCs still tend to differentiate toward meso-endoderm lineages after long-term culture and the culture spontaneously secretes vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). Blocking VEGF signaling with sunitinib, an anti-cancer drug and a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor mainly targeting VEGF receptors (VEGFRs), is capable of maintaining the mESCs in the undifferentiated state without the need for feeder cells or LIF. Sunitinib facilitates the derivation of mESCs from blastocysts, and the mESCs maintained in sunitinib-containing medium remain pluripotent and are able to contribute to chimeric mice. Sunitinib also promotes iPSC generation from MEFs with only Oct4. Knocking down VEGFR2 or blocking it with neutralizing antibody mimicks the effect of sunitinib, indicating that blocking VEGF/VEGFR signaling is indeed beneficial to the self-renewal of mESCs. We also found that hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF1α) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are involved in the production of VEGF in mESCs. Blocking both pathways inhibits the expression of VEGF and prevents spontaneous differentiation of mESCs. Interestingly, LIF may also exert its effect by downregulating HIF1α and ER stress pathways and subsequent VEGF expression. These results indicate the existence of an intrinsic differentiation pathway in mESCs by activating the autocrine VEGF signaling. Blocking VEGF signaling with sunitinib or other small molecules help to maintain the mESCs in the ground state of pluripotency.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2014112"
"cr","The catalytic region and PEST domain of PTPN18 distinctly regulate the HER2 phosphorylation and ubiquitination barcodes","The tyrosine phosphorylation barcode encoded in C-terminus of HER2 and its ubiquitination regulate diverse HER2 functions. PTPN18 was reported as a HER2 phosphatase; however, the exact mechanism by which it defines HER2 signaling is not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that PTPN18 regulates HER2-mediated cellular functions through defining both its phosphorylation and ubiquitination barcodes. Enzymologic characterization and three crystal structures of PTPN18 in complex with HER2 phospho-peptides revealed the molecular basis for the recognition between PTPN18 and specific HER2 phosphorylation sites, which assumes two distinct conformations. Unique structural properties of PTPN18 contribute to the regulation of sub-cellular phosphorylation networks downstream of HER2, which are required for inhibition of HER2-mediated cell growth and migration. Whereas the catalytic domain of PTPN18 blocks lysosomal routing and delays the degradation of HER2 by dephosphorylation of HER2 on pY1112, the PEST domain of PTPN18 promotes K48-linked HER2 ubiquitination and its rapid destruction via the proteasome pathway and an HER2 negative feedback loop. In agreement with the negative regulatory role of PTPN18 in HER2 signaling, the HER2/PTPN18 ratio was correlated with breast cancer stage. Taken together, our study presents a structural basis for selective HER2 dephosphorylation, a previously uncharacterized mechanism for HER2 degradation and a novel function for the PTPN18 PEST domain. The new regulatory role of the PEST domain in the ubiquitination pathway will broaden our understanding of the functions of other important PEST domain-containing phosphatases, such as LYP and PTPN12.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201499"
"cr","The willow genome and divergent evolution from poplar after the common genome duplication","Willows (Salix) and poplars (Populus) are known worldwide as woody species with diverse uses1,2. Although these two genera diverged from each other around the early Eocene3, they share numerous traits, including the same chromosome number of 2n = 38 and the common 'Salicoid' genome duplication with a high macrosynteny4,5. However, most willow species flower early in their lives with short, small and sometimes indistinct stems, and thus differ from poplars in their life histories and habits2. In addition, multiple inter- and intrachromosomal rearrangements have been detected involving chromosomal regions present in both lineages6, suggestive of the likely genomic divergence after the common genome duplication.In order to test this hypothesis, we sequenced the genome of a shrub willow S. suchowensis, which flowers within two years1,2. Genome sequencing was conducted with a combined approach using Roche/454 and Illumina/HiSeq-2000 sequencing technologies (Supplementary information, Table S1A and S1B), and the statistics of the genome assembly were listed in Supplementary Table S1C. The size of the S. suchowensis genome was estimated to be ∼425 Mb and ∼429 Mb based on 17-mer analysis and flow cytometry, respectively (Supplementary information, Figure S1A and Table S1D), about 60 Mb smaller than that of P. trichocarpa (approximately 485 ± 10 Mb)4, which is largely consistent with the previous genome measurements of other willow species7. The final length of the assembled sequence was amounted to about 71% (303.8/425 Mb) of the estimated genome size. Sequencing depth distribution showed that ∼94% of the assemblies had greater than 20-fold coverage, ensuring a high level of single-base accuracy (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). A detailed analysis found that the ∼120 Mb of unassembled genomic sequence consisted mainly of repetitive sequences, and the protein-coding regions were assembled to near completeness. The S. suchowensis genome assembly is of comparable quality to other sequenced plant genomes based on next-generation sequencing (Supplementary information, Table S1E). We further evaluated the assembled genome using two independent EST datasets. The first comprises the EST assemblies from various tissues of the sequenced individual, including tender root, young leaves, bark, non-lignified shoot and vegetative buds. The second consists of EST assemblies from flower buds collected from natural willow stands. These two analyses identified 97.6% and 94.2% of the two EST assemblies in our S. suchowensis genome assembly, separately, with > 95% identity and > 50% coverage of query length, confirming the nearly complete coverage of genic regions (Supplementary information, Table S1F). Core eukaryotic genes identified by CEGMA were further mapped to the predicted gene set, and 97.8% of the NCBI euKaryotic clusters of Orthologous Groups (KOGs) are covered by the predicted willow gene set, confirming the nearly completeness of the genic regions by the present genome assembly (Supplementary information, Table S1G). Assessment of the quality of gene prediction revealed that the overall gene length distributions were similar between S. suchowensis and other plant species with genomes sequenced (Supplementary information, Figure S1C).In total, we identified 26 599 putative protein-coding genes (Supplementary information, Table S1H and Data S1), 20 261 of which constitute homolgous gene pairs with the P. trichocarpa reference gene set4. Synteny and collinearity analyses indicate that the chromosomal structures are highly similar between the willow and poplar genomes (Figure 1A and 1B), supporting the concept that these two genera share an additional common (Salicoid) whole genome duplication (WGD) event in their evolutionary history4. Estimation with four-fold synonymous third-codon transversion (4DTv) values of the orthologous pairs suggests that the divergence between Salix and Populus took place around 52 million years ago, approximately 6 million years after the additional WGD. The shared WGD was indicated by sharp peaks in 4DTv values of 0.2842 and 0.2052 for S. suchowensis and P. trichocarpa, respectively (Figure 1C). These different 4DTv values might be caused by different evolutionary rates of nucleotide substitution in these two lineages. Using 1 232 single-copy orthologous genes (Supplementary information, Table S1I), we estimated mean substitution rates of 1.09 × 10−9 and 0.67 × 10−9/site/year for S. suchowensis and P. trichocarpa, respectively. This estimated substitution rate is largely consistent with a previous study of other Salix species based on fewer genes6. Our comparisons suggest that S. suchowensis has a significantly higher substitution rate than P. trichocarpa (P < 2.2e-16). However, substitution rates of both species were substantially lower than those of Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (Figure 1D). The great differences in evolutionary rates between these two species are highly correlated with their flowering habits: the early-flowering species has faster substitution rates than the long-generation one. This finding is consistent with previous expectations8,9.Figure 1Similarity and divergence between the genomes of Salix suchowensis and Populus trichocarpa. (A) Gene collinearity between S. suchowensis and P. trichocarpa. The x-axis corresponds to the Populus chromosomes; and the y-axis corresponds to the Salix scaffolds. (B) Nucleotide alignments between S. suchowensis scaffolds and 19 P. trichocarpa chromosomes. The 19 poplar chromosomes were scaled in their physical length and displayed in a numeric order. For each chromosome, the black bar on the top represents the Populus chromosome, and the black bar under it represents the Salix scaffolds. (C) 4DTv values were separately calculated with paralogs of S. suchowensis and P. trichocarpa, and with orthologs between S. suchowensis and the other four species, including P. trichocarpa, A. thaliana, V. vinifera and O. sativa. (D) The mean substitution rates were estimated using single-copy genes for S. suchowensis, P. trichocarpa, A. thaliana, V. vinifera and O. sativa.Full size imageIn order to confirm that the smaller number of genes annotated in S. suchowensis (26 599) than in P. trichocarpa (40 303) was the result of divergent evolution between the two genera after the common genome duplication, we conducted the following analyses. First, the collapsed sequences may lead to the reduced gene number through the fused assembly of homologous genes with multiple copies into a 'single' one. Under this scenario, the collapsed sequences will manifest themselves to those regions of the assembled genome which have elevated read coverage. In order to determine how this artifact might affect our gene annotation, we analyzed the read coverage across the genome. We found a small number of regions with elevated read coverage, covering approximately 38.8 Mb, indicating the presence of collapsed sequences in the assembled genome. Of these, 19.8 Mb were located in the repeat regions, whereas the genic region contained only 308.2 Kb of sequences, which were correlated with just 315 annotated genes. Thus, the collapsed assembly of homologous genes contributed little to the reduced number of genes in the assembled willow genome in the present study.A second possibility is that Populus retained more gene copies than Salix following genome duplication. To test this, we compared the shrinkage and expansion of gene families within each genome. We extracted the gene family clusters generated by the OrthoMCL pipeline in S. suchowensis and P. trichocarpa. Of the 14 772 gene families shared by the two genomes, 3 434 families contain more genes in poplar than in willow. In contrast, only 627 families contain more genes in willow than in poplar. The remaining 10 711 gene families contain the same number of genes in both species. We found that 1 034 families were unique in P. trichocarpa, while 179 families were specific in S. suchowensis. Comparisons of gene expansions between willow and poplar also suggest that fractions of genes associated with WGD or segmental duplications were higher in poplar than in willow, suggesting that poplar retained more 'Salicoid' duplicates than willow after their divergence (Supplementary information, Table S1J). Even in the families with more genes in willow, these genes were rarely associated with WGD or segmental duplications, but were mainly derived from expansions through lineage-specific tandem duplications and transposons (Supplementary information, Table S1J). These comparisons suggest that willow might have lost more genes than poplar after the common genome duplication.Both gene variation and genome duplication have contributed greatly to our current species and life diversity10. The genomic divergences between willow and poplar illustrated here highlight their divergent evolution since the common genome duplication, which laid the genetic bases for development of their divergence in life history, habit and other traits2. In addition, willows are promising sources for bioenergy crops due to their high biomass yields1. The availability of this willow genome will help improve productivity and quality of such woody crops for biofuel and other uses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201483"
"cr","Quantitative chemical proteomics reveals a Plk1 inhibitor-compromised cell death pathway in human cells","Because multiple cancers require Polo-like kinase (Plk) 1 for survival1,2,3, Plk1 has been investigated intensively as a target for novel anti-cancer agents4,5,6. Although many small molecule Plk1 inhibitors have reached the clinic, our knowledge about their target profiles is limited, because their biochemical properties are determined mostly using in vitro kinase assays. It remains unclear whether this approach reflects the true pharmacodynamic properties of Plk1 inhibitors, since these assays often address only small portions of the human kinome and typically use a recombinant kinase and an artificial substrate. In the present study, for a more comprehensive characterization of the clinical Plk1 inhibitor BI2536, we treated HeLa cells with serial dilutions of this inhibitor. At rising concentrations of up to 100 nM BI2536, we observed a significant mitotic arrest, a high percentage of rounded cells and increasing levels of cell death (Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Figure S1A). Above this drug concentration, the apoptotic activity did not further increase significantly or decreased to a small extend (Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Figure S1A), accompanied by a slight recovery of cell growth (Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Figure S1A, upper panels) and flattening of the cells as seen by microscopical inspection. This observation indicates that the drug response is biphasic and concentration-dependent with a small reduction of apoptosis at high doses compared to concentrations lower than 100 nM.Figure 1Characterization of the mitotic roles of DAPK in Plk1-inihibited HeLa cells. (A) Concentration-dependent proliferative and apoptotic responses upon BI2536 treatment. (B) Evaluation of novel BI2536 targets using in vitro kinase assays. The purified proteins were subjected to kinase assays and the autophosphorylation activities were monitored using γ-32P ATP. (C) TNP-ATP displacement assay for the analysis of BI2536 binding to Plk1 and DAPK. (D) Cells treated with Plk1 siRNA or Plk1-MM siRNA were arrested in G1/S by double thymidine-treatment. At the indicated time points, cells were lysed and immunoblotted for DAPK/pS308, DAPK, Plk1, pH3, Cdk1, Cyclin B1 and β-Actin (upper panel). Cell cycle was analyzed by FACS at the indicated time points (lower panel). (E) Cells were treated with nocodazole for 16 h or transfected with Plk1-MM siRNA as control for 24 h or Plk1 siRNA for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h.

(F) DAPK immunoprecipitated from the lysates of siRNA-treated cells was subjected to kinase assays using GST-MLC as the substrate (left panel) and caspase-3/7 activity was determined (Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay) (right panel). **P < 0.01, Student's t-test, unpaired and two-tailed.

(H) Lysates of cells treated with increasing concentrations of BI2536 for 24 h were immunoblotted for DAPK/pS308, DAPK, CAMKK2/pS511 and β-Actin. (I) DAPK and Plk1 immunoprecipitated from lysates were subjected to kinase assays using GST-MLC and cytoplasmic retention signal (CRS) of cyclin B1 as the substrates, respectively. (J) Cells enriched in mitosis by nocodazole- or nocodazole/MG132-treatment were incubated with increasing concentrations of BI2536 for 24 h. Cell cycle analyses by FACS (upper panel) and immunoblotting (lower panel) were then performed.Full size imageSince the sole inhibition of Plk1 could not account for the improved cell survival at elevated inhibitor concentrations, we investigated whether hitherto unknown targets of BI2536 could contribute to the unexpected apoptotic behavior of cancer cells. To this end, a Kinobead competition assay was applied to the quantitative profiling of the Plk1 inhibitor BI25367,8. Kinobeads captured approximately two-thirds of the expressed kinome (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). Our experiment revealed a very narrow target profile for BI2536: six proteins exhibited > 33% binding reduction on Kinobeads at 250 nM in the lysates (Supplementary information, Table S1 and Figure S1C). Among these newly identified targets, those commercially available kinase proteins were further analyzed in in vitro kinase assays: While at 1 nM, BI2536 interferes with the activity of CDC-like kinase 2 (CLK2) moderately, it is a potent inhibitor of Plk1, death-associated protein kinase 2 (DAPK-2) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2), confirming our results obtained from quantitative mass spectrometry (Figure 1B and Supplementary information, Figure S1B and S1C). Although Kinobeads affinity captures some 300 human kinases7, there are 'blind spots' due to the lack of sufficient affinity of the immobilized ligands towards a particular kinase, or the low expression level of a certain kinase, preventing detection by mass spectrometry. Consequently, Plks are very often not detected using Kinobeads.DAPKs constitute a family of Ser/Thr kinases that share cell death-related functions and have significant sequence homology within their kinase domains9. Hence, we tested the effect of BI2536 also on the activity of DAPK, the best-characterized member of the DAPK family, and observed that BI2536 is efficient in inhibiting DAPK activity in vitro (Figure 1B). To examine the direct binding of BI2536 to DAPK, we performed a displacement assay using the fluorescent ATP analog 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5′-triphosphate (TNP-ATP)10,11. While TNP-ATP displays minimal fluorescence in solution, upon binding to a protein, a significant increase of fluorescence occurs. A reduction in fluorescence was observed upon addition of BI2536 for Plk1 and DAPK in a concentration-dependent manner suggesting the displacement of TNP-ATP from the ATP-binding sites (Figure 1C).Since Plk1 inhibition leads to mitotic arrest in cancer cells followed by an induction of apoptosis, we investigated whether DAPK activity is regulated during cell cycle progression and might contribute to cell death induced by Plk1 inhibition. To follow the course of DAPK expression, cells treated with a Plk1-mismatch (MM) siRNA or a Plk1-specific siRNA were synchronized by double-thymidine treatment and analyzed. The DAPK protein was present throughout the cell cycle (Figure 1D). Previously, it was reported that DAPK is autophosphorylated at S308, which correlates inversely with the ability of DAPK to phosphorylate its substrates12. Dephosphorylation of S308 strongly enhances the death promoting activity of DAP kinase13. While synchronized cells treated with Plk1-MM siRNA showed a transient signal for DAPK/pS308, Plk1-depleted cells that were arrested in mitosis with high levels of cyclin B1 and pH3 showed very strong signals for DAPK/pS308 (Figure 1D), suggesting that the activity of DAPK is auto-inhibited during mitosis. Furthermore, we analyzed the activity of DAPK upon prolonged mitotic arrest induced by Plk1 depletion. In Plk1-MM siRNA -treated, exponentially growing cells, the DAPK/pS308 signal was below the limit of detection (Figure 1E, lane 2 and Supplementary information, Figure S1D, lane 1). In contrast, at 24 h following transfection with Plk1 siRNA, the DAPK/pS308 signal was clearly elevated (Figure 1E, lane 3 and Supplementary information, Figure S1D, lane 2), correlating with an enrichment of mitotic cells (Figure 1E, right panel and Supplementary information, Figure S1D, lower panels). The inhibitory autophosphorylation signal was markedly decreased or completely gone at 72 h (Figure 1E, lanes 4, 5 and Supplementary information, Figure S1D, lanes 3, 4). With a loss in DAPK/pS308 signal intensity (Figure 1E, Supplementary information, Figure S1D), the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated DAPK towards the DAPK substrate myosin light chain (MLC) was markedly increased (Figure 1F, left panel and Supplementary information, Figure S1E, upper panels). In addition, the phosphorylation status of a DAPK substrate, CAMKK2, was analyzed by western blotting using the CAMKK2/pS511 antibody (Figure 1E, left panel, Supplementary information, Figure S1D, upper panels). This experiment confirmed that with decreasing levels of the DAPK/pS308 signal, the activity of DAPK towards its substrates increased, suggesting that during prolonged mitotic arrest a switch of DAPK function occurs from its autophosphorylated, inhibited form to the death-promoting active form of DAPK. During the observation period (0-72 h) a robust increase in apoptotic activity was detected (Figure 1F, right panel and Supplementary information, Figure S1E, lower panels). Next we addressed whether activation of DAPK contributes to cell death induced by Plk1 inhibition. In different cell lines, cell apoptosis induced by Plk1 silencing or BI2536-mediated Plk1 inhibition could be inhibited by co-depletion of DAPK (Figure 1G, Supplementary information, Figure S1F-S1G), suggesting that DAPK is a critical component of the cell death machinery that is activated by Plk1 inhibition.Considering that during prolonged mitotic arrest induced by Plk1 depletion, a switch of DAPK function occurs from its autophosphorylated, inhibited form to the death-promoting, active form of DAPK, we investigated DAPK activity in BI2536-treated cells. While the DAPK/pS308 signal intensity is below the limit of detection in asynchronously growing cells, the treatment with increasing concentrations of BI2536 for 24 h induced a prominent autophosphorylation signal (DAPK/pS308) between 10 and 50 nM BI2536, which decreased at more elevated drug concentrations (Figure 1H, Supplementary information, Figure S1H and S1J). While in asynchronously growing cells, DAPK activity was not detectable, treatment with low concentrations of BI2536 (10-100 nM) induced increasing DAPK activity towards CAMKK2 and GST-MLC (Figure 1H, 1I and Supplementary information, Figure S1H-S1J). In contrast to the use of Plk1 siRNA, which induced persistent DAPK activity towards GST-MLC (Figure 1F), elevated concentrations of BI2536 induced descending DAPK kinase activity (Figure 1I and Supplementary information, Figure S1I), suggesting that elevated concentrations of BI2536 inhibit DAPK activity, thereby preventing the functional switch to the pro-apoptotic form of DAPK. It is worth to note that higher doses are required for the inhibition of both Plk1 and DAPK kinases in in vitro kinase assays using kinases immunoprecipitated from cell lysates (Figure 1I) compared to assays using their highly purified counterparts (Figure 1B).To investigate the effects of BI2536 treatment on DAPK activity during mitosis, we treated cells with nocodazole alone or with a combination of nocodazole and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 to trap cells in mitosis and co-treated mitotic-shake off cells with increasing BI2536 concentrations. The downregulation of the DAPK/pS308 signal in cells trapped in mitosis with stable levels of mitotic markers (Plk1, pH3) confirmed that BI2536 inhibits DAPK activity in mitotic cells and downregulation of the DAPK/pS308 is not a result of mitotic exit (Figure 1J and Supplementary information, Figure S1K). Furthermore, we analyzed the activity of DAPK upon prolonged BI2536 treatment. While the DAPK/pS308 signal was elevated at concentrations of 10-100 nM, but was less intense at 1 000 nM after 24 h treatment, the DAPK/pS308 signal was not detectable at 48 h and 72 h, which might be due to the increasing number of dead cells (Supplementary information, Figure S1L). Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that DAPK undergoes de-phosphorylation during prolonged BI2536-induced arrest, which resembles the effects of Plk1-specific RNAi at 72 h (Figure 1E and Supplementary information, S1D).To analyze DAPK activity in response to other anti-mitotic drugs, we used another Plk1 inhibitor, called BI6727. While the DAPK/pS308 signal intensity was below the limit of detection in asynchronously growing HeLa cells, the treatment with increasing BI6727 concentrations (10-100 nM) for 24 h induced a DAPK/pS308 signal (Supplementary information, Figure S1M). Surprisingly, this signal decreased at more elevated concentrations (Supplementary information, Figure S1M). Since BI6727 is structurally related to BI2536, we tested its impact on the activity of DAPK using in vitro  kinase assays. Compared to BI2536, it was less potent, but still had the ability to suppress DAPK activity partially (Supplementary information, Figure S1N), which could account for the observation of reduced DAPK/pS308 signals at high BI6727 doses (Supplementary information, Figure S1M). Direct binding of BI6727 to DAPK was demonstrated with the TNP-ATP displacement assay (Supplementary information, Figure S1O). Nevertheless, BI6727 showed a lower affinity to DAPK compared to BI2536 (Supplementary information, Figure S1O).Taken together, the present study revealed novel targets of the clinical inhibitor BI2536. We present a previously unknown mitotic regulation of DAPK and its pro-apoptotic activation upon mitotic arrest induced by the Plk1 inhibitors BI2536 and BI6727. A clinical trial using BI6727 for the treatment of patients with solid tumors showed maximum plasma concentrations between 30-2 340 nM depending on the dose given14, indicating that the concentrations used in our study are clinically relevant. Thus, a prerequisite for the design of an optimized cancer therapy is to better understand the kinase selectivity of novel inhibitors. Careful dose-finding studies in cancer trials targeting Plk1 are necessary to prevent the inhibition of DAP kinases, which would counteract the pro-apoptotic effect of Plk1 inhibition.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201486"
"cr","RNF2 is recruited by WASH to ubiquitinate AMBRA1 leading to downregulation of autophagy","WASH (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and SCAR homolog) was identified to function in endosomal sorting via Arp2/3 activation. We previously demonstrated that WASH is a new interactor of BECN1 and present in the BECN1-PIK3C3 complex with AMBRA1. The AMBRA1-DDB1-CUL4A complex is an E3 ligase for K63-linked ubiquitination of BECN1, which is required for starvation-induced autophagy. WASH suppresses autophagy by inhibition of BECN1 ubiquitination. However, how AMBRA1 is regulated during autophagy remains elusive. Here, we found that RNF2 associates with AMBRA1 to act as an E3 ligase to ubiquitinate AMBRA1 via K48 linkage. RNF2 mediates ubiquitination of AMBRA1 at lysine 45. Notably, RNF2 deficiency enhances autophagy induction. Upon autophagy induction, RNF2 potentiates AMBRA1 degradation with the help of WASH. WASH deficiency impairs the association of RNF2 with AMBRA1 to impede AMBRA1 degradation. Our findings reveal another novel layer of regulation of autophagy through WASH recruitment of RNF2 for AMBRA1 degradation leading to downregulation of autophagy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201485"
"cr","Dapper1 promotes autophagy by enhancing the Beclin1-Vps34-Atg14L complex formation","Autophagy is an intracellular degradation process to clear up aggregated proteins or aged and damaged organelles. The Beclin1-Vps34-Atg14L complex is essential for autophagosome formation. However, how the complex formation is regulated is unclear. Here, we show that Dapper1 (Dpr1) acts as a critical regulator of the Beclin1-Vps34-Atg14L complex to promote autophagy. Dpr1 ablation in the central nervous system results in motor coordination defect and accumulation of p62 and ubiquitinated proteins. Dpr1 increases autophagosome formation as indicated by elevated puncta formation of LC3, Atg14L and DFCP1 (Double FYVE-containing protein 1). Conversely, loss of Dpr1 impairs LC3 lipidation and causes p62/SQSTM1 accumulation. Dpr1 directly interacts with Beclin1 and Atg14L and enhances the Beclin1-Vps34 interaction and Vps34 activity. Together, our findings suggest that Dpr1 enhances the Atg14L-Beclin1-Vps34 complex formation to drive autophagy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201484"
"cr","Uterine Rbpj is required for embryonic-uterine orientation and decidual remodeling via Notch pathway-independent and -dependent mechanisms","Coordinated uterine-embryonic axis formation and decidual remodeling are hallmarks of mammalian post-implantation embryo development. Embryonic-uterine orientation is determined at initial implantation and synchronized with decidual development. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling these events remain elusive despite its discovery a long time ago. In the present study, we found that uterine-specific deletion of Rbpj, the nuclear transducer of Notch signaling, resulted in abnormal embryonic-uterine orientation and decidual patterning at post-implantation stages, leading to substantial embryo loss. We further revealed that prior to embryo attachment, Rbpj confers on-time uterine lumen shape transformation via physically interacting with uterine estrogen receptor (ERα) in a Notch pathway-independent manner, which is essential for the initial establishment of embryo orientation in alignment with uterine axis. While at post-implantation stages, Rbpj directly regulates the expression of uterine matrix metalloproteinase in a Notch pathway-dependent manner, which is required for normal post-implantation decidual remodeling. These results demonstrate that uterine Rbpj is essential for normal embryo development via instructing the initial embryonic-uterine orientation and ensuring normal decidual patterning in a stage-specific manner. Our data also substantiate the concept that normal mammalian embryonic-uterine orientation requires proper guidance from developmentally controlled uterine signaling.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201482"
"cr","De novo mutation in ATP6V1B2 impairs lysosome acidification and causes dominant deafness-onychodystrophy syndrome","Dominant deafness-onychodystrophy syndrome (DDOD syndrome; MIM 124480) is characterized mainly by congenital sensorineural hearing loss accompanied by dystrophic or absent nails. Prominent differences between DDOD syndrome and DOORS syndrome (deafness, onychodystrophy, osteodystrophy, mental retardation and seizures; MIM 220500) are the intellectual disability and seizure aspects of DOORS1. TBC1D24 mutations were recently identified as a cause of DOORS syndrome2. To date, six families with DDOD syndrome in various ethnic populations have been reported3. However, the molecular etiology of DDOD remains unknown.We collected three Chinese DDOD pedigrees during the past two years. The probands displayed identical phenotypes including severe congenital sensorineural hearing loss, absence of nails and aplasia of the middle phalanx in the fifth fingers (Figure 1A and 1B). None showed inner ear malformation and intellectual disability. All three individuals had unilateral cochlea implantation at the ages of 2.5, 2 and 18 years, respectively. The successful language rehabilitation in the DDOD probands further confirmed their normal mental development.Figure 1Phenotype and mutation analysis of ATP6V1B2 in DDOD probands and Atp6v1b2-knockdown analysis in the mouse cochlea. (A) Pedigree of three DDOD families and segregation of the c.1516 C>T mutation. (B) Phenotype of onychodystrophy in 3 DDOD pedigrees. Pictures of the hands on the first line show the absence of the fifth finger and thumb nails indicated by black arrows, aplasia of the middle phalanx in the fifth fingers indicated by white arrows, as well as onychodystrophy-like malacia and pitting of the middle three fingernails. The second line, X-ray of the hands shows aplasia of the middle phalanx in the fifth fingers indicated by white arrows. Pictures of the feet on the third line show the absence of all toenails. (C) Partial sequences of exon 14 in ATP6V1B2 from normal-hearing parents and affected DDOD probands 1 and 2, respectively, showing the c.1516 C>T (p.Arg506X) nonsense mutation. (D) Conservation analysis shows that the last six amino acids, p.Arg506, p.Asp507, p.Ser508, p.Ala509, p.Lys510 and p.His511 in ATP6V1B2 are conserved across human, pongo, macaca, mouse, canis, bos taurus, Xenopus and danio. There is a slight exception that Ala509 is missing in the danio sequence and an additional serine residue is inserted in Xenopus sequence. (E) RT-PCR analysis shows intron 12 retention in the Atp6v1b2 transcript of cochlea-specific Atp6v1b2-knockdown mice. The MO was designed to anneal at the junction of intron 12 and exon 13, which resulted in a partial inclusion of intron 12 followed by a stop codon UAA (indicated by the red arrow). The forward RT-PCR primer was in exon 11 and the reverse primer was in intron 12. The RNA was extracted 3 days after MO (0.5 μg/μl) inner ear injection. Since the reverse primer corresponded to intron 12 sequences, no bands were observed in WT or SMO-injected mice. The primer pairs amplified a product of 581 bp, including part of exon 11, exon 12 and part of intron 12 in the presence of abnormal splicing due to the Atp6v1b2-specific MO injection. (F) Hearing thresholds (y-axis) were determined based on ABR measurements at various frequencies (x-axis) for cochlea-specific Atp6v1b2-knockdown mice, SMO-injected control mice and WT mice. ABR thresholds were measured on postnatal day 30 (P30), 4 weeks after cochlea injection. Legends for different mouse groups are shown in the panel, n = the number of ears. Vertical bars represent standard errors of the mean. (G) Flattened whole mount cochlea staining shows the degeneration of hair cells in the Atp6v1b2-knockdown mice. Twenty-one days after cochlea injection with Atp6v1b2-specific MO (0.5 μg/μl), the majority of hair cells in the basal, middle, and apical turns died. Twenty-one days after cochlea injection with SMO (0.5 μg/μl), the hair cells in the basal, middle and apical turns remained normal. Green: Atp6v1b2; red: Phalloidin.Full size imageWhole-exome sequencing was performed in pedigrees 1 and 2, including the probands and their parents (BGI-Shenzhen, China). In each sample, we obtained approximately 5.9-6.9 Gb of data. The data mapped to the targeted region have a mean depth of 145.74 folds, and 99.41% of the targeted bases were covered. For bioinformatics analysis, we focused on variants in coding regions. Variants were filtered by four databases, the 1000 Genomes Project, the HapMap database, the EVS database, and an in-house database from BGI, with the Minor Allele Frequency lower than 0.005. Based on 1) the dominant inheritance of DDOD, 2) the identical phenotype of the two probands, and 3) the pedigree traits (only one individual and neither parent had symptoms), we assumed that there may be a de novo mutation following the dominant inheritance characteristics. After completing such a filtering process, 6 genes with variants shared by the two probands were identified (Supplementary information, Table S1). The 14 variants in the 6 shared genes (CIB1, MUC4, OR5H6, PRAMEF1, AMBN and ATP6V1B2) were then tested by Sanger sequencing. Combining the sequencing results, the prediction results by SIFT, Polyphen, Mutationtaster and the genes' pathway, and their expression in human fetal cochlear EST database, ATP6V1B2 was identified as one potential gene that associates with DDOD. An identical heterozygous de novo c.1516 C>T (p.Arg506X) mutation in ATP6V1B2 was verified in two probands (Figure 1C). The result was further confirmed by Sanger sequencing in another DDOD family (pedigree 3) (data not shown). We then used a restriction enzyme assay to perform a molecular epidemiology analysis of the mutation in 1 053 ethnically matched normal controls. The mutation was not detected in the normal-hearing population (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). Although de novo mutations have recently been shown to play a major role in human diseases with intellectual disability such as Dravet's syndrome, Kabuki syndrome and Schinzel-Giedion syndrome4,5,6,7,8, the identication of a same de novo mutation in 3 unrelated DDOD individuals is extremely rare.The p.Arg506X mutation in ATP6V1B2 inserts a premature stop codon and results in a truncated protein. Conservation analysis of amino acids in 8 ATP6V1B2 orthologs indicates that the last six amino acids, from residues 506 to 511, are highly conserved (Figure 1D). Three-dimensional protein structure modeling suggests that the p.Arg506X mutation results in failure of hydrogen bond formation between Tyr504 and Asp507 in ATP6V1B2 (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). Expression analysis performed by quantitative real-time PCR on total RNA isolated from leukocytes in pedigree 3 showed that the average expression level of ATP6V1B2 in case 3 was comparable to that in her parent controls, indicating that the mutant ATP6V1B2 mRNA is stable. The identification of ATP6V1B2 c.1516 C>T mutation in three independently identified DDOD patients provides evidence that defect in ATP6V1B2 is the genetic etiology for DDOD syndrome.ATP6V1B2 encodes a component of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), which is a multisubunit enzyme mediating acidification of eukaryotic intracellular organelles. V-ATPase is composed of a cytosolic V1 domain responsible for ATP hydrolysis and a transmembrane V0 domain responsible for protein translocation. ATP6V1B2 is one of the two V1 domain B subunit isoforms, and as it is highly expressed in the organ of cerebrum and in the organelle of lysosome, it is usually called a brain isoform or lysosomal V1 subunit B2. Deficiencies of ATP6V1B1 and ATPV0A4 are related to distal renal tubular acidosis and hearing loss9. To the best of our knowledge, no report has linked the function of ATP6V1B2 to hearing. The gene related to DOORS syndrome, TBC1D242, encodes a member of the Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16 (TBC) domain-containing Rab (Ras-related proteins in brain)-specific GTPase-activating proteins, which coordinate Rab proteins and other GTPases for the regulation of membrane trafficking. TBC1D24 and ATP6V1B2 are all known to be widely expressed, most highly in the brain and kidneys. Immunostaining of mouse cochlear sections and cultured cochlear tissues showed Atp6v1b2 expression mainly in the organ of Corti and spiral ganglion neurons (Supplementary information, Figure S1C). This expression pattern was found in both the early postnatal (postnatal day 2, P2) and the adult (P30) cochlea. Tbc1d24 expresses in the stereocilia of hair cells as well as in spiral ganglion neurons10. The identical distribution regions of TBC1D24 and ATP6V1B2 and their function with GTPases or ATPases activity indicate that they may have some physiological link.To investigate the function of ATP6V1B2 in the cochlea, we generated a cochlea-specific Atp6v1b2-knockdown mouse model using morpholino oligomer (MO) (Supplementary information, Data S1). The oligomer was designed to anneal at the junction of intron 12 and exon 13, which resulted in a partial inclusion of intron 12 followed by a stop codon that excluded the expression of exons 13 and 14 in the mRNA (Figure 1E). The Atp6v1b2 MO was microinjected (0.05-5.0 μg/μl) into the scala media of the basal turn of the mouse cochlea before postnatal day 3. Hearing sensitivity has been shown to be unaffected by such an injection procedure11. RT-PCR was used to verify the abnormal transcript product containing part of intron 12 in the mouse cochlea 3 days after injection (Figure 1E). Four weeks post-injection, auditory brainstem response (ABR) tests showed that hearing thresholds in the mice injected with the MO at the concentration of 0.5, 1.25, 2.5 and 5.0 μg/μl were elevated by 30-50 dB compared to wild-type (WT) mice (Figure 1F). However, hearing thresholds in mice injected with 0.05 μg/μl of MO was within the normal range, indicating the dosage-dependence of the hearing loss phenotype. All the mice receiving scrambled MO injection (0.5 μg/μl) displayed normal hearing (Figure 1F). Immunological staining revealed that Atp6v1b2 expression was knocked down significantly in the whole cochlea, especially in hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons (Figure 1G). Western blot analysis showed that 7 days after injection, the level of Atp6v1b2 was decreased distinctly in spiral ganglia neurons and slightly in the organ of Corti, whereas 21 days after injection, the Atp6v1b2 level was significantly decreased in the organ of Corti (Supplementary information, Figure S1D).To evaluate the pathogenicity of the ATP6V1B2 c.1516 C>T mutation, we transfected the pIRES2-EGFP-ATP6V1B2 WT and pIRES2-EGFP-ATP6V1B2 c.1516 C>T mutant plasmids into HEK293 cells. We found that the ATPase hydrolysis activity significantly decreased in the transfected cells when the ratio of the mutant/WT increased. This trend indicates that the c.1516 C>T mutant reduced ATPase hydrolysis activity compared with the WT. The proton transport activity of V-ATPase in lysosomes was measured using a lysosome-specific dye. A statistically significant difference in lysosomal pH was detected between ATP6V1B2 WT- and c.1516 C>T mutant-transfected cells (LSD test, p = 0.02, Supplementary information, Figure S1E), indicating the reduced acidification caused by c.1516 C>T mutation. Taken together, these results suggest that ATP6V1B2 c.1516 C>T mutation is a haploinsufficient mutation.In summary, we identified a de novo mutation (c.1516 C>T (p.Arg506X)) in ATP6V1B2 as the cause of DDOD syndrome in three independently identified individuals using whole-exome sequencing. Molecular epidemiology analysis showed that the mutation was not present in 1 053 ethnically matched normal hearing controls. We generated a cochlea-specific Atp6v1b2-knockdown mouse model and found that Atp6v1b2 deficiency leads to severe sensorineural hearing loss. In vitro pathogenic evaluation showed that the ATP6V1B2 p.Arg506X is a haploinsufficient mutation and resulted in abnormal acidification in lysosomes. These findings provide the molecular basis for DDOD genetic diagnosis as well as future therapeutic interventions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201477"
"cr","Receptor-mediated mitophagy in yeast and mammalian systems","Mitophagy, or mitochondria autophagy, plays a critical role in selective removal of damaged or unwanted mitochondria. Several protein receptors, including Atg32 in yeast, NIX/BNIP3L, BNIP3 and FUNDC1 in mammalian systems, directly act in mitophagy. Atg32 interacts with Atg8 and Atg11 on the surface of mitochondria, promoting core Atg protein assembly for mitophagy. NIX/BNIP3L, BNIP3 and FUNDC1 also have a classic motif to directly bind LC3 (Atg8 homolog in mammals) for activation of mitophagy. Recent studies have shown that receptor-mediated mitophagy is regulated by reversible protein phosphorylation. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) phosphorylates Atg32 and activates mitophagy in yeast. In contrast, in mammalian cells Src kinase and CK2 phosphorylate FUNDC1 to prevent mitophagy. Notably, in response to hypoxia and FCCP treatment, the mitochondrial phosphatase PGAM5 dephosphorylates FUNDC1 to activate mitophagy. Here, we mainly focus on recent advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the activation of receptor-mediated mitophagy and the implications of this catabolic process in health and disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201475"
"cr","An epigenomic approach to therapy for tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer","Tamoxifen has been a frontline treatment for estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-positive breast tumors in premenopausal women. However, resistance to tamoxifen occurs in many patients. ER still plays a critical role in the growth of breast cancer cells with acquired tamoxifen resistance, suggesting that ERα remains a valid target for treatment of tamoxifen-resistant (Tam-R) breast cancer. In an effort to identify novel regulators of ERα signaling, through a small-scale siRNA screen against histone methyl modifiers, we found WHSC1, a histone H3K36 methyltransferase, as a positive regulator of ERα signaling in breast cancer cells. We demonstrated that WHSC1 is recruited to the ERα gene by the BET protein BRD3/4, and facilitates ERα gene expression. The small-molecule BET protein inhibitor JQ1 potently suppressed the classic ERα signaling pathway and the growth of Tam-R breast cancer cells in culture. Using a Tam-R breast cancer xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated in vivo anti-breast cancer activity by JQ1 and a strong long-lasting effect of combination therapy with JQ1 and the ER degrader fulvestrant. Taken together, we provide evidence that the epigenomic proteins BRD3/4 and WHSC1 are essential regulators of estrogen receptor signaling and are novel therapeutic targets for treatment of Tam-R breast cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201471"
"cr","No receptor stands alone: IgG B-cell receptor intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms contribute to antibody memory","Acquired immunological memory is a striking phenomenon. A lethal epidemic sweeps through a naïve population, many die but those who survive are never “attacked twice ― never at least fatally”, as the historian Thucydides observed in 430 BCE. Antibody memory is critical for protection against many human infectious diseases and is the basis for nearly all current human vaccines. Antibody memory is encoded, in part, in isotype-switched immunoglobulin (Ig)G-expressing memory B cells that are generated in the primary response to antigen and give rise to rapid, high-affinity and high-titered antibody responses upon challenge with the same antigen. How IgG-B-cell receptors (BCRs) and antigen-induced IgG-BCR signaling contribute to memory antibody responses are not fully understood. In this review, we summarize exciting new advances that are revealing the cellular and molecular mechanisms at play in antibody memory and discuss how studies using different experimental approaches will help elucidate the complex phenomenon of B-cell memory.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201465"
"cr","Structure and domain organization of Drosophila Tudor","Drosophila tudor is a maternal effect gene required for germ cell formation and abdominal segmentation during oogenesis1,2. It encodes a large protein, Tudor (Tud), of 2 515 amino acids, containing 11 copies of a ∼60-residue sequence motif, termed the tudor domain. Tudor domains are best characterized by their methyllysine and methylarginine binding abilities3,4,5. Biochemically, Tud interacts with Aubergine (Aub), a Piwi family protein, in a manner dependent on symmetrically dimethylated arginine (sDMA) residues located at the N-terminal end of Aub6,7,8. The sDMA-dependent interaction between Tud and Aub is part of a broad range of phenomena involving tudor domain and Piwi family proteins, in species ranging from fruit flies to mammals3. We and others have shown previously that domains 7-11 of Tud (Tud7-11) were necessary and sufficient for germ cell formation and interaction with arginine-methylated Aub9,10,11. The structure of Tud11 in complex with sDMA-Aub peptides, together with the structure of human SND1 (TDRD11) bound to sDMA peptides from PIWIL1, uncovered the composition of the sDMA-binding pocket, which consists of a cage of four aromatic residues and an asparagine10,12. Interestingly, the sDMA-binding tudor domains are rigidly embedded in a structural module termed the extended Tudor domain (eTud), which comprises an additional juxtaposed OB-fold domain13,14. It is likely that all tudor domains in Tud7-11 have an eTud fold (Supplementary information, Figure S1A)10. However, apart from Tud11, the structures and sDMA binding properties of tudor domains are unknown. More importantly, a mechanistic understanding of Tud's molecular functions in germ plasm requires the knowledge of the spatial organization of the tandem tudor domains as a whole.To learn the overall structure of Tud7-11 and the features of individual structural units, we expressed Tud7-11 (aa 1 617-2 515) in E. coli and probed its domain organization by limited proteolysis. Digestion of Tud7-11 with V8 (Glu-C) protease produced two smaller, stable bands corresponding to Tud9-11 and Tud7-8, as determined by N-terminal sequencing (Figure 1A). However, crystallization attempts of recombinant Tud7-11 and Tud9-11 were unsuccessful despite many efforts. We did crystallize a recombinant Tud10-11 fragment (aa 2 163-2 515) and solved a 3.0 Å structure (see Supplementary information, Table S1). The structure shows that, like Tud11, Tud10 is also embedded in a Tudor-SN/p300-like OB-fold scaffold, forming an eTud unit (Figure 1B). The two eTud modules have a similar overall fold, with a root-mean-squared (r.m.s.) deviation of 1.81 Å. Comparison of the present Tud11 structure with the previously determined peptide-bound Tud11 structure (Tud11-pep) gives rise to an r.m.s. deviation of 1.29 Å (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). The aromatic cage involved in binding sDMA in Tud11 is not conserved in Tud10: Ser2220 and Leu2245 in Tud10 take the place of Phe2403 and Phe2427 in Tud11, respectively (Figure 1C and Supplementary information, Figure S1A). Superposition of the Tud10 and Tud11-pep structures reveals two deleterious effects of Ser2220 for sDMA binding: 1) it lacks cation-π interactions with sDMA; 2) its small size allows Tyr2227 to move closer, making the pseudo sDMA-binding pocket too small to accommodate sDMA (Figure 1C). It appears that Leu2245 is less harmful for sDMA binding, as it can maintain hydrophobic interaction with the methyl group. Consistent with the structural observation, we detected no interaction between recombinant Tud10 and methylated Aub peptides by ITC.Figure 1Structure of Tud7-11. (A) Domain organization of Tud7-11. Top, a schematic diagram showing distribution of eTud modules based on sequence alignment and secondary structure analyses. The domains and their spacing were approximately drawn in scale. Bottom: time course of limited proteolysis with V8 protease generating two stable fragments corresponding to Tud7-8 and Tud9-11.

(E) Comparison of the sDMA-binding pockets of Tud9 and Tud11. The Aub peptide bound to Tud11 is shown in brown, with the sDMA residue shown in a stick model. (F) Experimental SAXS curve from Tud7-11 in solution. Green dots represent the experimental SAXS data points. Blue dashed line represents the scattering curve computed from the ab initio envelope. The inset at left bottom corner shows the distance distribution functions p(r). (G) Molecular envelope of Tud7-11. The ab initio low-resolution SAXS-derived envelope is shown in a sphere representation. The crystal structures of Tud9, Tud10-11, and the simulated models of Tud7 and Tud8, all shown in a ribbon representation, were docked into the envelope as rigid bodies.Full size imageThe Tud10-11 structure revealed for the first time the packing mode of methylarginine-binding tandem eTud domains. In the structure, the two eTud modules are rigidly juxtaposed in a head-to-head manner (Figure 1B). The packing buries a total surface area of 1 007 Å2, which indicates a moderate binding affinity between the two eTud modules. A majority of the sidechain contacts are between residues located in the OB-fold domains, and they are mostly polar interactions. In particular, Glu2305 and Tyr2326 each forms a hydrogen bond with Arg2454, and Arg2323 forms two hydrogen bonds with Asp2369 (Supplementary information, Figure S1C). An E2305R/R2323E/Y2326A triple mutation results in an altered spatial organization between Tud10 and Tud11, as evidenced by the change of sedimentation coefficients in analytic ultracentrifugation experiments (Supplementary information, Figure S1D). These features are consistent with the properties of two independently folded, moderately associated eTud modules that can be separately expressed and purified, even crystallized in the case of Tud1110.We also crystallized and solved a 2.5 Å structure of Tud9 (aa 1 978-2 160), which shows that it also forms an eTud unit (Figure 1D and Supplementary information, Table S1). Superposition of Tud9 with Tud11 of the Tud11-pep complex yielded an r.m.s. deviation of 1.9 Å. Major differences between Tud9 and Tud11 include: 1) the conformation of the loop connecting αA and β3 in the tudor domain; 2) the presence of an additional short helix, αC', in the OB-fold domain of Tud9; and 3) an extended αD in Tud9 (Supplementary information, Figure S1E). Despite these differences, the putative sDMA-binding pocket in Tud9 is relatively well conserved (Figure 1E). One main difference is between Leu2058 of Tud9 and Phe2427 in Tud11. ITC measurements of the binding of the wild-type and the L2058F mutant of Tud9 to sDMA peptides of Aub revealed dissociation constants (Kd) in the sub-millimolar range for both proteins (Supplementary information, Figure S1F). The weak but robust interactions indicate that: 1) the putative sDMA-binding pocket is an authentic one; 2) the insensitivity to the flanking sequences of sDMA peptide suggests that either Tud9 is a promiscuous sDMA binder or that Aub is not its true binding partner; and 3) an aromatic residue at the position occupied by Leu2058 is not necessary for sDMA binding — a hydrophobic residue is most likely sufficient. Both Tud7 and Tud8 have intact sets of sDMA-binding residues, and ITC analyses indicate that Tud7-8 can simultaneously bind two ariginine-methylated Aub peptides with a Kd value of 10 μM (Supplementary information, Figure S1G). In comparison, an isolated Tud8 binds Aub peptides with Kd values ranging from 14 to 32 μM, depending on the location of the sDMA residue within the Aub peptide (Supplementary information, Figure S1G).To obtain an overall understanding of the domain organization in Tud7-11, we performed solution small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments to determine the protein envelope. Ab initio modeling using the SAXS data yielded an L-shaped envelope of Tud7-11 (Figure 1F and 1G). Three lobes of the envelope are clearly visible, one elongated lobe connected via a thin neck to a bilobal, calabash-shaped body. Based on the proteolysis result and the structural information, the globular, calabash-shaped body can be unambiguously assigned to Tud9-11, with Tud9 being the smaller lobe, connected to the larger lobe of Tud10-11 (Figure 1B, 1D and 1G). The size of the elongated lobe is capable of accommodating two eTud modules. Crystallization of Tud7-8 or Tud7 and Tud8 separately was not successful despite many efforts. We then generated the structures of Tud7 and Tud8 by homology modeling using the Tud9 structure as the template. The crystal structures of Tud9, Tud10-11, and the modeled Tud7 and Tud8 structures were then placed into the SAXS-generated envelope using a combined approach of computational docking and manual adjustment (Figure 1G and Supplementary information, Figure S1H). The low-resolution, approximate model of Tud7-11 conforms to the molecular envelopes well, and it can account for known biochemical properties of Tud7-11. The Tud7-11 model structure shows that all sDMA-binding sites are well spaced and accessible, with the sDMA-binding sites of Tud7, Tud9 and Tud11 located on one side of the protein surface (Supplementary information, Figure S1H).The domain organization of Tud7-11 provided first evidence that certain eTud modules may pack into a compact structure. This finding is biologically significant, as the packing creates asymmetry among individual Tud units that may affect their ligand binding properties, as exampled in methyllysine-binding tandem tudor domains. A different domain organization was observed for the four-tudor domain fragment of murine TDRD1, which showed a flexible, extended conformation from a SAXS study15. The extended vs the more compact conformation of the tandem tudor domains would place the binding partners of individual tudor units at different geometric arrangements, constraining the interactions of binding partners with the tudor domain proteins, as well as those between themselves and with downstream targets, hence determining the biological properties of the tudor domain proteins. In Tud7-11, the bulky Tud9-11 is connected to the elongated Tud7-8 via a thin hinge, suggesting that the two structural ensembles have a flexible relative positioning, in agreement with the domain mapping result by proteolysis. The model also indicates that all sDMA-binding sites are accessible, suggesting that Tud7-11 can bind multiple arginine-methylated proteins simultaneously. Our previous study showed that mutations compromising aromatic cages in each of the five tudor domains, except Tud8, resulted in defective germ cell formation10. While it can be argued that ligand binding by Tud8 is not essential for germ cell formation, it is surprising that mutation in Tud10 has a detrimental effect, as its tudor domain does not have a complete set of aromatic residues needed for binding sDMA. In fact, localization of the Tud10 mutant to the germ plasm was unaffected, pointing to the requirement of a separate set of intermolecular interactions involving unmethylated binding partners for its function in germ cell formation. Coincidently, a highly conserved residue, Arg2228, required for stabilizing the putative ligand-binding site in Tud10, is also needed for Tud function in germ cell formation9.In summary, the overall spatial organization of the tandem eTud modules of Tud7-11, together with the knowledge of structures and sDMA binding properties of individual eTud units, provided new mechanistic insights into ligand binding properties of Tud in germ cell formation, and the information should be useful to guide further efforts in identifying new interaction partners and aid the understanding of the assembly of polar granules.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201463"
"cr","Redefining the modular organization of the core Mediator complex","The Mediator complex plays an essential role in the regulation of eukaryotic transcription. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae core Mediator comprises 21 subunits, which are organized into Head, Middle and Tail modules. Previously, the Head module was assigned to a distinct dense domain at the base, and the Middle and Tail modules were identified to form a tight structure above the Head module, which apparently contradicted findings from many biochemical and functional studies. Here, we compared the structures of the core Mediator and its subcomplexes, especially the first 3D structure of the Head + Middle modules, which permitted an unambiguous assignment of the three modules. Furthermore, nanogold labeling pinpointing four Mediator subunits from different modules conclusively validated the modular assignment, in which the Head and Middle modules fold back on one another and form the upper portion of the core Mediator, while the Tail module forms a distinct dense domain at the base. The new modular model of the core Mediator has reconciled the previous inconsistencies between the structurally and functionally defined Mediator modules. Collectively, these analyses completely redefine the modular organization of the core Mediator, which allow us to integrate the structural and functional information into a coherent mechanism for the Mediator's modularity and regulation in transcription initiation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201464"
"cr","Manipulation of a VEGF-Notch signaling circuit drives formation of functional vascular endothelial progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells","Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived endothelial lineage cells constitutes a promising source for therapeutic revascularization, but progress in this arena has been hampered by a lack of clinically-scalable differentiation protocols and inefficient formation of a functional vessel network integrating with the host circulation upon transplantation. Using a human embryonic stem cell reporter cell line, where green fluorescent protein expression is driven by an endothelial cell-specific VE-cadherin (VEC) promoter, we screened for > 60 bioactive small molecules that would promote endothelial differentiation, and found that administration of BMP4 and a GSK-3β inhibitor in an early phase and treatment with VEGF-A and inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway in a later phase led to efficient differentiation of hPSCs to the endothelial lineage within six days. This sequential approach generated > 50% conversion of hPSCs to endothelial cells (ECs), specifically VEC+CD31+CD34+CD14−KDRhigh endothelial progenitors (EPs) that exhibited higher angiogenic and clonogenic proliferation potential among endothelial lineage cells. Pharmaceutical inhibition or genetical knockdown of Notch signaling, in combination with VEGF-A treatment, resulted in efficient formation of EPs via KDR+ mesodermal precursors and blockade of the conversion of EPs to mature ECs. The generated EPs successfully formed functional capillary vessels in vivo with anastomosis to the host vessels when transplanted into immunocompromised mice. Manipulation of this VEGF-A-Notch signaling circuit in our protocol leads to rapid large-scale production of the hPSC-derived EPs by 12- to 20-fold vs current methods, which may serve as an attractive cell population for regenerative vascularization with superior vessel forming capability compared to mature ECs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201459"
"cr","Pachytene piRNAs instruct massive mRNA elimination during late spermiogenesis","Spermatogenesis in mammals is characterized by two waves of piRNA expression: one corresponds to classic piRNAs responsible for silencing retrotransponsons and the second wave is predominantly derived from nontransposon intergenic regions in pachytene spermatocytes, but the function of these pachytene piRNAs is largely unknown. Here, we report the involvement of pachytene piRNAs in instructing massive mRNA elimination in mouse elongating spermatids (ES). We demonstrate that a piRNA-induced silencing complex (pi-RISC) containing murine PIWI (MIWI) and deadenylase CAF1 is selectively assembled in ES, which is responsible for inducing mRNA deadenylation and decay via a mechanism that resembles the action of miRNAs in somatic cells. Such a highly orchestrated program appears to take full advantage of the enormous repertoire of diversified targeting capacity of pachytene piRNAs derived from nontransposon intergenic regions. These findings suggest that pachytene piRNAs are responsible for inactivating vast cellular programs in preparation for sperm production from ES.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201441"
"cr","Structural insights into the TRIM family of ubiquitin E3 ligases","TRIM proteins play important roles in a wide range of biological processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, development, apoptosis, oncogenesis and innate immunity1,2. The N-terminal regions of all TRIM proteins contain a RING finger domain followed by one or two B-box domains and a coiled-coil domain (CCD). The RING-finger domain comprises conserved cysteine and histidine residues that bind two zinc atoms in a 'cross-brace' arrangement, and is essential for recruiting the ubiquitin-charged ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2∼Ub). The B-box domains, differing in both the number and spacing of the conserved cysteine and histidine residues3, are typically composed of B1 and B2 domains, but some TRIM members only contain a B2 domain. CCD following the B-box domains has been proposed to mediate protein-protein interactions, particularly homomeric and heteromeric interactions by forming intertwining helices among TRIM family and other proteins4,5.Unlike some ubiquitin ligases that form multi-subunit complexes and catalyze ubiquitination with the help of other subunits6, TRIM proteins can exert their ubiquitin ligase activity as single-component ubiqutin ligases7,8. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. To understand how the highly conserved CCDs contribute to TRIM-catalyzed unbiquitination, we determined a crystal structure of the CCD (residues 143 to 321) of human TRIM69 at 2.15 Å resolution (Figure 1A, 1B and Supplementary information, Figure S1). The structure reveals that TRIM69 CCD forms a homodimer in an anti-parallel orientation (Figure 1B). Each monomer contains three α-helices (α1-α3). The N-terminal 112 residues (152 to 263) form the α1 helix with the length of about 168 Å. The α2 helix containing residues 266 to 288 folds back to form a 3-helix bundle with the two α1 helices of the dimer (Figure 1B and 1C). The short α3 helix (residues 305 to 318) is almost perpendicular to the long axis of the two long α1 helices (Figure 1C and Supplementary information, Figure S2A). In TRIM69, a conserved PRY/SPRY domain (also known as B30.2 domain) follows the CCD. Structural comparison of homologous PRY/SPRY domains in different species reveals that they share a highly similar fold (backbone rmsd of 0.65–1.25 Å), despite their low sequence identity (ranging from 15.7% to 24.7%) (Supplementary information, Figure S2B and S2C). Interestingly, most of them contain a short α-helix at their N-termini (Supplementary information, Figure S2B), which appears equivalent to the α3 helix in our CCD structure. Indeed, structural modeling shows that the configuration of α3 allows the PRY/SPRY domain to protrude from the rod-like coiled coil without steric clashing (Figure 1B, 1C and Supplementary information, Figure S2A).Figure 1TRIM proteins form an anti-parallel dimer. (A) A schematic view of the TRIM69 domain organization. The residue numbers are indicated above. (B) An overall structure of the TRIM69 CCD dimer. The N- and C-termini are shown.

(G) The conserved Glu residues mimic the pTyr363 of CBL-B. The model of the TRIM25 RING domain is superimposed to the RING domain of CBL-B. The domains of CBL-B-UbcH5B-Ub are shown. The two conserved Glu residues of TRIM25 are shown in yellow and the pTyr363 of CBL-B is shown in magenta. (H) The acidic motif is required for ubiquitination activity in vitro. Both Glu9 and Glu10 residues were mutated to Ala or Arg. (I) TRIM proteins that contain a conserved acidic motif before the RING domain. The subfamilies of the TRIM proteins are indicated. Proteins known to be involved in antiviral defenses are colored in slate.Full size imageThe dimerization interface between the two monomers is mainly hydrophobic (Supplementary information, Figure S3). A set of hydrophobic residues at this interface are highly conserved among TRIM proteins (Figure 1C and Supplementary information, Figure S4), suggesting that homo- or hetero-dimerization is a conserved mechanism among the TRIM proteins. Further supporting this notion, crosslinking studies showed that purified recombinant TRIM proteins formed dimers as well as higher oligomers (Supplementary information, Figure S5).TRIM25 (Supplementary information, Figure S6A) has well-defined physiological substrates. Both TRIM25 and TRIM69 belong to subfamily IV1, and their expression is up-regulated by many cytokines9. Previous studies have established that TRIM25 ubiquitinates the Caspase Activation and Recruitment Domains (CARDs) of RIG-I7. Recombinant full-length (FL) TRIM25 protein was eluted with an apparent molecular weight of about 300 kD on a gel-filtration column (Supplementary information, Figure S6B), which is larger than the predicted dimer. However, static light scattering result showed that dimers existed in solution (Supplementary information, Figure S6C). The larger apparent molecular weight of TRIM25 in gel filtration is likely due to an elongated shape of the protein molecule. The 2D classification of raw negative staining electron microscopy (EM) particles of the FL TRIM25 protein confirmed that TRIM25 forms anti-parallel dimers. The TRIM25 protein forms an elongated shape, similar to TRIM69, and the RBDs (RING and B-box domains) that presumably locate at the ends have different conformations in some particles probably due to their flexibility (Supplementary information, Figure S6D). As shown in the co-immuoprecipitation (co-IP) assays, differently tagged TRIM25 proteins interacted with each other, which is mediated by their CCDs, further supporting the idea that TRIM25 forms dimer (Supplementary information, Figure S6E). Inferring from the structure of TRIM69 CCD, we propose that TRIM25 might also dimerize through its CCD in vivo; each end of the dimer contains one RBD, and the two PRY/SPRY domains might locate at the midpoint as those in TRIM69 (Supplementary information, Figures S1 and S4).Previous studies suggest that TRIM proteins might form a parallel dimer with the RING domains functioning as one catalytic unit based on spatial approaching10. Our structure, however, suggests that the two RING domains in a TRIM dimer are separated by the long CCD, with a distance of about 170 Å. To find out how the two spatially separated RING domains work together to catalyze ubiquitination, we constructed a set of TRIM25 dimers with different combinations of wild-type and truncated monomers (Figure 1D and Supplementary information, Figure S7). Consistent with the previous report7, FL TRIM25 homodimer ubiquitinated the CARDs of RIG-I. The FL-ΔRBD and FL-RBCC complexes had impaired activity. FL-CCD dimer had very low activity. RBCC and ΔRBD proteins had no detectable activity (Figure 1E). Furthermore, co-IP results indicate that the PRY/SPRY domain of TRIM25 is required for substrate recruitment (Supplementary information, Figure S8). Consistently, the FL-RBCC dimer exhibited a lower activity than the FL homodimer, whereas the RBCC dimer had no detectable activity. The in vivo ubiquitination results were consistent with the in vitro observations (Figure 1F). Interestingly, the SCFCdc4 ubiquitin ligase complex also forms a superhelical homotypic dimer through Cdc4 proteins, and similarly each protein at both ends with a distance of about 160 Å is required for unbiquitination11. It might be a common feature of E3 ligases that the two reactive centers at each end of an antiparallel dimer work co-operatively.Comparison of the ubiquitination activities of TRIM25 dimers of various combinations has three implications. First, a single RBD at one end of a dimer could function individually. Second, the RBD at one side could ubiquitinate the substrate bound to both PRY/SPRY domains, but ubiquitinates the substrate bound to the proximal PRY/SPRY domain more efficiently. Third, each PRY/SPRY domain could bind substrate individually. The time course assay showed that TRIM25 dimers with two RBDs were much more efficient in catalyzing ubiquitination as compared to the dimers with a single RBD (Supplementary information, Figure S9A and S9B). The activity of the FL homodimer was not inhibited by adding ΔRBD proteins indicating that this dimer did not dissociate or exchange with free monomers (Supplementary information, Figure S9C–S9F). Together, these results suggest that two RBDs in a FL-TRIM25 dimer could work cooperatively to ubiquitinate CARDs (2CARD), consistent with previous studies suggesting an allosteric mechanism of ubiquitin transfer by RING domain-containing ubiquitin E3 ligase proteins12.To understand how a single RBD could exert ubiquitin ligase activity, we further truncated TRIM25 RING, B1, B2 or both B domains. The in vivo results showed that both B1 and B2 were required for efficient substrate ubiquitination (Supplementary information, Figure S10). A recent study of CBL-B revealed that a phosphorylated tyrosine-containing element enhances its catalytic efficiency by about 200-fold13. A structure model of TRIM25 RING domain was built based on the structure of RNF168 (PDB: 3L11), which shares 43% sequence identity with TRIM25. Interestingly, two highly conserved glutamates (Glu9 and Glu10) in TRIM25 were located in a site equivalent to the phospho-tyrosine in CBL-B (Figure 1G), raising the possibility that the two Glu residues might play a similar role as the phospho-tyrosine of CBL-B in promoting the ubiquitination activity of TRIM25. Consistent with the structure-based prediction, in vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays suggest that these acidic residues are required for the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM25 (Figure 1H and Supplementary information, Figure S11). Sequence alignment indicates that about 40 TRIMs have an acidic motif containing one or two conserved Glu residues immediately ahead of the RING domain (Figure 1I). Among them, 26 are involved in the innate immune responses (Figure 1I) and contain the PRY/SPRY domain9,14. Whether this conserved acidic motif is required for catalytic activity of other TRIMs needs further investigation.In conclusion, our results show that TRIM proteins form anti-parallel dimers with two spatially separated RING domains acting cooperatively to ubiquitinate substrates. Our study also identified a conserved acidic motif of TRIM proteins that might regulate the enzymatic activity. The rigidly conserved combination, pattern, and order of the tripartite domains among TRIM proteins suggest that the model described here is likely applicable to other TRIM members. It would be interesting to test in future studies whether a similar mechanism is shared by other members of this fascinating family of E3 ligases, and to explore the differences that enable TRIM proteins to perform diverse functions. Of note is that during preparation of our manuscript, a similar conclusion was made based on the crystal structure of the anti-parallel dimer of TRIM25-CCD15.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201446"
"cr","Double-stranded DNA in exosomes: a novel biomarker in cancer detection","Exosomes, small membrane vesicles (30-100 nm) of endocytic origin secreted by most cell types, contain functional biomolecules, which can be horizontally transferred to recipient cells1. Exosomes bear a specific protein and lipid composition, and carry a select set of functional mRNAs and microRNAs2. Recently, our group has shown that c-Met shed in exosomes can promote a proangiogenic and prometastatic phenotype in bone marrow-derived progenitor cells during melanoma progression3. In previous research, retrotransposon RNA transcripts, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), mitochondrial DNA, and oncogene amplifications (i.e., c-myc) have been detected in microvesicles4,5,6. In this report, we provide evidence that tumor-derived exosomes carry double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), as demonstrated through two different approaches, using enzymatic methods (dsDNA-specific shrimp DNase) and physical/structural studies (atomic force microscopy, AFM). Furthermore, we show that exosomal DNA (exoDNA) represents the entire genome and reflects the mutational status of parental tumor cells. We also highlight the translational value of exoDNA in tumor-derived exosomes for its potential usefulness as a circulating biomarker in the early detection of cancer and metastasis.We demonstrate for the first time that the majority of DNA associated with tumor exosomes is double-stranded (Figure 1A-1E). Two types of DNA-specific detection assays were utilized to assess the nature and amount of DNA in three different cancer models including human chronic myeloid leukemia (K-562), human colorectal carcinoma (HCT116), and murine melanoma (B16-F10). One assay is based on the detection of DNA on agarose gels using highly sensitive SYBR Gold nucleic acid staining. The second assay is the QuantiFluor dsDNA Detection System, which uses fluorescent dye that binds specifically to dsDNA (Supplementary information, Data S1). For both assays, we utilized DNases that specifically recognize and digest ssDNA (S1 nuclease) or dsDNA (Shrimp dsDNase). We first verified the specificity of S1 nuclease and dsDNase using purified ssDNA oligonucleotides and Lambda dsDNA as substrates (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). Slight non-specificity of S1 nuclease towards dsDNA was observed. First, to analyze whether DNA is associated with the outer membrane and/or inside exosomes, we extracted DNA from either intact exosomes or exosomes pre-treated with DNases. Remarkably, we observed no change in the pattern of DNA isolated from samples pre-treated with S1 nuclease versus untreated samples (Figure 1A, lane 2 vs lane 5), whereas exosomes pre-treated with dsDNase showed a strong reduction in DNA species greater than 2.5 kb in size and an enrichment of DNA between 100 bp and 2.5 kb (Figure 1A, lane 2 vs lane 8). This indicates that the majority of external exoDNA is dsDNA with a larger size (> 2.5 kb) in comparison to internal exoDNA. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was used as a control for DNase digestion (Figure 1A, lanes 11-13).Figure 1Identification and characterization of exoDNA and its potential use as a diagnostic tool. (A) Equal amounts of DNA extracted from K-562 exosomes, which were untreated (Set a), pre-treated with S1 nuclease (Set b) or dsDNase (Set c), were digested with either S1 nuclease (lanes 3, 6 and 9) or dsDNase (lanes 4, 7 and 10). Digestion of gDNA (Set d) with S1 nuclease (lane 12) or dsDNase (lane 13) serves as controls. (B, C) Analysis of internal exoDNA isolated from HCT116 (B) and B16-F10 (C) after removal of external exoDNA as in A. The results are representative of 2-3 experiments performed independently. (D) AFM image of exoDNA. ExoDNA was extracted from K-562 cells and absorbed on a mica surface in the presence of 5 mM Mg2+. Scale bar, 500 nm. (E) Internal exoDNA was extracted from exosomes secreted by different types of cancer cell lines, including melanoma (B16-F10), pancreatic cancer (Pan02, Pan02 H3, PANC-1, AsPC-1, BXPC-3 and HPAF-II), breast cancer (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-4175), lung cancer (H1650 and H1975), and leukemia (NB-4), and digested with dsDNase. Abundance of dsDNA inside the exosomes, before and after digestion with dsDNase, was expressed as “nanogram of DNA per microgram of exo-Protein”. (F) Circular view of the readings of fragments along each chromosome in the whole-genome sequencing analysis of exoDNA isolated from murine melanoma B16-F10 cell-derived exosomes. (G) ExoDNA represents gDNA shown by comparative genomic hybridization array analysis of B16-F10 exoDNA vs gDNA. (H-J) Mutational analysis of exoDNA. BRAF(V600E) mutation in exoDNA isolated from either cultured melanoma cell lines (H) or circulating exoDNA isolated from SK-MEL-28 melanoma-bearing mice (J) was detected by AS-PCR analysis. gDNA isolated from SK-MEL-28 and SK-MEL-103 cells serves as a positive and negative control, respectively, for V600E mutation (WT (V) and mutant (E) alleles). Arrow indicates the size of expected PCR products. AS-PCR analysis of EGFR mutations in exoDNA isolated from NSCLC cells was shown in I. For del19, “I” indicates internal control; “W”, WT; and “del”, deletion of exon 19. For T790M mutation, “T” indicates WT allele and “M” indicates the mutant allele. The arrow marks the expected size of PCR products.Full size imageTo further characterize internal exoDNA, first we eradicated external DNA using dsDNase digestion. Then, isolated internal exoDNA was analyzed using both the S1 nuclease/dsDNase digestion method and the QuantiFluor assay. We observed that S1 nuclease digestion resulted in a reduction of DNA to a much lesser extent than dsDNase digestion (Figure 1A, lane 9 vs lane 10 and Figure 1B-1C). The same pattern was observed in internal exoDNA isolated from exosomes untreated or pre-treated with S1 nuclease (Figure 1A, lane 3 vs lane 4 and lane 6 vs lane 7). Consistently, we observed a strong reduction in the binding of dsDNA-specific fluorescent DNA-binding dye in the dsDNase-treated exoDNA samples, compared to those undigested or treated with S1 nuclease (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). Taken together, these results suggest that dsDNA predominates in internal exoDNA. On the other hand, a previous report has demonstrated that tumor microvesicles carry ssDNA4. These conflicting observations suggest that exosomes and microvesicles may vary in DNA cargo composition. However, since both approaches were performed in different biological models, future analyses are required to understand the biological relevance of single-stranded vs double-stranded exoDNA. Using AFM, we further confirmed the presence of dsDNA in exosomes (Figure 1D). The height of the exoDNA was ∼700 pm (Supplementary information, Figure S2), comparable to linear control dsDNA of varying sizes and in line with published values7. Although two other previous studies reported the presence of exoDNA, the conclusions of both studies were based on enzymatic methods that employed digestion of external DNA associated with the surface of exosomes using DNase I, an endonuclease that non-specifically digests both ssDNA and dsDNA6,8. Furthermore, each of these groups used a single enzyme approach employing S1 nuclease to demonstrate the presence of ssDNA6 and DNase I digestion to argue for the presence of dsDNA8 within the exosomes. However, given the lack of specificity for dsDNA of DNase I, our study is the first one to definitively demonstrate the presence of dsDNA in exosomes. We performed a comprehensive analysis of external and internal exoDNA using enzymatic methods specific for dsDNA, and physical studies by imaging exoDNA using AFM.To further determine whether the association of DNA with exosomes is a common feature of cancer cells, we extended our analysis to a broader panel of cancer cell lines, including melanoma, and breast, lung, prostate and pancreatic cancers. Indeed, we detected exoDNA in all exosomes examined (Supplementary information, Figure S3). We explored the abundance of exoDNA derived from two normal stromal fibroblast lines, namely human dermal and mammary tissue-derived fibroblasts (DF and O97). We found that the amount of fibroblast exoDNA was about 20-fold less than the amount of exoDNA isolated from tumor cells (Supplementary information, Figure S3). Whether this difference is related to the aberrant, rapid replication of tumor cells needs to be further investigated.Next, we characterized exoDNA by QuantiFluor assay after the eradication of external exoDNA by dsDNase digestion. We showed that dsDNA is a predominant form of internal exoDNA (> 50% reduction in DNA level post dsDNase digestion) in the majority of cell lines (melanoma, leukemia, lung and breast cancers) that we examined (Figure 1E). Notably, exosomes of most pancreatic and lung cancer cell lines studied contained lower amounts of DNA, suggesting differences in exoDNA packaging among different cancer models.We further employed electron microscopy (EM) to visualize the presence of DNA in exosomes. Exosomes derived from murine B16-F10 melanoma were subjected to staining with anti-DNA antibody followed by gold-conjugated secondary antibody and EM analysis. Interestingly, this study revealed that only a subset of exosomes contained DNA (∼10%; Supplementary information, Figure S4). Our study elicits important questions pertaining to the underlying mechanisms of DNA packaging into exosomes. For example, is this phenomenon due to random selection and limiting capacity inside the exosomes or does it reflect differences in the biogenesis of varying subsets within the heterogeneous populations of exosomes, such as their cellular compartment of origin? Similarly, questions relevant to the shedding of genetic material via exosomes and its consequences within the tumor microenvironment also arise from our work.Next, using B16-F10 exosomes as a model system, we performed high throughput whole-genome sequencing (Figure 1F) and comparative genomic hybridization analysis (Figure 1G) to further characterize exoDNA. Importantly, our results revealed the entire genome coverage of exoDNA in an unbiased manner. That is, no bias for gene-coding versus intergenic regions and sense versus antisense strands of gene-coding regions were observed in exoDNA. In addition, no specific fragments were highly enriched or depleted in the exoDNA pool compared to the gDNA. However, we did not detect mitochondrial DNA in exoDNA. Interestingly, mitochondrial DNA has been reported in astrocytes and glioblastoma-derived microvesicles5. Again, this inconsistency could be due to differences between cell types and/or composition of membrane vesicles under study. 5′-cytosine methylation is a major modification of nuclear DNA involved in various biological processes, such as transcription and DNA repair. Therefore, we examined the overall level of 5′-cytosine methylation of exoDNA and found that exoDNA is also methylated to a similar level to gDNA (Supplementary information, Figure S5).Our data prompted us to examine whether exoDNA could be utilized as a surrogate for tumor tissues or cells to detect tumor-specific genetic mutations as recently suggested for other sources of circulating DNA such as cell-free DNA9. To this end, we tested exoDNA isolated from various cancer cell lines for driver mutations known to be present in those cell lines (Figure 1H and 1I). One example is the BRAF(V600E) mutation, present in ∼50% of malignant melanomas10. We performed allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR)11 analysis to evaluate the mutational status of BRAF in exoDNA isolated from several human primary melanoma cell lines, which harbor either wild-type (WT; SK-MEL-146 and SK-MEL-147) or mutated BRAF (SK-MEL-28, SK-MEL-133, SK-MEL-192, and SK-MEL-267). The sensitivity and specificity of the AS-PCR assay was assessed (Supplementary information, Figure S6). By using primers that distinguished WT (“V”) from mutant alleles (“E”) of BRAF, we detected the mutant alleles in exoDNA of all cell lines containing the mutation, whereas only the WT allele was detected in those cell lines with non-mutated BRAF (Figure 1H). A second example of a well-described tumor-associated mutation is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is mutated in several types of cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)12,13. EGFR mutational status is crucial for selecting patients who will benefit from targeted therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors12,13. We employed AS-PCR to assess EGFR mutation in exoDNA from several NSCLC cell lines14,15, including H292 (WT), H1975 (harboring the L858R and T790M gate-keeper mutations), and H1650 and PC-9 (harboring the exon 19 deletion ― del19). As shown in Figure 1I, we detected respective EGFR mutations in 100% of exoDNA isolated from these cell lines. Our findings demonstrate that exoDNA reflects the mutational status of the parental cell lines.To assess the feasibility of detecting tumor-associated genetic mutations in circulating exoDNA, we employed a pre-clinical animal model of melanoma (SK-MEL-28) harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Cells were subcutaneously implanted in the flank of NOD/SCID mice. Plasma was harvested when the tumor reached the maximum size allowed and circulating exosomes were isolated. ExoDNA was analyzed for the BRAF(V600E) mutation using AS-PCR as described above. We were able to readily detect the V600E mutation in the circulating exoDNA isolated from melanoma-bearing mice (Figure 1J).In conclusion, we show for the first time the presence of dsDNA in exosomes representing the whole genomic DNA. Our finding that exoDNA can be used to identify mutations present in parental tumor cells illustrates its significant translational potential as a circulating biomarker for cancer in the clinic. ExoDNA is an attractive, potential biomarker candidate in the early detection of cancers and the monitoring of treatment response for several reasons: its protection and thus inherent stability within exosomes; the possibility to isolate or enrich tumor-derived exosomes in complex plasma samples via exosomal surface markers; and its easy and fast preparation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201444"
"cr","Ago2 facilitates Rad51 recruitment and DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination","DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly cytotoxic lesions and pose a major threat to genome stability if not properly repaired. We and others have previously shown that a class of DSB-induced small RNAs (diRNAs) is produced from sequences around DSB sites. DiRNAs are associated with Argonaute (Ago) proteins and play an important role in DSB repair, though the mechanism through which they act remains unclear. Here, we report that the role of diRNAs in DSB repair is restricted to repair by homologous recombination (HR) and that it specifically relies on the effector protein Ago2 in mammalian cells. Interestingly, we show that Ago2 forms a complex with Rad51 and that the interaction is enhanced in cells treated with ionizing radiation. We demonstrate that Rad51 accumulation at DSB sites and HR repair depend on catalytic activity and small RNA-binding capability of Ago2. In contrast, DSB resection as well as RPA and Mre11 loading is unaffected by Ago2 or Dicer depletion, suggesting that Ago2 very likely functions directly in mediating Rad51 accumulation at DSBs. Taken together, our findings suggest that guided by diRNAs, Ago2 can promote Rad51 recruitment and/or retention at DSBs to facilitate repair by HR.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201436"
"cr","Human colorectal cancer-specific CCAT1-L lncRNA regulates long-range chromatin interactions at the MYC locus","The human 8q24 gene desert contains multiple enhancers that form tissue-specific long-range chromatin loops with the MYC oncogene, but how chromatin looping at the MYC locus is regulated remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), CCAT1-L, is transcribed specifically in human colorectal cancers from a locus 515 kb upstream of MYC. This lncRNA plays a role in MYC transcriptional regulation and promotes long-range chromatin looping. Importantly, the CCAT1-L locus is located within a strong super-enhancer and is spatially close to MYC. Knockdown of CCAT1-L reduced long-range interactions between the MYC promoter and its enhancers. In addition, CCAT1-L interacts with CTCF and modulates chromatin conformation at these loop regions. These results reveal an important role of a previously unannotated lncRNA in gene regulation at the MYC locus.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201435"
"cr","Generation of neural progenitor cells by chemical cocktails and hypoxia","Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) can be induced from somatic cells by defined factors. Here we report that NPCs can be generated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts by a chemical cocktail, namely VCR (V, VPA, an inhibitor of HDACs; C, CHIR99021, an inhibitor of GSK-3 kinases and R, Repsox, an inhibitor of TGF-β pathways), under a physiological hypoxic condition. These chemical-induced NPCs (ciNPCs) resemble mouse brain-derived NPCs regarding their proliferative and self-renewing abilities, gene expression profiles, and multipotency for different neuroectodermal lineages in vitro and in vivo. Further experiments reveal that alternative cocktails with inhibitors of histone deacetylation, glycogen synthase kinase, and TGF-β pathways show similar efficacies for ciNPC induction. Moreover, ciNPCs can also be induced from mouse tail-tip fibroblasts and human urinary cells with the same chemical cocktail VCR. Thus our study demonstrates that lineage-specific conversion of somatic cells to NPCs could be achieved by chemical cocktails without introducing exogenous factors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201432"
"cr","Anp32e, a higher eukaryotic histone chaperone directs preferential recognition for H2A.Z","H2A.Z is a highly conserved histone variant in all species. The chromatin deposition of H2A.Z is specifically catalyzed by the yeast chromatin remodeling complex SWR1 and its mammalian counterpart SRCAP. However, the mechanism by which H2A.Z is preferentially recognized by non-histone proteins remains elusive. Here we identified Anp32e, a novel higher eukaryote-specific histone chaperone for H2A.Z. Anp32e preferentially associates with H2A.Z-H2B dimers rather than H2A-H2B dimers in vitro and in vivo and dissociates non-nucleosomal aggregates formed by DNA and H2A-H2B. We determined the crystal structure of the Anp32e chaperone domain (186-232) in complex with the H2A.Z-H2B dimer. In this structure, the region containing Anp32e residues 214-224, which is absent in other Anp32 family proteins, specifically interacts with the extended H2A.Z αC helix, which exhibits an unexpected conformational change. Genome-wide profiling of Anp32e revealed a remarkable co-occupancy between Anp32e and H2A.Z. Cells overexpressing Anp32e displayed a strong global H2A.Z loss at the +1 nucleosomes, whereas cells depleted of Anp32e displayed a moderate global H2A.Z increase at the +1 nucleosomes. This suggests that Anp32e may help to resolve the non-nucleosomal H2A.Z aggregates and also facilitate the removal of H2A.Z at the +1 nucleosomes, and the latter may help RNA polymerase II to pass the first nucleosomal barrier.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201430"
"cr","Complete decoding of TAL effectors for DNA recognition","The most striking feature of a transcription activator-like effector (TALE) is the presence of a central DNA-binding region composed of tandem repeats of about 34 amino acids1. Two hypervariable residues at positions 12 and 13 (repeat-variable diresidues or RVDs) in each repeat bind to DNA, and this modular DNA-binding feature of TALE repeats has inspired the development of custom-designed TALE repeats for gene editing2,3,4,5. The nucleotide recognition preference of the commonly used RVDs has been experimentally or computationally determined2,5. For instance, RVD NN has a high preference for both G and A. The rare RVDs, NK and NH, have better specificity for guanine than NN, but their affinity is relatively lower3,6,7. We thus decided to conduct a thorough investigation of potential RVDs, which cover all possible combinations of amino acid diresidues, for their DNA recognition capabilities.We set up a screening platform composed of an artificial TALE-VP64-mCherry construct, which expresses RVD (XX') in 3-tandem repeat format (from 7th to 9th, TALE-(XX')3), and 4 corresponding EGFP reporter constructs, in which potential TALE-(XX')3-binding sites composed of 3 consecutive nucleotides (A, T, C or G) are located in front of a minCMV promoter and its downstream EGFP gene (Figure 1A, Supplementary information, Figure S1A and Data S1). To test this system, we made a control TALE (TALE-Ctrl) that is identical to TALE-(XX')3 except for the repeat domain (Supplementary information, Figure S1A), and confirmed that it could not activate any of the 4 EGFP reporters (Supplementary information, Figure S1B), thus serving as the control for basal activity. We then constructed 4 TALE-(XX')3 expression plasmids by placing the common RVDs (NI, NG, HD and NN) in the middle to target the 3A, 3T, 3C and 3G EGFP reporters, respectively (Supplementary information, Figure S1C). These TALE-(XX')3 constructs were individually introduced into HEK293T cells together with 1 of the 4 EGFP reporter plasmids to examine their specificities, which were determined by the fold induction of EGFP expression compared with the basal level (Supplementary information, Data S1). The identity of XX' determined TALE-(XX')3 specificity on different EGFP reporters: NI, NG, HD and NN predominantly recognized A, T, C and G or A, respectively. This result is consistent with the current knowledge regarding the base preference of these 4 common RVDs, demonstrating that this artificial system is suitable for testing the DNA recognition ability of RVDs (Supplementary information, Figure S1D-S1E).Figure 1A Complete assessment of TALE RVD efficiencies and specificities. (A) Design of the screening system for novel TALE RVDs. (B) A heat map generated from library screening of TALE-(XX')3 with four reporters (3A, 3T, 3C, and 3G) reflecting the base preference of 400 RVDs. EGFP activities from different reporters were coded by different colors representing the reporter identities (3A, green; 3T, red; 3C, blue; 3G, yellow), and the brightness of the colors indicates the fold induction of reporters by TALE-(XX')3 compared to the basal levels. The single-letter abbreviations for the amino acids are used. (C) Design of TALE-(XX')6 and its corresponding reporters. (D) Design of TALE-(XX')12 and its corresponding reporters. (E-F) Base preference of RVDs in TALE-(XX')6 (E) and TALE-(XX')12 (F). RVDs were clustered by base preference. The x-axis labels indicate the variable RVDs tested in TALE-(XX')6 or TALE-(XX')12. Data are means ± SD, n = 3; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, and ***P < 0.005.Full size imageTo quantitatively measure the base preference of all theoretical RVDs, we created a library of TALE-(XX')3 constructs, which covers a total of 400 types of RVDs, following a special protocol combined with the ULtiMATE assembly method8 (Supplementary information, Figure S2 and Data S1). X and X' correspond to the 12th and 13th amino acids in a classical TALE module, respectively. We introduced each of the 400 TALE-(XX')3 constructs (Supplementary information, Tables S1 and S2) individually into HEK293T cells together with 1 of the 4 EGFP reporter plasmids and measured both the EGFP and mCherry levels by FACS analysis. We then determined the base-recognition efficiencies of the 400 diresidues. A total of 1 600 data points were summarized in 3 formats: heat map (Figure 1B), histograms categorized by the 13th residue (X') (Supplementary information, Figure S3) and the 12th residue (X) (Supplementary information, Figure S4). The results obtained from this screening provide substantial information regarding the base preference of all theoretical RVDs. In addition to NI, NG, HD and NN, all the natural RVDs and a few artificial RVDs showed base-recognition preferences that were similar to those reported previously2,5,6,7 (Supplementary information, Table S3). Besides these 25 RVDs, we determined the DNA base-recognition preference of the remaining 375 RVDs that did not evolve naturally and have not been previously examined.Notably, many of these artificial RVDs showed a distinct preference for DNA bases compared with the 25 reported RVDs, and only a few of them start with 1 of the 2 frequently occurring amino acids, Asn and His (Figure 1B, Supplementary information, Figures S3 and S4). From these artificial RVDs, we selected those that showed potential base-recognition preference based on the criteria shown in Supplementary information, Data S1 for further intensive analyses. We found that the adenine recognition ability of KI and RI was similar to that of NI (Supplementary information, Figure S5A). For thymine recognition, we identified 3 additional RVDs aside from NG, which all end with Gly (RG, KG and HG), and seven RVDs that all end with Ala (KA, CA, FA, YA, RA, PA, and AA), but appeared to have higher background, especially for C recognition (Supplementary information, Figure S5B). HD and ND, as reported previously2,5,7, were optimal RVDs for C recognition, with almost no non-specific recognition of other bases (Supplementary information, Figure S5C). Five groups of RVDs were identified to recognize guanine, with each group sharing the same 13th residue: Asn (N), His (H), Arg (R), Gln (Q), or Lys (K). Most of these RVDs predominantly recognized guanine except for HN and NN (Supplementary information, Figure S5D). These data support the prediction from previous TALE structural studies suggesting that the 13th residues of TALE repeats make the base-specific contact9,10. Nevertheless, our data indicate that the 12th residue also affects RVD specificity. For example, with the same N13, KN and RN only recognized G, whereas HN and NN recognized both A and G, and LN and MN preferred T and C. Similarly, HQ, KQ and RQ preferentially recognized G, whereas LQ preferred T (Supplementary information, Figures S3-S6).To further examine the base-recognition preference of RVDs, we created two additional artificial platforms with increased stringency, in which multiple TALE repeats carrying the same RVDs were aligned in tandem: TALE-(XX')6 and its corresponding EGFP reporter constructs (6A, 6T, 6C, and 6G) (Figure 1C) were used to test RVDs in 6-tandem repeat format, and TALE-(XX')12 and its corresponding EGFP reporter constructs (12A, 12T, 12C, and 12G) (Figure 1D) were used to test RVDs in 12-tandem repeat format (Supplementary information, Table S1 and Figure S2). In addition to the 4 most common RVDs, which were used as controls, we mainly chose those that demonstrated outstanding base-recognition specificities from the initial screening. We found that KI and NI functioned similarly with respect to A recognition in the 6-repeat format (Figure 1E). The activities of TALE-(RG)6 and TALE-(HG)6 were similar to TALE-(NG)6 for 6T recognition (Figure 1E), whereas TALE-(KG)6 showed reduced specificity for 6T (Supplementary information, Figure S7). HD and ND again demonstrated strong C preference (Figure 1E). KN, RN, NH and HH showed specific G recognition with variable efficiencies in 6-tandem repeats, whereas NN and HN recognized both G and A as in the 3-repeat format (Figure 1E), and the 6G preference of TALE-(XX')6 containing either NR, FR, KH, NK, FK or RQ was significantly reduced (Supplementary information, Figure S7). Interestingly, only TALE-(XX')12 with RG (for T), HD (for C), NN (for G) and KN (for G) in 12-tandem repeats maintained recognition efficiency and specificity (Figure 1F). This result is somewhat surprising for RG as it is assumed that RVDs ending with Gly cannot form hydrogen bonds with thymine10. Consistent with previous reports6,7, neither TALE-(NH)12 nor TALE-(HH)12 could support 12G reporter activation. Considering the strong preference of NH for G in the 6-repeat format, it is unclear why TALE-(KN)12 but not TALE-(NH)12 retained activity for the 12G reporter. By the same token, it is also unclear why TALE-(ND)12 completely lost its preference for the 12C reporter (Figure 1F). Although the combination of the 12th and 13th amino acids determines the ultimate binding activity of TALE, the increase of repeat number also leads to the decrease or even complete loss of DNA-recognition activity of TALE, which is likely due to either steric or static repulsion between consecutive TALE repeat units.To further evaluate these novel RVDs, we applied KN and RG in TALEN assembly in place of NN and NG, respectively, and compared them with conventional RVDs in TALENs-mediated DNA cleavage by measuring indel rates. TALENsKN for G-targeting showed similar efficiency in creating indels as TALENsNN in 2 independent tests, and both of them performed better than TALENsNH. On the contrary, TALENsRG, although functional, were less effective than TALENsNG (Supplementary information, Table S4). It is possible that other diresidues newly revealed in this study could function as valid RVDs in recognizing DNA bases with high specificity. However, rigorous tests are needed in order to more accurately determine their DNA recognition capabilities.In addition, we identified a significant number of RVDs that target multiple DNA bases (Supplementary information, Table S5). The availability of RVDs that target different combinations of bases in a degenerate manner may provide certain flexibility in future application such as engineering of sophisticated genetic circuitry11.By further deciphering the DNA base preference of all RVDs, natural or artificial, we can achieve a clear understanding of the mechanism that guides the base preference of TALE RVDs. Comprehensive information regarding the specific DNA associations of all RVDs may improve the application of TAL effectors in bioengineering and precision therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201419"
"cr","Crystal structure and biochemical analysis of the heptameric Lsm1-7 complex","The Lsm (Sm-like) family of proteins, characterized by the Sm fold1 and conserved among eukaryotes, plays an important role in RNA biogenesis. The Sm and Lsm complexes play an essential role in pre-mRNA splicing2. Of the five small ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), four (U1, U2, U4, U5) contain the Sm heptamer ring, whereas the U6 snRNP contains a specific Lsm2-8 heptamer that comprises Lsm2, Lsm3, Lsm4, Lsm5, Lsm6, Lsm7, and Lsm83. Another Lsm heptameric complex, Lsm1-7, which differs from Lsm2-8 by one Lsm protein, is thought to function in mRNA decapping, a crucial step in the mRNA degradation pathway4.In yeast, mRNA degradation begins with deadenylation catalyzed mainly by the deadenylase Ccr4-Not complex to shorten the polyA tail5. Subsequently, whether the 3′-end of mRNA is bound by the Lsm1-7 complexes is an essential determinant for the directionality of mRNA degradation. In the absence of Lsm1-7, the exposed 3′-end of mRNA is captured by exosome and degradation begins from the 3′-end6. In the presence of Lsm1-7, the 3′-end of mRNA is recognized by the Pat1-Lsm1-7 complex6. Then the decapping enzymes Dcp1 and Dcp2 are recruited to decap mRNA, followed by Xrn1-mediated degradation from the 5′-end7.The Sm and Lsm proteins exhibit contrasting functions and distinct biochemical properties. First, the Sm proteins are located in the nucleus and only function in the spliceosome pathway of mRNA splicing. The Lsm proteins appear both in the nucleus and cytoplasm and are involved in various pathways of RNA metabolism. Second, the Sm proteins only assemble into a heptamer ring in the presence of snRNA, whereas the Lsm proteins can form two stable heptamer rings by themselves, the Lsm1-7 and Lsm2-8 complexes. The Sm ring binds the central part of snRNA whereas the Lsm2-8 ring recognizes the 3′-end of U6 snRNA8.Unlike the Sm proteins, whose heptameric ring can be readily assembled from stable heteromeric subcomplexes, the individually purified Lsm proteins, either alone or in heteromeric forms, failed to form a correctly assembled heptamer in the absence of denaturation/refolding. Lsm3 is known to form a stable homo-octamer by itself9; co-expression of Lsm5, Lsm6, and Lsm7 led to formation of a stable, but non-functional, hetero-hexamer10. In fact, every combination of hetero-dimeric or hetero-trimeric Lsm subcomplex would result in the formation of a stable oligomer, which can be reconstituted into a heptameric ring only by denaturation and refolding11. After numerous trials, we succeeded in co-expression of all seven Lsm proteins from S. cerevisiae using the pQLink plasmid12. The Lsm1-7 complex was biochemically purified to homogeneity (Supplementary information, Figure S1). Analysis by mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of all seven Lsm proteins.Despite rigorous trials, we were unable to crystallize the Lsm1-7 complex. To solve this problem, we launched a systematic protein engineering effort that involved removal of flexible sequences and mutation of cysteine to serine. Eventually we crystallized the Lsm1-7 complex in the P21 space group (Supplementary information, Figure S2). To facilitate structure determination, we also generated and crystallized the selenomethionine-labeled Lsm1-7 complex in the P1 space group. The structure of Lsm1-7 was determined by a combination of selenium-based single anomalous dispersion (SAD) and molecular replacement using the atomic coordinates of an archael Sm-like homo-heptamer (PDB code 1I8113). The final atomic model was refined at 3.0 Å resolution (Supplementary information, Table S1 and Figure S3).The overall appearance of the heptameric Lsm1-7 complex from S. cerevisiae resembles a thick donut, with an outer diameter of approximately 70 Å, an inner diameter of 5 Å, and a thickness of 45 Å (Figure 1A). The seven Lsm components sequentially interact with each other to form a closed ring, with the order of Lsm1-Lsm2-Lsm3-Lsm6-Lsm5-Lsm7-Lsm4. Except for Lsm1, each component within the ring only interacts with two neighboring Lsm proteins. For example, Lsm7 is in contact only with Lsm5 and Lsm4. The C-terminal sequence of Lsm1 forms an extended α-helix that crosses over the ring, with the ensuing loop associating with Lsm3 and Lsm6. The central hole of the Lsm1-7 ring is partially blocked by this α-helix from Lsm1, leaving a very small opening at the center of the ring. This structural feature contrasts that in the Lsm2-8 complex, where the central hole has a diameter of 15 Å8.Figure 1Structure of the Lsm1-7 heptameric complex from S. cerevisiae. (A) Overall structure of the Lsm1-7 complex in two perpendicular views. The seven Lsm subunits are color-coded. The central hole of the Lsm1-7 ring is partially blocked by a characteristic α-helix from the C-terminus of Lsm1. The crystallized Lsm1-7 complex contains five full-length Lsm proteins (Lsm2/3/5/6/7), residues 1-93 of Lsm4, and residues 30-173 of Lsm1. To facilitate crystallization, Cys45 of Lsm2 and Cys37/Cys63 of Lsm3 were mutated to Ser. (B) The Lsm1 subunit adopts an extended appearance in the Lsm1-7 ring. Unlike the other six Lsm subunits, the N- and C-terminal sequences of Lsm1 have well-defined structures that extend from the conserved Sm core fold. (C) Residues from the C-terminal sequence of Lsm1 interact with Lsm3 through hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and van der Waals contacts. (D) Residues from the C-terminal sequence of Lsm1 interact with Lsm6 through van der Waals contacts. (E) Asp36 of Lsm1 forms a salt bridge with Lys8 of Lsm2. (F) Structural overlay of the Lsm1-7 and Lsm2-8 complexes. These two complexes exhibit an RMSD of 0.89 Å over 461 aligned Cα atoms. Components of the Lsm1-7 ring are color-coded, whereas the Lsm2-8 ring (PDB code 4M78) is shown in grey. (G) Structural comparison between Lsm1 and Lsm8. (H) The Lsm1-7 ring binds to RNA sequences with micromolar affinities. Lsm1-7 only exhibits 3-fold lower binding affinity for the octa-nucleotide 5′-AAAAAAAA-3′ compared to 5′-UUUUUUUU-3′. By contrast, the Lsm2-8 complex preferentially binds the oligo-U element but exhibits a similar binding affinity for the oligo-A sequence as Lsm1-7. (I) Structural alignment of the conserved Arg residues between Lsm1-7 and Lsm2-8 (PDB code 4M7A). The residues in Lsm1-7 are colored, whereas the residues in Lsm2-8 are shown in grey. (J) Biochemical analysis of RNA binding by variants of the Lsm1-7 complex. The KD values in H and J were measured by Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) on a Fortebio Octet system. Each experiment was independently repeated three times, with the average value and standard deviation shown here.Full size imageUnlike the other six Lsm components, the N- and C-terminal sequences of Lsm1 have well-defined structures that extend out from the conserved Sm core fold (Figure 1B) and interact with neighboring Lsm subunits in the heptameric Lsm1-7 complex. Notably, a few amino acids from the C-terminal sequence of Lsm1 interact with Lsm3 and Lsm6 through hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) and van der Waals contacts (Figure 1C and 1D). In addition, Asp36 at the N-terminal loop of Lsm1 interacts with Lys8 of Lsm2 through a salt bridge (Figure 1E). These specific interactions likely constitute the basis why Lsm1, but not any other of the Lsm proteins, can replace Lsm8 to form a heptameric complex with Lsm2/3/4/5/6/7.The Lsm1-7 complex shares six common components with the heptameric Lsm2-8 complex, with Lsm1 in the Lsm1-7 complex substituted by Lsm8 in the Lsm2-8 complex. Consequently, the overall structures of these two complexes are very similar, with a root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of 0.89 Å over 461 aligned Cα atoms (Figure 1F). The main difference is between Lsm1 and Lsm8, which can be aligned to each other with an RMSD of 0.97 Å over 54 aligned Cα atoms in the core Sm fold (Figure 1G). Notably, these 54 aligned Cα atoms come from residues 32-115 of Lsm1 and residues 1-67 of Lsm8.Although the N- and C-terminal sequences of Lsm1 mediate interactions that are unique to the Lsm1-7 complex, the core Sm fold of Lsm1 appears to make a conserved set of interactions compared to Lsm8. Specifically, interactions between Lsm1 and Lsm2, including both main chain H-bonds and side chain van der Waals contacts, are similar to those between Lsm8 and Lsm2. The majority of the Lsm1-Lsm4 interactions are also preserved in the Lsm8-Lsm4 interface (Supplementary information, Figure S4).The Lsm1-7 complex plays an important role in RNA metabolism by facilitating degradation of mRNA. In yeast, the Lsm1-7 complex binds the 3′-end of mRNA and localizes to the P-bodies, ultimately resulting in mRNA degradation from the 5′-end4. We examined the RNA binding affinities of the Lsm1-7 complex using biolayer interferometry (BLI) on a Fortebio Octet system. The Lsm1-7 complex exhibits binding affinities of approximately 6 μM and 2 μM for the octa-nucleotides 5′-AAAAAAAA-3′ and 5′-UUUUUUUU-3′, respectively (Figure 1H). The binding affinity difference between the oligo-A and oligo-U sequences is only about 3-fold, suggesting that the Lsm1-7 complex may not recognize RNA sequences with the same level of specificity as the Lsm2-8 complex8. By contrast, the Lsm2-8 complex exhibits a binding affinity of about 20 nM for the oligo-U sequence, approximately 200-fold tighter than that for the oligo-A sequence (Figure 1H). These results suggest that the RNA binding mode of the Lsm1-7 complex may be similar to that of the Lsm2-8 complex towards the oligo-A, but not the oligo-U, sequence.Although Lsm1 and Lsm8 share limited sequence similarity, the RNA-binding residues in Lsm8 are largely preserved in Lsm1. For example, the D31xXxN35 and R57GX motifs in Lsm8 correspond to D72xXxN76 and R105GX in Lsm1, respectively. In addition, modeling studies suggest that the Lsm1-7 complex can bind to the 3′-end of oligo-U sequence similarly as the Lsm2-8 complex. However, the oligo-U binding affinity of Lsm1-7 is approximately 100-fold lower than that of Lsm2-8 (Figure 1H). Obviously, the sequence variation between Lsm1 and Lsm8 helps determine their RNA binding affinity as well as specificity. The molecular basis for this observation is likely to be revealed by the crystal structure of Lsm1-7 bound to RNA.An invariant Arg residue in Lsm6/3/2/8/4 plays an important role in RNA recognition by the Lsm2-8 complex8 (Figure 1I). We generated seven variants of the Lsm1-7 complex, each containing replacement of the conserved Arg (Ser in Lsm5) by Ala in one Lsm component, and examined their interactions with the oligo-A and oligo-U RNA elements (Figure 1J). As recently reported8, mutation of the conserved Arg to Ala in any of the Lsm6/3/2/8/4 subunits results in drastic reduction of binding affinity between the 3′-end U-rich sequence of U6 snRNA and the Lsm2-8 complex. In the Lsm1-7 complex, such point mutation in Lsm2 or Lsm3 caused the most pronounced reduction of RNA binding affinity to the oligo-U sequence (Figure 1J). By sharp contrast, such point mutation only caused modest changes (less than 2-fold) in binding affinities for the oligo-A sequence. This result is consistent with the observation that the Lsm1-7 complex exhibited a weak specificity for the oligo-U sequences (Figure 1H).In summary, we report the crystal structure of the heptameric Lsm1-7 complex and preliminary characterization of its RNA-binding properties. Our structural and biochemical characterization serves as a framework for mechanistic understanding of the function of Lsm1-7 complex in RNA metabolism. In the final phase of manuscript preparation, we noted publication of two related manuscripts14,15, of which Sharif et al.14 reported the crystal structure of Lsm1-7 without RNA binding studies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201418"
"cr","DUF221 proteins are a family of osmosensitive calcium-permeable cation channels conserved across eukaryotes","The flow of ions through channels in cell membranes, particularly the entry of calcium ions into the cytosol, serves as a cue for environmental responses in eukaryotes. In animals, calcium-permeable transient receptor potential (TRP) channels act as sensors for temperature, osmotic potential, and other environmental conditions1. Although plants also respond to myriad environmental perturbations with cytosolic calcium fluxes2, stress-gated calcium-permeable channels like TRPs in animals are not found in land plants. Several families of proteins, including glutamate receptor-like (GLR) proteins, cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (CNGCs), and annexins, have been linked to calcium fluxes in plant cells3. However, none of them has been shown to respond directly to stress signals. Because cytosolic calcium elevation is one of the earliest responses of plant cells to stress treatments1,4, and calcium-binding proteins are required for several environmental stress responses5, stress-activated calcium channels are candidates that may link stress stimuli to calcium-dependent downstream responses. We thus seek to isolate plant genes that encode possible calcium channels that are gated by stress signals, such as osmotic stress.Using heterologous expression of Arabidopsis genes in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells loaded with the calcium-responsive dye Fura-2, we screened uncharacterized integral membrane proteins for osmosensitive calcium conductance. These screens led to the identification of the Arabidopsis gene At4G22120, which encodes an integral membrane protein with eight or more predicted transmembrane helices. Ratiometric monitoring of Fura-2 fluorescence indicated that hyperosmotic shock treatment applied by 300 mM mannitol treatment induced calcium elevation in CHO cells expressing At4G22120 (UniProt: Q5XEZ5), whereas cells containing the empty vector control lacked discernible calcium elevation (Figure 1A). The observed calcium elevation occurred rapidly, peaking several seconds after hyperosmotic shock, and the calcium level sharply declined within 1 minute of osmotic shock (Figure 1B).Figure 1(A) Representative images taken from CHO cells transfected with empty pCDNA3 vector or the same vector harboring AtCSC1. These images show that AtCSC1-expressing CHO cells respond to hyperosmotic stress by cytosolic [Ca2+]i elevation not seen in control cells. [Ca2+]i changes are indicated by Fura-2 emission ratios (F340 nm/F380 nm) scaled by a pseudo-color bar in relative units. Hyperosmotic stress was applied by including 300 mM mannitol in isoosmotic saline solution. (B) Time course of intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i changes in AtCSC1-expressing CHO cells. Open and filled bars show the isoosmotic and hyperosmotic conditions, respectively. The average response of 10-20 cells from a representative experiment is presented. (C) (left) Typical whole-cell current traces recorded from AtCSC1-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes (AtCSC1) and the water-injected control oocyte (water) with periodic perfusion of saline solution containing 500 mM D-mannitol. (right) Current amplitudes evoked by the first application of hypersosmotic stress (n = 5). (D) Typical whole-cell current traces recorded from the AtCSC1-expressing oocytes perfused with bath solution containing 185 mM D-mannitol or 96 mM Na-gluconate (Na-glu) plus 500 mM D-mannitol.

(J) ML phylogenetic tree of DUF221-containing proteins created using PhyML v.2.2.0. Yellow stars mark the positions of AtCSC1, ScCSC1, and HsCSC1. Land plants contain four clades of CSCs, including one clade that clusters with metazoan homologs. One fungal clade contains an additional DUF3779, which is located at the C-terminus of these homologs. Support values (aLRT) are labeled for select clades. (K) Representative images taken from Fura-2-loaded CHO cells expressing ScCSC1 or HsCSC1 after they were treated with isoosmotic saline solution or hyperosmotic solution containing 300 mM mannitol. These data indicate that yeast and human CSC proteins are also osmosensitive, calcium-permeable cation channels. (L) (left) Typical whole-cell current traces recorded from water-injected or ScCSC1- or HsCSC1-expressing oocytes with periodic application of 500 mM D-mannitol. (right) The current amplitudes evoked by the first application of 500 mM D-mannitol (n = 5). The bars represent means ± SD. The holding potential was −60 mV.Full size imageBecause At4G22120 encodes a protein with multiple predicted transmembrane helices, we tested the possibility that it may form an influx cation channel permeable to calcium. We expressed the protein by injecting cRNA of this gene into Xenopus oocytes and performed whole-cell two-electrode voltage clamp (TEVC) analysis. Oocytes expressing the cRNA of the gene were placed in ND96 bath solution, and hyperosmotic shock was applied by perfusion with ND96 solution containing 500 mM mannitol. Hyperosmotic shock induced an inward current indicative of channel activation, and the observed current disappeared upon removal of osmotic shock, implicating channel closure (Figure 1C). The second osmotic shock induced a smaller inward current, suggesting response dampening upon repeated stimulation. These results indicate that the At4G22120 protein is an ion channel that can be activated by hyperosmotic shock. We therefore named this protein AtCSC1 as Arabidopsis Calcium permeable Stress-gated cation Channel 1.As expected of a channel, the current was barely detectable when equal molarity of mannitol (185 mM) was used to replace the major charge carrier NaCl in the ND96 solution, even after the same hyperosmotic shock (Figure 1D). Replacement of 185 mM mannitol with 96 mM Na+-gluconate restored channel conductance in response to the hyperosmotic treatment (Figure 1D), suggesting that the channel specifically conducts cations (i.e., Na+) rather than the much larger gluconate anions. Further analyses revealed that AtCSC1 is permeable to various cations, including Ca2+, K+, and Na+ (Figure 1E).To further investigate AtCSC1 activation, we applied hyperosmotic stress to AtCSC1-expressing oocytes using various concentrations of mannitol or NaCl. Channel conductance showed dependence on D-mannitol concentration in the extracellular buffer, with 300 mM or higher concentrations sufficient for channel activation (Supplementary information, Figure S1). Hyperosmotic shock could be applied with 250 mM NaCl substituted for 500 mM mannitol, and it similarly activated AtCSC1 (Figure 1F). The currents induced by mannitol or NaCl treatment abated quickly after removal of hyperosmotic shock. This observation piqued our interest in AtCSC1 channel closure, therefore we tested the hyperosmotic shock responses of AtCSC1-expressing oocytes with 500 mM mannitol under calcium-free conditions. The channel activated in response to hyperosmotic shock but failed to inactivate after removal of osmotic shock until perfusion was resumed with ND96 solution containing 1.8 mM Ca2+(Figure 1G), indicating that inactivation or closure of the AtCSC1 channel is calcium-dependent. The currents conducted by AtCSC1 occurred instantaneously upon application of hyperosmotic shock and were time-independent (i.e., activation was not gradual). Stepwise voltage analysis indicated that the channel is non-rectifying (Figure 1H). A previous proteomics study indicates that AtCSC1 localizes to the plasma membrane6, which is consistent with its apparent localization in our CHO and oocyte experiments.According to hydrophobicity plots and the MetaTM webserver (http://metatm.sbc.su.se), which predicts transmembrane protein topology using a consensus approach of popular transmembrane helix prediction algorithms, AtCSC1 contains two clusters of transmembrane (TM) helices (Figure 1I). The N-terminal region contains three predicted TM helices, however we postulate that the first predicted helix may act as a cleavable signal peptide. The C-terminal region comprising domain of unknown function 221 (DUF221) contains six predicted TM helices, therefore the AtCSC1 protein likely contains eight TM helices in total and may constitute the pore-forming entity of an ion channel. The two clusters of TM helices appear to be linked by a roughly 200 amino acid cytosolic loop.Homologs of AtCSC1 with conserved membrane topology were identified among nearly all studied eukaryotes, including baker's yeast, fruit flies, and humans. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that land plants contain 4 ancient clades of AtCSC1 homologs and that Arabidopsis contains at least 15 CSCs (Figure 1J and Supplementary information, Figure S2). We identified four CSC homologs in the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and cloned one of these homologs, ScYLR241W, for heterologous expression and electrophysiological characterization. Like AtCSC1, ScYLR241W showed osmotically gated calcium conductance when heterologously expressed in CHO cells and similar electrophysiological properties to AtCSC1 in oocytes (Figure 1K and 1L), therefore we named this protein ScCSC1. Three AtCSC1 orthologs were identified among all sequenced vertebrates. We characterized one homolog from human, HsTM63C (UniProt: Q9P1W3), in CHO cells and Xenopus oocytes, as described for AtCSC1 and ScYLR241W. HsTM63C showed similar gating properties and conductance to AtCSC1 and ScYLR241W, therefore we designated this gene HsCSC1 (Figure 1K and 1L). These data for ScCSC1 and HsCSC1 provide further support for our hypothesis that CSC homologs constitute a previously unidentified family of osmosensitive, calcium-permeable cation channels in eukaryotes.Published expression data indicate that several Arabidopsis CSCs are transcriptionally upregulated in response to various abiotic stresses and biotic stresses, which both entail mechanical perturbation. Indeed, some CSC proteins were previously named Early Response to Dehydration (ERD) 4 proteins based on their expression profile7. According to Pfam, DUF221 belongs to the anoctamin-like clan and is homologous to domains in anoctamin/TMEM16 channels, which are calcium-activated chloride channel (CaCC) components8, and transmembrane channel-like (TMC) proteins. TMCs are cation channel components, and certain TMCs are required for salt chemosensation in C. elegans9 and hearing in mammals10. Our data establish that CSCs are a family of cation channels that are permeable to calcium and gated by physical signals such as hyperosmotic stress. These properties are reminiscent of TRPs in animals and make CSCs intriguing candidates for involvement in osmo- or mechano-sensitive calcium signaling processes in plants. Given their conservation in distantly related eukaryotes including fungi and animals, this study opens new avenues for research towards understanding the function of this novel family of ion channels not only in plants but also in other eukaryotes.Detailed methods are described in the Supplementary information, Data S1.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201414"
"cr","One-step generation of knockout pigs by zygote injection of CRISPR/Cas system","The pig is an important livestock for food supply and an ideal model for various human diseases. Efficient and precise genetic engineering in pigs holds great promise in agriculture and biomedicine1. Using currently available approach, generating specific gene modifications in pigs requires two steps. First, site-specific nucleases such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are used to generate targeted mutations in pig somatic cells. Then the engineered somatic nucleus is used to generate cloned animals using somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technology2,3. The complex design and generation of ZFNs and TALENs, as well as the technical challenges of SCNT, greatly limit the application of this method.Recently a new type of site-specific nuclease was identified in CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) RNA-based adaptive immune system in bacteria and archaea4. The Cas9 endonuclease from Streptococcus pyogenes type II CRISPR/Cas system can be engineered to produce targeted genome modification under the guidance of a synthetic single guide RNA (sgRNA) with simple base-pair complementarities with a target genomic DNA sequence5,6,7. Although highly efficient one-step generation of mice and rats carrying single or multiple mutations have been achieved through direct injection of CRISPR/Cas system into one-cell embryo8,9, it remains to be tested whether the same strategy could be applied to generation of genome-engineered large animals. Here we report the efficient generation of biallelic knockout pigs in one step by direct cytoplasmic injection of Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA into zygotes.To demonstrate the application of genome engineering in disease modeling and agriculture, we chose to target vWF gene, whose deficiency in human causes severe von Willebrand disease (vWD)10 (Supplementary information, Figure S1). As mouse model does not fully recapitulate the disease phenotype and response to treatment in human patients, a large animal model with similar size of organ and circulatory system is highly desirable. In food industry, bleeding is an important procedure before meat production, as the leftover blood is an ideal medium for bacterial growth. vWF knockout could improve bleeding efficiency for slaughtering procedures and blood collection.We designed an sgRNA targeting exon 5 of the pig vWF gene, which lies in the first trysin-inhibitor-like domain and its mutation could lead to the loss of function of vWF protein. The in vitro developmental efficiencies of embryos injected with Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA (∼79%) and embryos injected with water (∼77%) were both very high and comparable with each other, suggesting that the microinjection manipulation and the Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA had little effect on pig early embryonic development (Supplementary information, Table S1).We next transferred the injected embryos into surrogate pigs to produce piglets. A total of 76 injected embryos were transplanted into 5 surrogate mothers in 5 independent experiments. Three surrogates were successfully pregnant and delivered a total of 16 piglets (Figure 1A). T7 endonuclease I (T7EI) assay showed that 10 piglets contained insertions or deletions (indels) in the targeting site, indicating that vWF mutation efficiency reached about 63% (10/16) (Figure 1A and 1B). We further analyzed the genotype by Sanger sequencing of the PCR products containing the targeting site of each individual piglet. The sequencing results confirmed the indels and revealed that one mutant pig yielding uncut PCR product in the T7EI assay (fourth lane in Figure 1B) contained only one type of mutant allele. Most pigs contained more than two different alleles (Figure 1C, pig #4 and #11), suggesting that the Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage may occur at embryonic stage later than the one-cell stage, as previously observed with ZFN, TALEN and CRISPR-mediated targeting11. In each pig, if no wild-type allele was detected by sequencing, we categorized the pig as biallelic mutant. If both wild-type and mutant alleles were observed in the sequence reads, we categorized the pig as monoallelic mutant, although the ratio of wild-type to mutant alleles might not always be 1. In total, we identified six vWF biallelic mutant piglets and five monoallelic mutant piglets (11/16, 68%) (Figure 1A and 1C). Of these piglets, two died shortly after birth and the other 14 survived until now (Figure 1D). The high birth rate (16/76, 21%) and survival rate (14/16, 88%) indicated that Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA had little toxicity to pig embryonic development (Figure 1A). These results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas system could efficiently generate both monoallelic and biallelic mutant pigs in one step through direct zygote injection.Figure 1Generation of vWF-knockout pigs using the CRISPR/Cas system and phenotypic analyses. (A) Summary of generated vWF mutant pigs via zygote injection of Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA. Two piglets #7 and #8 died soon after birth. Biallelic mutant pigs are #3, #4, #7, #9, #10 and #11.

Five wild-type pigs, three monoallelic mutant pigs and five biallelic mutant pigs are included in the assays shown in F-H. The P values are calculated using Student's t-test. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD).Full size imageWe further examined whether the vWF mutations cause the vWD phenotypes. Western blot analysis showed that the vWF expression in lung was largely reduced in monoallelic mutant pigs, and was undetectable in biallelic mutant pigs, confirming the vWF knockout at protein levels (Figure 1E). We next performed hematological analysis with pigs having different genotypes. The plasma vWF antigen level was significantly reduced in the monoallelic mutant pig group, and was nearly undetectable in biallelic mutant group (Figure 1F). In human vWD, the level of coagulation factor FVIII may be reduced due to rapid degradation in the absence of vWF10. Consistently, the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)-based assay for FVIII activity showed a significantly lower activity in the biallelic mutant group, indicating that FVIII level was decreased in the plasma of vWF-null pigs (Figure 1G). No significant differences were observed between wild-type and knockout pigs with regard to other parameters in the hematological analysis (Supplementary information, Table S2). The most prominent phenotype resulting from vWF mutation is a severe bleeding tendency10. We found that the bleeding time of biallelic mutant pigs (512 ± 121 min) was much longer than that of wild-type pigs (34 ± 11 min) (Figure 1H). Taken together, our results demonstrate that the one-step generated biallelic mutant pigs developed similar phenotypes of the human vWD.A certain level of off-target cleavage by CRISPR/Cas system was suggested by recent studies in human cell lines12, indicating that Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage tolerates small numbers of mismatches between sgRNA and target DNA especially in protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-distal region12. We thus sought to test the possible off-target effects in genome-modified pigs derived from zygote injection. By screening the genome based on sequence homology (> 14 base pair identity to 3′ end of the sgRNA spacer), around 20 potential off-target sites were found (Supplementary information, Figure S2). In all 11 mutant animals tested, none of them contained indels at 2 randomly chosen sites based on T7EI assay (Supplementary information, Figure S2). We further analyzed the potential off-target effects by Sanger sequencing of 10 randomly selected potential off-target sites in 3 biallelic mutant pigs (#9, #10 and #11). None of the sequencing reads had mutations, suggesting no off-target effects at these sites (Supplementary information, Figure S2). However, we could not exclude the possible existence of certain off-target effects due to the high number of potential off-target sites. Thus a systematic off-target evaluation would be needed in the future before the wide application of such knockout pig models. Also, modified CRISPR/Cas-methods with less off-target tendency can be used for genome engineering in pigs and other large animals13.Germline transmission of the mutations to next generation is essential for expanding the knockout pig population. To examine the germline transmission potential of the mutations, we dissected an ovary from a monoallelic mutant female pig and a testis from a biallelic mutant male pig by biopsy and analyzed their genotypes by Sanger sequencing. Both the ovary and the testis were morphologically normal (Supplementary information, Figure S3). More than half sequence reads of the ovary and all the sequence reads of the testis were mutant, indicating that the mutations had been efficiently transmitted into the germline (Supplementary information, Figure S3). Considering the highly efficient germline transmission in rodents using the same procedure14, germline transmission of the mutations to next generation is highly expected.In summary, we have shown that zygote injection of the CRISPR/Cas system can efficiently generate genome-modified pigs in one step, resulting in rapid establishment of large animal model for important human diseases. The high efficiency of Cas9-mediated genome editing in pigs demonstrated here, together with the versatile functionality of the CRISPR/Cas system such as multiplexed genome editing and epigenetic modification5, opens up unlimited possibilities of genome engineering in livestock for applications in agriculture and biomedicine.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201411"
"cr","Mammalian WTAP is a regulatory subunit of the RNA N6-methyladenosine methyltransferase","The methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3)-containing methyltransferase complex catalyzes the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) formation, a novel epitranscriptomic marker; however, the nature of this complex remains largely unknown. Here we report two new components of the human m6A methyltransferase complex, Wilms' tumor 1-associating protein (WTAP) and methyltransferase like 14 (METTL14). WTAP interacts with METTL3 and METTL14, and is required for their localization into nuclear speckles enriched with pre-mRNA processing factors and for catalytic activity of the m6A methyltransferase in vivo. The majority of RNAs bound by WTAP and METTL3 in vivo represent mRNAs containing the consensus m6A motif. In the absence of WTAP, the RNA-binding capability of METTL3 is strongly reduced, suggesting that WTAP may function to regulate recruitment of the m6A methyltransferase complex to mRNA targets. Furthermore, transcriptomic analyses in combination with photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) illustrate that WTAP and METTL3 regulate expression and alternative splicing of genes involved in transcription and RNA processing. Morpholino-mediated knockdown targeting WTAP and/or METTL3 in zebrafish embryos caused tissue differentiation defects and increased apoptosis. These findings provide strong evidence that WTAP may function as a regulatory subunit in the m6A methyltransferase complex and play a critical role in epitranscriptomic regulation of RNA metabolism.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20143"
"cr","Generation of transgenic golden Syrian hamsters","Golden Syrian hamsters are small rodents, but they display many features that resemble the physiology and metabolism of humans. Hamsters have been widely used in many research areas, including carcinogenesis1, reproduction2, virology3, diabetes4 and cardiovascular diseases5. With respect to lipid and glucose metabolism, hamsters, like humans, exhibit high levels of cholesteryl ester transport protein (CETP), intestinal-only ApoB editing, low levels of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity6 and a high glycemic response to dietary fructose7, all of which are not observed in other rodents such as mice and rats. Consequently, hamsters, like humans, exhibit enhanced susceptibility to atherosclerosis (AS) and diabetes8, which led to the widespread use of hamsters in studies on AS and diabetes.In the past 2-3 decades, due to the fast development of transgenic and knockout mice, hamsters were gradually replaced by these mouse models. However, due to multiple differences between mice and humans with respect to physiology and metabolism, the use of gene-manipulated mice has limited value in disease modeling and pathophysiological studies. Extensive literature search has revealed an absence of reports on genetically manipulated hamster models. To capitalize on the special metabolic features of hamsters, we aim to generate gene-manipulated hamsters as an alternate rodent model for general applications. As the initial step to create a genetically manipulated hamster, we utilized a highly efficient lentiviral vector to generate transgenic hamsters expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP).By modifying and optimizing the protocols for producing transgenic mice and rabbits in our laboratory9,10, we developed a specific procedure for hamster superovulation, fertilized egg harvesting, perivitelline space microinjection and embryo transfer. After the successful culture of fertilized hamster eggs that developed into 4- and 8-cell embryos in vitro (Figure 1A), we implanted these embryos into pseudopregnant females. We obtained 7-10 pups/litter in 4 out of 7 surrogate mothers. Next, we microinjected 50-100 picoliters of a lentiviral eGFP vector (Figure 1B) at a titer of 2 × 109 titer units/ml into the perivitelline space of the fertilized eggs to generate transgenic hamsters that express eGFP.Figure 1Generation of transgenic golden Syrian hamsters. (A) Fertilized hamster eggs cultured in HECM-10 medium developed into 4- and 8-cell embryos in vitro. (B) Diagram of the lentiviral pLOV-UbiC-EGFP vector used to generate transgenic hamsters. The vector consists of an LTR (long terminal repeat), the human ubiquitin C promoter, and a sequence encoding eGFP and WPRE (woodchuck posttranscriptional regulatory element). The EcoRI restriction site was used for Southern blot analysis. (C) eGFP PCR in the founders (F0, lanes 1# - 6#) and in first generation (F1, lanes 1-5) animals generated from founder 6#.

Thirty micrograms (for F0 hamsters) or 10 μg (for F1 hamsters) of genomic DNA were digested with EcoRI. The transgene was detected using a 591-bp DIG-labeled probe against the eGFP sequence.

Each pair of organs is arranged with the non-transgenic animal on the left and the eGFP-transgenic animal on the right. (H) Flow cytometry analysis of peritoneal macrophages (left) and bone marrow cells (right) from one F1 hamster. The results for non-transgenic animals are depicted in gray, and the results for eGFP-transgenic animals are depicted with red or blue lines.Full size imageA total of 6 out of 32 live-born pups from 5 surrogate mothers each receiving 30-40 microinjected eggs were identified as being eGFP-positive by PCR genotyping, and 5 of the pups were further validated by Southern blot analysis (Figure 1C and 1D). Of the 5 positive pups validated by Southern blotting, 2 of them (males) expressed eGFP in the exposed skin area as determined by direct fluorescence imaging (Figure 1E). Transgenic lines were then established by breeding the 2 founders (F0) with non-transgenic females. Among the progenies from 3 litters, 21% of the animals were eGFP-positive as determined by direct fluorescence imaging. Representative fluorescence images of the first generation (F1) pups from one of the 3 litters are shown in Figure 1F. All the examined organs from one eGFP-positive F1 pup showed strong-to-moderate levels of green fluorescence, which include the liver, kidney, heart, skeletal muscle, lung, brain, white/brown adipose tissues, adrenal glands and eyes; however, no fluorescence was observed in these organs of the littermate control (Figure 1G and data not shown). The peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow cells from another eGFP-transgenic F1 hamster also demonstrated an approximately 70% eGFP-positive cell population as analyzed by FACS (Figure 1H).With the establishment of transgenic hamster model in the present study, it is now possible to generate small rodent disease models that recapitulate human pathogenesis. For example, generation of a transgenic hamster overexpressing proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a protein involved in cholesterol homeostasis by inducing LDL receptor degradation, will be highly desirable. Although mice and pigs overexpressing PCSK9 developed hypercholesterolemia and AS11, these animals, unlike humans, do not express CETP, a critical factor involved in lipid transport and AS development.Along with the recent development of genome-editing methods such as TALENs (transcription activator-like effector nucleases) and the CRISPR/Cas system (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated system)12, the generation of gene-targeted hamster models is thus warranted in conjunction with the hamster embryo manipulation method optimized in the present study. These hamster models will be utilized extensively in studies for metabolic cardiovascular diseases and will become the candidate models when genomics and proteomics tools are fully developed for this species in the future. Genetically altered hamsters may potentially replace mice as the mainstream animal model for metabolic cardiovascular research. Therefore, the present study will promote the use of genetically engineered hamsters as disease models. These models might recapitulate many features of human metabolic disorders while simultaneously retaining the ease of handling, the simplicity of management and the cost efficiency of small rodents as compared to genetically engineered large animals such as mini-pigs13 or non-human primates14.Detailed methods are described in the Supplementary information, Data S1.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20142"
"cr","Translocation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein to plasma membrane leads to necrotic cell death","Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) was identified to function downstream of receptor interacting protein 3 (RIP3) in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF)-induced necrosis (also called necroptosis). However, how MLKL functions to mediate necroptosis is unknown. By reconstitution of MLKL function in MLKL-knockout cells, we showed that the N-terminus of MLKL is required for its function in necroptosis. The oligomerization of MLKL in TNF-treated cells is essential for necroptosis, as artificially forcing MLKL together by using the hormone-binding domain (HBD*) triggers necroptosis. Notably, forcing together the N-terminal domain (ND) but not the C-terminal kinase domain of MLKL causes necroptosis. Further deletion analysis showed that the four-α-helix bundle of MLKL (1-130 amino acids) is sufficient to trigger necroptosis. Both the HBD*-mediated and TNF-induced complexes of MLKL(ND) or MLKL are tetramers, and translocation of these complexes to lipid rafts of the plasma membrane precedes cell death. The homo-oligomerization is required for MLKL translocation and the signal sequence for plasma membrane location is located in the junction of the first and second α-helices of MLKL. The plasma membrane translocation of MLKL or MLKL(ND) leads to sodium influx, and depletion of sodium from the cell culture medium inhibits necroptosis. All of the above phenomena were not seen in apoptosis. Thus, the MLKL oligomerization leads to translocation of MLKL to lipid rafts of plasma membrane, and the plasma membrane MLKL complex acts either by itself or via other proteins to increase the sodium influx, which increases osmotic pressure, eventually leading to membrane rupture.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013171"
"cr","Planar substrate-binding site dictates the specificity of ECF-type nickel/cobalt transporters","The energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters are multi-subunit protein complexes that mediate uptake of transition-metal ions and vitamins in about 50% of the prokaryotes, including bacteria and archaea. Biological and structural studies have been focused on ECF transporters for vitamins, but the molecular mechanism by which ECF systems transport metal ions from the environment remains unknown. Here we report the first crystal structure of a NikM, TtNikM2, the substrate-binding component (S component) of an ECF-type nickel transporter from Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis. In contrast to the structures of the vitamin-specific S proteins with six transmembrane segments (TSs), TtNikM2 possesses an additional TS at its N-terminal region, resulting in an extracellular N-terminus. The highly conserved N-terminal loop inserts into the center of TtNikM2 and occludes a region corresponding to the substrate-binding sites of the vitamin-specific S components. Nickel binds to NikM via its coordination to four nitrogen atoms, which are derived from Met1, His2 and His67 residues. These nitrogen atoms form an approximately square-planar geometry, similar to that of the metal ion-binding sites in the amino-terminal Cu2+- and Ni2+-binding (ATCUN) motif. Replacements of residues in NikM contributing to nickel coordination compromised the Ni-transport activity. Furthermore, systematic quantum chemical investigation indicated that this geometry enables NikM to also selectively recognize Co2+. Indeed, the structure of TtNikM2 containing a bound Co2+ ion has almost no conformational change compared to the structure that contains a nickel ion. Together, our data reveal an evolutionarily conserved mechanism underlying the metal selectivity of EcfS proteins, and provide insights into the ion-translocation process mediated by ECF transporters.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013172"
"cr","Cholecystokinin from the entorhinal cortex enables neural plasticity in the auditory cortex","Patients with damage to the medial temporal lobe show deficits in forming new declarative memories but can still recall older memories, suggesting that the medial temporal lobe is necessary for encoding memories in the neocortex. Here, we found that cortical projection neurons in the perirhinal and entorhinal cortices were mostly immunopositive for cholecystokinin (CCK). Local infusion of CCK in the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats induced plastic changes that enabled cortical neurons to potentiate their responses or to start responding to an auditory stimulus that was paired with a tone that robustly triggered action potentials. CCK infusion also enabled auditory neurons to start responding to a light stimulus that was paired with a noise burst. In vivo intracellular recordings in the auditory cortex showed that synaptic strength was potentiated after two pairings of presynaptic and postsynaptic activity in the presence of CCK. Infusion of a CCKB antagonist in the auditory cortex prevented the formation of a visuo-auditory association in awake rats. Finally, activation of the entorhinal cortex potentiated neuronal responses in the auditory cortex, which was suppressed by infusion of a CCKB antagonist. Together, these findings suggest that the medial temporal lobe influences neocortical plasticity via CCK-positive cortical projection neurons in the entorhinal cortex.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013164"
"cr","Identification of IFN-γ-producing innate B cells","Although B cells play important roles in the humoral immune response and the regulation of adaptive immunity, B cell subpopulations with unique phenotypes, particularly those with non-classical immune functions, should be further investigated. By challenging mice with Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, vesicular stomatitis virus and Toll-like receptor ligands, we identified an inducible CD11ahiFcγRIIIhi B cell subpopulation that is significantly expanded and produces high levels of IFN-γ during the early stage of the immune response. This subpopulation of B cells can promote macrophage activation via generating IFN-γ, thereby facilitating the innate immune response against intracellular bacterial infection. As this new subpopulation is of B cell origin and exhibits the phenotypic characteristics of B cells, we designated these cells as IFN-γ-producing innate B cells. Dendritic cells were essential for the inducible generation of these innate B cells from the follicular B cells via CD40L-CD40 ligation. Increased Bruton's tyrosine kinase activation was found to be responsible for the increased activation of non-canonical NF-κB pathway in these innate B cells after CD40 ligation, with the consequent induction of additional IFN-γ production. The identification of this new population of innate B cells may contribute to a better understanding of B cell functions in anti-infection immune responses and immune regulation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013155"

Here, we show that Lsm2 and Lsm3 bridge the interaction between the C-terminus of Pat1 (Pat1C) and the Lsm1-7 complex. The Lsm2-3-Pat1C complex and the Lsm1-7-Pat1C complex stimulate decapping in vitro to a similar extent and exhibit similar RNA-binding preference. The crystal structure of the Lsm2-3-Pat1C complex shows that Pat1C binds to Lsm2-3 to form an asymmetric complex with three Pat1C molecules surrounding a heptameric ring formed by Lsm2-3. Structure-based mutagenesis revealed the importance of Lsm2-3-Pat1C interactions in decapping activation in vivo. Based on the structure of Lsm2-3-Pat1C, a model of Lsm1-7-Pat1 complex is constructed and how RNA binds to this complex is discussed.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013152"

Defects in PTMs have been linked to numerous developmental disorders and human diseases, highlighting the importance of PTMs in maintaining normal cellular states. Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), including embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into a variety of functional somatic cells; these cells hold a great promise for the advancement of biomedical research and clinical therapy. The mechanisms underlying cellular pluripotency in human cells have been extensively explored in the past decade. In addition to the vast amount of knowledge obtained from the genetic and transcriptional research in hPSCs, there is a rapidly growing interest in the stem cell biology field to examine pluripotency at the protein and PTM level. This review addresses recent progress toward understanding the role of PTMs (glycosylation, phosphorylation, acetylation and methylation) in the regulation of cellular pluripotency.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013151"
"cr","Characterization of two distinct neuraminidases from avian-origin human-infecting H7N9 influenza viruses","An epidemic of an avian-origin H7N9 influenza virus has recently emerged in China, infecting 134 patients of which 45 have died. This is the first time that an influenza virus harboring an N9 serotype neuraminidase (NA) has been known to infect humans. H7N9 viruses are divergent and at least two distinct NAs and hemagglutinins (HAs) have been found, respectively, from clinical isolates. The prototypes of these viruses are A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/1/2013. NAs from these two viruses are distinct as the A/Shanghai/1/2013 NA has an R294K substitution that can confer NA inhibitor oseltamivir resistance. Oseltamivir is by far the most commonly used anti-influenza drug due to its potency and high bioavailability. In this study, we show that an R294K substitution results in multidrug resistance with extreme oseltamivir resistance (over 100 000-fold) using protein- and virus-based assays. To determine the molecular basis for the inhibitor resistance, we solved high-resolution crystal structures of NAs from A/Anhui/1/2013 N9 (R294-containing) and A/Shanghai/1/2013 N9 (K294-containing). R294K substitution results in an unfavorable E276 conformation for oseltamivir binding, and consequently loss of inhibitor carboxylate interactions, which compromises the binding of all classical NA ligands/inhibitors. Moreover, we found that R294K substitution results in reduced NA catalytic efficiency along with lower viral fitness. This helps to explain why K294 has predominantly been found in clinical cases of H7N9 infection under the selective pressure of oseltamivir treatment and not in the dominant human-infecting viruses. This implies that oseltamivir can still be efficiently used in the treatment of H7N9 infections.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013144"
"cr","Structure reveals that BAK1 as a co-receptor recognizes the BRI1-bound brassinolide","In animals, steroid hormones play critical roles in many vital physiological processes. Brassinosteroids (BRs) produced by plants have similar structures to the animal steroid hormones and play indispensable roles in plant growth and development1. BRs have now acknowledgedly become a sixth class of plant hormones.In contrast to animal steroid hormones that bind to nuclear receptors, BRs are recognized by the cell surface receptor BRASSINOSTEROID-INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1)2 and its homologs3. BRI1 belongs to a large family of plant leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor kinases (RKs), characterized by an extracellular ligand-sensing domain and an intracellular kinase domain. The extracellular domain of BRI1 contains 25 LRRs (BRI1LRR) and an island domain. Recognition of brassinolide (BL), the most active BR identified thus far, by BRI1LRR is through a surface pocket embedded in a 70-aa island (residues 587-656) domain4,5. BR binding greatly enhances BRI1 heteromerization with a second RK, BRI1-associated kinase 1 (BAK1, also known as SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 3, SERK3)6,7. The BR-induced BRI1-BAK1 stable association initiates a phosphorylation-mediated cascade transducing the extracellular steroid signal to transcriptional programs1,3. This process is accompanied with dissociation of a BRI1 kinase inhibitor 1 (BKI1) from the intracellular domain of BRI13. Several models on BR-induced BRI1 activation have been proposed1,4,5,8. However, whether BAK1 acts as a regulator or co-receptor of BRI1 and how BR binding promotes BRI1-BAK1 interaction are not well understood.To test whether the extracellular domains of BRI1 and BAK1 are sufficient to form a BL-induced complex, we expressed the LRR domains of Arabidopsis BRI1 (residues 24-784, BRI1LRR) and BAK1 (residues 1-220, BAK1LRR) in insect cells, purified the proteins to homogeneity, and tested their interaction using a gel filtration assay. Unexpectedly, when assayed with a buffer at pH 8.0, the BRI1LRR and BAK1LRR proteins did not form a stable complex (Figure 1A). As binding of BL to BRI1 occurs in the extracellular acidic space, we reasoned that lowering pH may favor formation of BL-induced BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR complexes. In complete agreement with the prediction, the two proteins strongly interacted with each other at pH 4.0 in the presence of BL, as indicated by co-migration of the two proteins in gel filtration, which was dependent on the existence of BL (Figure 1A). These results indicate that the extracellular domains of BRI1 and BAK1 interact with each other in a BL- and pH-dependent manner. The complex was eluted at the position corresponding to a monomeric BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR (∼100 kD), suggesting that BL binding induces no homodimerization of the BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR complex.Figure 1BAK1LRR recognizes the BRI1LRR-bound BL to form a pH-dependent BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR heterodimer.

(E) Direct interaction between BRI1LRR and BAK1LRR. Residues from BAK1LRR and BRI1LRR are labeled in black and purple, respectively.Full size imageWe then solved the crystal structure of the BRI1LRR-BL-BAK1LRR complex at a resolution of 3.6 Å (Supplementary information, Table S1). The BRI1LRR-organized complex is assembled with a 1:1:1 stoichiometry (Figure 1B). Supporting the gel filtration data, no homodimeric complexes were formed in the structure. Structural comparison showed that the conformations of BRI1LRR in the BAK1LRR-free and BAK1LRR-bound forms are markedly similar (Figure 1C), indicating that BAK1LRR binding induces no striking conformational changes in the extracellular domain of BRI1. As predicted from sequence alignment6,7, BAK1LRR contains five LRRs (Figure 1B). Its N-terminal capping domain can be well superimposed (Supplementary information, Figure S1) with those of BRI1LRR and BRL1LRR9, supporting the idea that plant LRR proteins possess a conserved N-terminal domain as suggested before4.Both BL and receptors mediate BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR heterodimerization. The N-terminal side of BAK1LRR makes contacts with the BRI1-bound BL (Figure 1B), resulting in the sandwich of BL between the two proteins and a nearly complete burial of the BL surface area (∼4 Å2 after BAK1LRR binding). Contacts of the inner surface side of BAK1LRR with one lateral side of the last two LRRs from BRI1LRR form more extensive and direct BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR interactions. Ligand-induced homo- or hetero-dimers of toll-like receptors (TLRs) typically have “m-shaped” structures10. The structural organization of the BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR dimeric complex is strikingly different from those of the TLR dimers. Nevertheless, the C-termini of BAK1LRR and BRI1LRR are similarly oriented (Figure 1B), presumably pointing to the membrane surface.In the structure, BL was well defined by electron density (Supplementary information, Figure S2), interacting with BRI1LRR as observed before4,5. In addition to BRI1LRR, BL also interacts with the N-terminal side of BAK1LRR mainly through the fused ring portion, bridging BRI1LRR and BAK1LRR together (Figure 1B and Supplementary information, Figure S3). This structural observation supports our previous proposal5 that BL induces BRI1-BAK1 interaction through creating a novel surface on BRILRR. BAK1Trp59, Phe60, His61 from the N-terminal capping domain are important for recognizing BL (Figure 1D). Specifically, the side chain of BAK1Phe60 tightly packs in parallel against one side of BL, substantially reducing the solvent accessible area of BL. Hydrogen bonding interactions of the three BAK1 residues with BL appear important for BAK1 recognition of the BRI1LRR-bound BL. The hydroxyl group from C3 of BL forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of BAK1Trp59 and the nitrogen of BAK1His61, whereas the hydroxyl group from C2 hydrogen bonds with the side chain and amide nitrogen of BAK1His61. In strong support of the important role for the hydrogen bonds in BL-induced BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR interaction, previous studies showed that modification either of the two hydroxyl groups greatly reduced the bioactivity of BL or its derivatives11.In addition to the BL-mediated interactions, BRI1LRR and BAK1LRR make extensive and direct contacts via packing of the inner surface of BAK1LRR against the last two LRRs of BRI1LRR (Figure 1B). A cluster of bulky amino acids including BAK1Tyr96, Tyr100, Tyr124, Arg143, Phe144, Arg146, establishes van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions with those from the C-terminal side of BRI1LRR (Figure 1E). BRI1Thr750 is located at the center of the cluster and makes tight contacts with BAK1Tyr96. Strained by the limited space around BRI1Thr750, substitution of this residue with a bulkier one is expected to perturb the direct BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR interactions. Indeed, the BRI1T750I mutation was shown to greatly compromise BL-induced signaling12, providing functional evidence for our structural observation. In addition to the van der Waals and hydrophobic contacts, polar interactions also contribute to the direct BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR interface (Figure 1E). BAK1Arg146 makes a pair of salt bridges with BRI1Glu749, whereas the side chain of BAK1Asp74 hydrogen bonds to that of BRI1Gln747. BAK1Asp122 is submerged among the BRI1-interacting cluster but makes no interaction with BRI1LRR. Mutation of this residue to asparagine, however, generates a gain-of-function phenotype13. The mechanism underlying this remains unclear, but glycosylation of the mutant protein at this position is unlikely responsible for the phenotype, because this would generate steric clashes with BRI1LRR. One possibility is that the mutation changed the local polarity and consequently the conformations of its surrounding BRI1-interacting residues, which in turn facilitates BRI1-BAK1 interaction. All the BL- and BRI1-interacting amino acids of BAK1 are highly conserved among other SERK members (Supplementary information, Figure S4).In the current study, we solved the crystal structure of the BRI1LRR-BL-BAK1LRR complex, explaining a body of previous observations. The formation of the BL-induced BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR complex is stringently dependent on pH, with lower pH promoting the BL-induced BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR interaction. Two possible mechanisms can be proposed to explain the pH-dependent BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR heterodimerization induced by BL. Lowering pH may promote protonation of the amide nitrogen of BAK1His61 and allow it to act as two hydrogen bond donors for interaction with the two neighboring hydroxyl groups from the fused ring of BL. Alternatively or additionally, the pH-dependent BL-induced BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR interaction may also be associated with conformations of the residues surrounding BAK1Asp122 that generates a gain-of-function phenotype when mutated to asparagine13. A basic pH might generate a different effect on conformations of those BAK1 residues from the BAK1 mutant, thus disallowing the BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR interaction for unknown reasons. Regardless of the mechanism underlying the pH-dependent BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR interaction, our data suggest that a higher pH may be unfavorable for BR-induced signaling. The plant hormone auxin-dependent acidification of plant cell walls promotes wall extensibility and cell growth14, whereas a hallmark of plant basal immunity is alkalinization (an increase in pH) induced by phytopathogenic bacteria15. It will be interesting to investigate whether the alterations of pH accompanied with auxin treatment and plant immunity has an effect on BR-induced signaling.Given that BAK1 has no BL-binding activity8, their interactions observed in the structure should be dependent on binding of BL to BRI1LRR. Thus, the assembly of a signaling competent BRI1-BL-BAK1 complex is sequential with BL binding to BRI1 first followed by BAK1 specific recognition of the newly BL-created surface via hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions. Connecting BRI1LRR and BAK1LRR by BL, at least partially, contributes to the BL-enhanced BRI1-BAK1 interactions. The hydrogen bonding interactions formed between BL and BAK1LRR may have a critical role in dictating their specific interaction. In keeping with this possibility, many BL derivatives that have a different fused ring portion but retain the two hydroxyl groups are bioactive11. Both the BL- and receptor-mediated BRI1LRR-BAK1LRR interactions appear important for signaling, as supported by the data derived from modifications of the two hydroxyl groups in BL and the BRI1T750I mutation. Therefore, we conclude that BAK1 acts a co-receptor of BRI1. Of note is that during review of our manuscript, a similar conclusion was made for SERK1 based on the crystal structure of BRI1LRR-SERK1LRR16.Detailed methods are described in the Supplementary information, Data S1.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013131"
"cr","Structural basis of PP2A activation by PTPA, an ATP-dependent activation chaperone","Proper activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) catalytic subunit is central for the complex PP2A regulation and is crucial for broad aspects of cellular function. The crystal structure of PP2A bound to PP2A phosphatase activator (PTPA) and ATPγS reveals that PTPA makes broad contacts with the structural elements surrounding the PP2A active site and the adenine moiety of ATP. PTPA-binding stabilizes the protein fold of apo-PP2A required for activation, and orients ATP phosphoryl groups to bind directly to the PP2A active site. This allows ATP to modulate the metal-binding preferences of the PP2A active site and utilize the PP2A active site for ATP hydrolysis. In vitro, ATP selectively and drastically enhances binding of endogenous catalytic metal ions, which requires ATP hydrolysis and is crucial for acquisition of pSer/Thr-specific phosphatase activity. Furthermore, both PP2A- and ATP-binding are required for PTPA function in cell proliferation and survival. Our results suggest novel mechanisms of PTPA in PP2A activation with structural economy and a unique ATP-binding pocket that could potentially serve as a specific therapeutic target.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013138"
"cr","Crystal structure of mammalian cryptochrome in complex with a small molecule competitor of its ubiquitin ligase","The cryptochrome (CRY) flavoproteins are critical components of the mammalian molecular circadian clock, which operates through an auto-regulatory transcription-translation feedback loop1. In this clockwork, a pair of transcription factors, CLOCK and BMAL1, drive the expression of CRYs, Periods (PERs), and other clock-controlled genes, while CRYs and PERs heterodimerize and repress their own gene expression by inhibiting CLOCK-BMAL1-mediated transcription2,3. To establish rhythmic protein oscillation, CRYs are ubiquitinated by the SCFFBXL3 ubiquitin ligase and targeted for rapid proteasomal degradation4,5,6.A recent cell-based screen of small-molecule circadian modulators identified three carbazole derivatives, which are characterized by their common dose-dependent circadian period-lengthening activity7. Further analyses have shown that the representative compound, KL001, acts by directly interacting with CRYs and protecting them from SCFFBXL3-mediated ubiquitination. This pharmacological activity results in CRY stabilization, which lengthens the circadian period.Our recent studies have shown that CRY2-FBXL3 complex formation depends on the insertion of the FBXL3 C-terminal tail into the flavin adenosine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding pocket of the clock protein8. Because FAD can compete with both KL001 and FBXL3 for binding CRYs7, we postulated that KL001 might inhibit CRY ubiquitination by occupying its cofactor pocket and impairing its association with FBXL3. It is, however, equally possible that the small molecule binds at an allosteric site on CRYs.To unravel the binding mode of KL001, we co-purified and crystallized murine CRY2 PHR core domain (1-512) with KL001 and determined the complex structure at 1.94 Å resolution (Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Table S1). In the crystal, CRY2 adopts an overall structure nearly identical to its apo, FAD-bound, and FBXL3-complexed forms8. The largest conformational differences are limited to two local structural elements, namely the phosphate-binding loop and the interface loop (Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Figure S1). KL001 can be readily located in the FAD-binding pocket of CRY2. Clear density is found for the majority of the molecule except its furan moiety, which likely has a flexible conformation (Figure 1B).Figure 1Structure of murine CRY2 in complex with KL001.(A) Overall structure of KL001-bound mCRY2 PHR domain. (B) Three close-up views of KL001 bound to CRY2 with positive Fo-Fc electron density contoured at 3.5 σ and calculated before the compound was built. (C) FAD and KL001 with their functional groups labeled. Subdivisions of the isoalloxazine ring: (1) pyrimidine, (2) pyrazine, (3) xylene.

(E) A comparison of KL001 and FAD bound to CRY2. FAD is modeled onto the KL001-bound CRY2 (ribbon diagram) by CRY2 superposition. Two hydrogen bonds formed between the backbone of FAD-bound CRY2 (line representation) and the pyrimidine moiety of the FAD isoalloxazine ring are shown. (F) A different view of CRY2-bound KL001 in comparison with FAD (line representation) and the C-terminal tail of FBXL3 (teal). (G) Conformation of the ordered phosphate-binding loop of CRY2 with highly conserved but solvent exposed residues. (H) A model of FAD-bound CRY2 with an ordered phosphate-binding loop showing an open cofactor pocket. (I) A structural comparison between KL001-bound murine CRY2 (grey) and Drosophila(6-4)photolyase (dark blue) showing the phosphate-binding loop (pink in CRY2) and its nearby protrusion loop (light blue in CRY2). FAD is modeled in to replace KL001.Full size imageThe CRY2 cofactor pocket can be subdivided into three parts: an inner cleft accommodating the FAD isoalloxazine moiety, an outer crater occupied by the ribitol and ADP moieties of FAD, and an auxiliary cleft, which is empty (Supplementary information, Figure S2). KL001 buries its carbazole ring deep into the inner cleft, indicating that the compound targets the clock protein as a cofactor mimic (Figure 1D). Despite their analogous tricyclic scaffolds (Figure 1C), however, the KL001 carbazole group sterically mimics the outer xylene and central pyrazine moieties of the FAD isoalloxazine ring instead of its entire tricyclic system (Figure 1E). Associated with this lateral shift of the carbazole ring, the rest of KL001 significantly deviates from the FAD cofactor. Instead of interacting with the outer crater, the methanesulfonamide group of KL001 is anchored at an outer vestibule of the FAD-binding pocket, where the FBXL3 C-terminal tail enters in the Skp1-FBXL3-CRY2 structure (Figure 1F and Supplementary information, Figure S2). Overall, the clock-modulating small molecule represents a molecular chimera — one half of it resembles part of the FAD cofactor and the other half sterically imitates the tail of the ubiquitin ligase. Based on previous studies showing that free FAD and point mutations of two inner cleft residues in CRY1, D387N and N393D (D405N and N411D in CRY2, Supplementary information, Figure S3), are each capable of abolishing KL001-CRY1 interaction7, the carbazole moiety of the compound likely plays a determining role in complex formation.By stabilizing CRYs, KL001 has been shown to inhibit glucagon-induced gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes, suggesting a therapeutic potential for diabetes7. The CRY2-KL001 complex structure provides structural basis for further improving its potency. For example, functional groups can be introduced to one end of its carbazole ring to mimic the pyrimidine portion of the FAD isoalloxazine ring, which forms two hydrogen bonds with CRY2 (Figure 1E). Such modifications can be further extended to exploit the nearby auxiliary cleft of the FAD-binding pocket, which is enriched in polar amino acids. Although the methanesulfonamide group of KL001 is already snugly embedded in an induced pocket at the outer vestibule of the cofactor-binding site (Supplementary information, Figure S3), its adjacent flexible furan moiety presents yet another opportunity for compound optimization.Distinct from non-vertebrate cryptochromes and their closely related DNA photolyases, mammalian CRYs feature an open and dynamic FAD-binding pocket characterized by a flexible phosphate-binding loop and a moderate affinity of FAD binding8,9. Unexpectedly, our structure reveals an ordered phosphate-binding loop, which adopts a well-defined conformation in the crystal (Figure 1G). When modeled onto the structure of FAD-bound CRY2, this ordered loop is still well removed from the cofactor (> 5.3 Å) and the FAD-binding pocket remains largely open to the solvent (Figure 1H). By contrast, the same loop in Drosophila (6-4)photolyase, which shares a sequence identity of 53% with CRY2, folds into a lid and traps the cofactor within the pocket as a prosthetic group (Figure 1I)10.Because the phosphate-binding loop is located at the opposite end of the FAD-binding pocket to KL001 (Figure 1G), its ordered structure is likely attributable to crystal packing instead of compound binding. Indeed, crystal analysis shows that the phosphate-binding loop is in close contact with a C-terminal Tyr residue from an adjacent molecule, which approaches the FAD-binding pocket under the loop (Supplementary information, Figure S4). In conjunction with its strictly conserved sequence among vertebrate orthologs (Supplementary information, Figure S5), the structural sensitivity of the phosphate-binding loop to its immediate environment implicates an important role in protein-protein interactions. We speculate that these interactions might increase the affinity of FAD and enable the cofactor to regulate the activity and possibly stability of CRYs, in a manner analogous to the function of the Drosophila cryptochrome C-terminal tail9,11.KL001 is the first-in-class cryptochrome-targeting circadian modulator and substrate-targeting ubiquitination antagonist. The crystal structure of the CRY2-KL001 complex not only reveals its novel mechanism of action as a cofactor-mimicking interfacial inhibitor but also makes further development possible to realize its full therapeutic potential.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013136"
"cr","Driving vascular endothelial cell fate of human multipotent Isl1+ heart progenitors with VEGF modified mRNA","Distinct families of multipotent heart progenitors play a central role in the generation of diverse cardiac, smooth muscle and endothelial cell lineages during mammalian cardiogenesis. The identification of precise paracrine signals that drive the cell-fate decision of these multipotent progenitors, and the development of novel approaches to deliver these signals in vivo, are critical steps towards unlocking their regenerative therapeutic potential. Herein, we have identified a family of human cardiac endothelial intermediates located in outflow tract of the early human fetal hearts (OFT-ECs), characterized by coexpression of Isl1 and CD144/vWF. By comparing angiocrine factors expressed by the human OFT-ECs and non-cardiac ECs, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A was identified as the most abundantly expressed factor, and clonal assays documented its ability to drive endothelial specification of human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived Isl1+ progenitors in a VEGF receptor-dependent manner. Human Isl1-ECs (endothelial cells differentiated from hESC-derived ISL1+ progenitors) resemble OFT-ECs in terms of expression of the cardiac endothelial progenitor- and endocardial cell-specific genes, confirming their organ specificity. To determine whether VEGF-A might serve as an in vivo cell-fate switch for human ESC-derived Isl1-ECs, we established a novel approach using chemically modified mRNA as a platform for transient, yet highly efficient expression of paracrine factors in cardiovascular progenitors. Overexpression of VEGF-A promotes not only the endothelial specification but also engraftment, proliferation and survival (reduced apoptosis) of the human Isl1+ progenitors in vivo. The large-scale derivation of cardiac-specific human Isl1-ECs from human pluripotent stem cells, coupled with the ability to drive endothelial specification, engraftment, and survival following transplantation, suggest a novel strategy for vascular regeneration in the heart.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013112"
"cr","Targeted mutagenesis in rice using CRISPR-Cas system","Genome editing of model organisms is essential for gene function analysis and is thus critical for human health and agricultural production. The current technologies used for genome editing include ZFN (zinc-finger nuclease), meganucleases, TALEN (Transcription activator-like effector nucleases), etc.1. These technologies can generate double stranded breaks (DSBs) to either disrupt gene function through generation of premature stop codons by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, or to facilitate gene targeting through homologous recombination (HR) with an incoming template. Recently, a new technology for genome editing, CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) systems, has been developed2. CRISPR/Cas systems are adaptive defense systems in prokaryotic organisms to fight against alien nucleic acids3. The spacer sequences acquired from foreign DNA are positioned between host repeats, and transcribed together as CRISPR RNA (crRNA). In the type II CRISPR system, a single nuclease Cas9, guided by a dual-crRNA:tracrRNA, is sufficient to cleave cognate DNA homologous to the spacer2. Efficient cleavage also requires the presence of protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) 5′-NGG-3′ following the spacer sequence. The dual-crRNA:tracrRNA has been further streamlined to a single RNA chimera, called sgRNA (single guide RNA)2. Compared with protein-guided technologies, CRISPR/Cas system is much easier to implement, as only short guide RNAs need to be customized to target the genes of interest. Up to now, the CRISPR/Cas system has been successfully applied to efficient genome editing in many eukaryotic organisms including human1, mice4, zebra fish5, fly6, worm7, and yeast8. However, the application of CRISPR/Cas system in plants has not been reported. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a major staple crop in the grass family (Poaceae), feeding half of the world's population. Rice is also used as a model monocot plant for biological studies because it has a relatively small genome compared to other cereal crops and is easy to be manipulated genetically. We demonstrate in this study that the CRISPR/Cas technology can achieve efficient targeted mutagenesis in transgenic rice. Our work paves the way for large-scale genome editing in rice, which is important for quality improvement and yield increase of rice.To accommodate the CRISPR/Cas system to Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation, we designed Gateway™ binary T-DNA vectors for co-expression of CAS9 and guide RNA (either sgRNA or dual-crRNA:tracrRNA, see Figure 1A). Gene-specific spacer sequence was cloned into entry vectors for expression of guide RNA (Supplementary information, Figure S1 and Data S1), which was then cloned into destination vectors containing the CAS9 expression cassette. To reconstitute Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complex in the nucleus, Cas9 was attached with a nuclear localization signal, and guide RNAs were driven by pol III type promoter of U3 snRNA. CAS9 coding sequence was codon-optimized for expression in rice (Supplementary information, Figure S2), and was driven by the maize Ubiquitin (Ubi) promoter. To facilitate Cas9 binding and R-loop formation, we chose the sgRNA with the secondary structure containing a dangling spacer, an extended hairpin region and a long 3′ end (Figure 1B).Figure 1Targeted mutagenesis in rice using CRISPR-Cas system. (A) Schematic diagram of the vectors used in this study. CAS9 is cloned into the destination vector. Guide RNAs are cloned into entry vectors. Modular design of vectors permits multiplex genome editing. (B) Schematic showing the folding of sgRNA and co-folding of crRNA and tracrRNA.

The spacer sequence is shaded in gray, and the PAM is underlined. Sequencing results of mutant alleles are aligned to the reference genome sequence. The indels are shown in red letters or dashes. (I) Tiller angle comparison between WT and transgenic plant.Full size imageTo test whether the CRISPR/Cas system can be applied in plant cells, we first investigated whether the system can generate DSB in rice callus using the DGU.US as a reporter (Supplementary information, Figure S3). GUS activity can be restored through single strand annealing (SSA) upon DNA cleavage between the repeat regions in the DGU.US reporter9 (Figure 1C). We designed both sgRNA and dual-crRNA:tracrRNA to target the reporter. The result showed that strong GUS staining spots were detected in rice calli after the CRISPR/Cas system and the reporter were co-transformed through particle bombardment, whereas no GUS signal was observed in those transformed with the reporter alone (Figure 1D). Both sgRNA and dual-crRNA:tracrRNA were effective in this assay, indicating that pre-crRNA can be properly processed in rice (plant) cells.To further test whether the CRISPR/Cas technology can be used to specifically disrupt an endogenous gene in rice, we designed sgRNAs and dual-crRNA:tracrRNAs targeting either the second exon of the CHLOROPHYLL A OXYGENASE 1 (CAO1) gene or the third exon of the LAZY1 gene, and transformed them into Kitaake, a japonica rice variety with short life cycle10. The seedlings of the loss-of-function mutant cao1 show a pale green leaf phenotype due to defective synthesis of Chlorophyll b (Chl b), which is easily observed at an early developmental stage, whereas the la1 mutant, loss-of-function mutant of LAZY1 gene, exhibited a pronounced tiller-spreading phenotype that can be observed after tillering stage11. We obtained 30 independent transgenic lines for sgRNA construct and 45 lines for dual-crRNA:tracrRNA construct for the CAO1 gene. We found that some transgenic plants displayed pale green leaf blades (Figure 1E), and we conducted genotyping analysis on these lines using gene-specific primers. The result showed that either loss of peak/gain of peak or overlapping peak around the target site was observed in the sequencing chromatograms (Figure 1F and Supplementary information, Figure S4), which confirmed mutations in the CAO1 gene. The occurrence of indels at 3-4-bp upstream of PAM is consistent with the location of Cas9 cleavage site. We randomly selected transgenic lines with biallelic mutation, and measured the contents of Chl a and Chl b12. The result showed that Chl b content was reduced to a marginal level, consistent with the cao1 phenotype (Figure 1G). We obtained only 12 independent transgenic lines for sgRNA construct for LAZY1 gene. Sequencing analysis showed that 11 out of 12 lines bear mutations in the specific region of LAZY1 gene, confirming the disruption of LAZY1 gene (Figure 1H and Supplementary information, Figure S5). Appearance of tiller-spreading phenotypes in 6 homogenous mutation lines further supported the conclusion (Figure 1I). Notably, in the case of sgRNA, about 83.3% and 91.6% of the independent lines of the T1 transgenic rice beared mutations in CAO1 and LAZY1, respectively, among which 4 lines (13.3%) for CAO1 and 6 lines (50%) for LAZY1 beared biallelic mutations (Supplementary information, Table S1). These results indicate that transgenic rice with mutated gene of interest can be easily generated in the T1 generation by using CRISPR/Cas technology, and that the high efficiency of targeted mutagenesis can be achieved in different genes. This high efficiency is possibly due to the unique feature of the CRISPR/Cas system, i.e., different from ZFN or TALEN, Cas9-mediated cleavage tolerates DNA methylation13. This gives the CRISPR/Cas technology leverage for genome editing in plants with high GC content in the genome such as rice. It seems that sgRNA constructs generate targeted mutagenesis more efficiently than dual-crRNA:tracrRNA constructs (Supplementary information, Table S1), the mechanism of which needs to be investigated in the future. To facilitate selection of spacers to target other rice genes, we also used criteria reported recently, which exclude potential mismatches of the first 8 nucleotides of the 20-nt spacer region and leaky activity on 5′-NAG-3′ PAM8, and designed more than 3.6 million spacers (Supplementary information, Data S2).We showed that transgenic rice with mutations in specific genes could be generated through the CRISPR/Cas technology in a straightforward manner. Our strategy for vector construction is modular, efficient, and expandable for multiplex gene editing. Because dual expression of pre-crRNA:tracrRNA can be correctly processed in the plant cells although the mutagenesis efficiency is relatively low in the two genes that we tested (Figure 1 and Supplementary information, Table S1), the entry vectors that we designed has the potential to host two sgRNAs or multiple spacers, in an array of crRNA. The facile genome editing at specific sites in rice will speed up functional characterization of rice genes, especially for those genes with family members, and will greatly promote the effort to improve rice quality and yield through agricultural biotechnology. The compiled list of the specific spacers for each gene in rice genome will also help to accelerate the application of the CRISPR/Cas system in rice. Further work will be focused on whether the CRISPR/Cas system can be applied successfully to other cereals with bigger and more complicated genomes such as maize and wheat. Meanwhile, further modification of the CRISPR/Cas system, e.g., removal of the components of the CRISPR/Cas system after the target genes are mutated, will promote the application of this new technology in agriculture.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013123"
"cr","Multiplexed activation of endogenous genes by CRISPR-on, an RNA-guided transcriptional activator system","Technologies allowing for specific regulation of endogenous genes are valuable for the study of gene functions and have great potential in therapeutics. We created the CRISPR-on system, a two-component transcriptional activator consisting of a nuclease-dead Cas9 (dCas9) protein fused with a transcriptional activation domain and single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with complementary sequence to gene promoters. We demonstrate that CRISPR-on can efficiently activate exogenous reporter genes in both human and mouse cells in a tunable manner. In addition, we show that robust reporter gene activation in vivo can be achieved by injecting the system components into mouse zygotes. Furthermore, we show that CRISPR-on can activate the endogenous IL1RN, SOX2, and OCT4 genes. The most efficient gene activation was achieved by clusters of 3-4 sgRNAs binding to the proximal promoters, suggesting their synergistic action in gene induction. Significantly, when sgRNAs targeting multiple genes were simultaneously introduced into cells, robust multiplexed endogenous gene activation was achieved. Genome-wide expression profiling demonstrated high specificity of the system.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013122"
"cr","MicroRNA-124 mediates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory action through inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines","The vagus nerve can control inflammatory response through a 'cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway', which is mediated by the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR) on macrophages. However, the intracellular mechanisms that link α7nAChR activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production remain not well understood. In this study, we found that miR-124 is upregulated by cholinergic agonists in LPS-exposed cells and mice. Utilizing miR-124 mimic and siRNA knockdown, we demonstrated that miR-124 is a critical mediator for the cholinergic anti-inflammatory action. Furthermore, our data indicated that miR-124 modulates LPS-induced cytokine production by targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to decrease IL-6 production and TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) to reduce TNF-α release. These results also indicate that miR-124 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013116"
"cr","Efficient genome editing in plants using a CRISPR/Cas system","In the past few years, the development of sequence-specific DNA nucleases has progressed rapidly and such nucleases have shown their power in generating efficient targeted mutagenesis and other genome editing applications. For zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), an engineered array of sequence-specific DNA binding domains are fused with the DNA nuclease Fok11,2. These nucleases have been successful in genome modifications by generating double strand breaks (DSBs), which are then repaired through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR) in different species, including mouse, tobacco and rice3,4,5. Recently, another breakthrough technology for genome editing, the CRISPR/Cas system, was developed. CRISPR (clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats) loci are variable short spacers separated by short repeats, which are transcribed into non-coding RNAs. The non-coding RNAs form a functional complex with CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins and guide the complex to cleave complementary invading DNA6. After the initial development of a programmable CRISPR/Cas system, it has been rapidly applied to achieve efficient genome editing in human cell lines, zebrafish and mouse7,8,9,10. However, there is still no successful application in plants reported.We report here that the CRISPR/Cas system can be used to efficiently generate targeted gene mutations and corrections in plants. The Cas9 gene was driven by the CaMV 35S promoter and the chimeric single guide RNA (sgRNA) was driven by the AtU6-26 promoter in Arabidopsis or the OsU6-2 promoter in rice. We show that the engineered CRISPR/Cas was active in creating DSBs when transiently expressed in Arabidopsis protoplasts and stably expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis and rice plants. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using engineered CRISPR/Cas as molecular scissors to create DSBs at specific sites of the plant genome to achieve targeted genome modifications in both dicot and monocot plants.We used the optimized coding sequence of hSpCas99 driven by the CaMV 35S promoter. For the non-coding RNA components of CRISPR, we expressed the sgRNA using native promoters for U6 RNAs in Arabidopsis (Figure 1A and Supplementary information, Figure S1A) or rice (Supplementary information, Figure S1A). The target site precedes an NGG, the requisite protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). To improve co-delivery, both the sgRNA and hSpCas9 were subcloned into one expression vector (Figure 1A). A split yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) reporter system, YF-FP, was used to test the functionality of the engineered CRISPR/Cas system in Arabidopsis protoplasts (Figure 1B). Co-transformation of the YF-FP reporter and the CRISPR/Cas construct led to the production of strong YFP signal with gene correction rate by HR at 18.8% ((4.76%–0.78%)/21.23%) (Figure 1C). The results suggest that the engineered CRISPR/Cas system is highly functional in generating DSBs on target DNA sequences in plant cells and that the DSBs can be repaired by HR to achieve gene correction.Figure 1High-efficiency targeted gene editing in Arabidopsis and rice plants.

The Arabidopsis genes BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1), JASMONATE-ZIM-DOMAIN PROTEIN 1 (JAZ1) and GIBBERELLIC ACID INSENSITIVE (GAI) and the rice genes Rice Outermost Cell-specific gene5 (ROC5), Stromal Processing Peptidase (SPP) and Young Seedling Albino (YSA) were selected for CRISPR/Cas-based disruption (Supplementary information, Figure S1B). These genes were selected owing to obvious growth phenotypes when they are dysfunctional. We designed sgRNAs to target these genes (Supplementary information, Figure S1C). The targets contained restriction enzyme sites close to the PAM sequences, so that the restriction sites may be disrupted when successfully targeted by the CRISPR/Cas (Supplementary information, Figure S2), and RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) analysis can be used to detect mutations in the target region. The vector containing the Cas9 and sgRNA expression cassette was introduced into plants by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using floral dipping in Arabidopsis and tissue culture in rice.More than 50 T1 and 20 T0 transgenic plants were generated for each target in Arabidopsis and rice, respectively (Figure 1D). We observed that a high percentage of the Arabidopsis T1 transgenic plants showed growth phenotypes at a very young stage (one week after transplanting in soil) (Figure 1D). For BRI1, more than 50% plants displayed retarded growth and rolling leaves (Figure 1D and 1E), which are expected for bri1 mutant plants. More than a quarter of the T1 plants for GAI also showed a dwarf phenotype (Figure 1D). At later stages, some continued to exhibit a dwarf phenotype that was similar to bri1 or gai mutant plants (Figure 1F and Supplementary information, Figure S1D). The designed target for GAI is located in the DELLA domain (Supplementary information, Figure S1C), which is important for GA-induced degradation of the GAI protein. It is known that amino acid substitutions or deletions in the DELLA domain of GAI would result in insensitivity to GA-induced degradation, leading to a dwarf phenotype. About 10% of T0 transgenic rice plants targeting YSA showed the expected albino leaf phenotype at the seedling stage (Figure 1D and 1G).We genotyped transgenic plants first by RFLP analysis. Clear undigested bands were observed (Figure 1H and 1I). The failure of restriction enzyme digestion suggested the occurrence of DNA sequence mutations in the target regions. We then sequenced the PCR products to see whether there are additional sequence peaks in the target. Results from the two tests showed that the mutation frequency was very high in both Arabidopsis and rice, ranging from 26% (8 out of 31) to 84% (16 out of 19), except for the SPP sgRNA1 target (5%, 1 out of 21) (Figure 1D).Furthermore, the undigested bands from RFLP analysis were cloned and sequenced. We found that in 24 out of the 27 Arabidopsis T1 transgenic plants and 14 out of the 24 rice T0 transgenic plants subjected to sequencing, there were 2 or more different mutated alleles in one single transgenic plant (Figure 1J–1K, Supplementary information, Tables S1 and S2). These plants all contained mutant alleles with small insertions or deletions (indels) at the target sites (Supplementary information, Figures S3–S11). The presence of multiple mutated alleles in the Arabidopsis transgenic plants indicated that in these plants the CRISPR/Cas did not function or certainly did not complete the genome editing during the fertilization stage, and the editing activity continued after the division of fertilized eggs. Regardless, the high frequency of Arabidopsis T1 transgenic plants showing the expected mutant phenotypes suggests that some of the mutations must have been generated very early in development and possibly in early meristematic cells. Therefore, germ line transmission of some of the mutations into T2 plants is expected for many, if not all, of the T1 plants. The identification of 3 bp deletions (which would result in an amino acid deletion) in 2 out of the 3 GAI sgRNA1 T1 transgenic plants (Supplementary information, Figure S6) could well explain the high-frequency dwarf phenotype observed (Supplementary information, Figure S1D). It is also worth noting that one rice T0 transgenic line for ROC5 sgRNA1 (data not shown) and two each for YSA sgRNA1 (Figure 1I, lane 13 and data not shown) and sgRNA2 (data not shown) showed only mutated alleles and no wild-type allele in the RFLP analysis. Sequencing of individual clones revealed that the plants contained only or mostly mutated alleles (Supplementary information, Table S2, Figures S8, S10, S11). Especially for the ROC5 sgRNA1 and YSA sgRNA1 lines, they contained one or two types of mutated alleles only. Importantly, the YSA sgRNA1 rice plants showed the expected albino leaf phenotype (Figure 1G). The result suggests that these rice plants are likely homozygous or bi-allelic mutants, which implies that in this case the CRISPR/Cas may have completed the generation of DSBs in the first meristematic cell during regeneration of the rice plants from transgenic calli.To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating highly efficient targeted mutagenesis in multiple genes in Arabidopsis and rice using engineered CRISPR/Cas. Although future studies are needed to examine the germ line transmission and heritability of the CRISPR/Cas-induced mutations and to evaluate any potential off-target effects of the CRISPR/Cas, our results here suggest that the CRISPR/Cas technology will make targeted gene editing a routine practice not only in model plants but also in crops.Detailed methods are described in the Supplementary information, Data S1 and Table S3.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013114"
"cr","Intragenic DNA methylation modulates alternative splicing by recruiting MeCP2 to promote exon recognition","Although the function of DNA methylation in gene promoter regions is well established in transcriptional repression, the function of the evolutionarily conserved widespread distribution of DNA methylation in gene body regions remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that DNA methylation is enriched in included alternatively spliced exons (ASEs), and that inhibition of DNA methylation results in aberrant splicing of ASEs. The methyl-CpG-binding protein MeCP2 is enriched in included ASEs, particularly those that are also highly methylated, and inhibition of DNA methylation disrupts specific targeting of MeCP2 to exons. Interestingly, ablation of MeCP2 results in increased histone acetylation and aberrant ASE-skipping events. We further show that inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity leads to exon skipping that shows a highly significant degree of overlap with that caused by MeCP2 knockdown. Together, our data indicate that intragenic DNA methylation operates in exon definition to modulate alternative RNA splicing and can enhance exon recognition via recruitment of the multifunctional protein MeCP2, which thereby maintains local histone hypoacetylation through the subsequent recruitment of HDACs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013110"
"cr","Genome analysis and signature discovery for diving and sensory properties of the endangered Chinese alligator","Crocodilians are diving reptiles that can hold their breath under water for long periods of time and are crepuscular animals with excellent sensory abilities. They comprise a sister lineage of birds and have no sex chromosome. Here we report the genome sequence of the endangered Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis) and describe its unique features. The next-generation sequencing generated 314 Gb of raw sequence, yielding a genome size of 2.3 Gb. A total of 22 200 genes were predicted in Alligator sinensis using a de novo, homology- and RNA-based combined model. The genetic basis of long-diving behavior includes duplication of the bicarbonate-binding hemoglobin gene, co-functioning of routine phosphate-binding and special bicarbonate-binding oxygen transport, and positively selected energy metabolism, ammonium bicarbonate excretion and cardiac muscle contraction. Further, we elucidated the robust Alligator sinensis sensory system, including a significantly expanded olfactory receptor repertoire, rapidly evolving nerve-related cellular components and visual perception, and positive selection of the night vision-related opsin and sound detection-associated otopetrin. We also discovered a well-developed immune system with a considerable number of lineage-specific antigen-presentation genes for adaptive immunity as well as expansion of the tripartite motif-containing C-type lectin and butyrophilin genes for innate immunity and expression of antibacterial peptides. Multifluorescence in situ hybridization showed that alligator chromosome 3, which encodes DMRT1, exhibits significant synteny with chicken chromosome Z. Finally, population history analysis indicated population admixture 0.60-1.05 million years ago, when the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau was uplifted.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2013104"
"cr","Generation of haploid embryonic stem cells from Macaca fascicularis monkey parthenotes","Recent success in the derivation of haploid embryonic stem cells (haESCs) from mouse via parthenogenesis and androgenesis has enabled genetic screening in mammalian cells and generation of gene-modified animals. However, whether haESCs can be derived from primates remains unknown. Here, we report the derivation of haESCs from parthenogenetic blastocysts of Macaca fascicularis monkeys. These cells, termed as PG-haESCs, are pluripotent and can differentiate to cells of three embryonic germ layers in vitro or in vivo. Interestingly, the haploidy of one monkey PG-haESC line (MPH1) is more stable compared with that of the other one (MPH2), as shown by the existence of haploid cells for more than 140 days without fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) enrichment of haploid cells. Importantly, transgenic monkey PG-haESC lines can be generated by lentivirus- and piggyBac transposon-mediated gene transfer. Moreover, genetic screening is feasible in monkey PG-haESCs. Our results demonstrate that PG-haESCs can be generated from monkeys, providing an ideal tool for genetic analyses in primates.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201393"
"cr","Structure of MERS-CoV spike receptor-binding domain complexed with human receptor DPP4","The spike glycoprotein (S) of recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) targets the cellular receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Sequence comparison and modeling analysis have revealed a putative receptor-binding domain (RBD) on the viral spike, which mediates this interaction. We report the 3.0 Å-resolution crystal structure of MERS-CoV RBD bound to the extracellular domain of human DPP4. Our results show that MERS-CoV RBD consists of a core and a receptor-binding subdomain. The receptor-binding subdomain interacts with DPP4 β-propeller but not its intrinsic hydrolase domain. MERS-CoV RBD and related SARS-CoV RBD share a high degree of structural similarity in their core subdomains, but are notably divergent in the receptor-binding subdomain. Mutagenesis studies have identified several key residues in the receptor-binding subdomain that are critical for viral binding to DPP4 and entry into the target cell. The atomic details at the interface between MERS-CoV RBD and DPP4 provide structural understanding of the virus and receptor interaction, which can guide development of therapeutics and vaccines against MERS-CoV infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201392"
"cr","An ABA-mimicking ligand that reduces water loss and promotes drought resistance in plants","Abscisic acid (ABA) is the most important hormone for plants to resist drought and other abiotic stresses. ABA binds directly to the PYR/PYL family of ABA receptors, resulting in inhibition of type 2C phosphatases (PP2C) and activation of downstream ABA signaling. It is envisioned that intervention of ABA signaling by small molecules could help plants to overcome abiotic stresses such as drought, cold and soil salinity. However, chemical instability and rapid catabolism by plant enzymes limit the practical application of ABA itself. Here we report the identification of a small molecule ABA mimic (AM1) that acts as a potent activator of multiple members of the family of ABA receptors. In Arabidopsis, AM1 activates a gene network that is highly similar to that induced by ABA. Treatments with AM1 inhibit seed germination, prevent leaf water loss, and promote drought resistance. We solved the crystal structure of AM1 in complex with the PYL2 ABA receptor and the HAB1 PP2C, which revealed that AM1 mediates a gate-latch-lock interacting network, a structural feature that is conserved in the ABA-bound receptor/PP2C complex. Together, these results demonstrate that a single small molecule ABA mimic can activate multiple ABA receptors and protect plants from water loss and drought stress. Moreover, the AM1 complex crystal structure provides a structural basis for designing the next generation of ABA-mimicking small molecules.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201395"
"cr","Production of ACAT1 56-kDa isoform in human cells via trans-splicing involving the ampicillin resistance gene","Trans-splicing, a process involving the cleavage and joining of two separate transcripts, can expand the transcriptome and proteome in eukaryotes. Chimeric RNAs generated by trans-splicing are increasingly described in literatures. The widespread presence of antibiotic resistance genes in natural environments and human intestines is becoming an important challenge for public health. Certain antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampicillin resistance gene (Ampr), are frequently used in recombinant plasmids. Until now, trans-splicing involving recombinant plasmid-derived exogenous transcripts and endogenous cellular RNAs has not been reported. Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1) is a key enzyme involved in cellular cholesterol homeostasis. The 4.3-kb human ACAT1 chimeric mRNA can produce 50-kDa and 56-kDa isoforms with different enzymatic activities. Here, we show that human ACAT1 56-kDa isoform is produced from an mRNA species generated through the trans-splicing of an exogenous transcript encoded by the antisense strand of Ampr (asAmp) present in common Ampr-plasmids and the 4.3-kb endogenous ACAT1 chimeric mRNA, which is presumably processed through a prior event of interchromosomal trans-splicing. Strikingly, DNA fragments containing the asAmp with an upstream recombined cryptic promoter and the corresponding exogenous asAmp transcripts have been detected in human cells. Our findings shed lights on the mechanism of human ACAT1 56-kDa isoform production, reveal an exogenous-endogenous trans-splicing system, in which recombinant plasmid-derived exogenous transcripts are linked with endogenous cellular RNAs in human cells, and suggest that exogenous DNA might affect human gene expression at both DNA and RNA levels.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201386"
"cr","Mlkl knockout mice demonstrate the indispensable role of Mlkl in necroptosis","Mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (Mlkl) was recently found to interact with receptor interacting protein 3 (Rip3) and to be essential for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced programmed necrosis (necroptosis) in cultured cell lines. We have generated Mlkl-deficient mice by transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs)-mediated gene disruption and found Mlkl to be dispensable for normal mouse development as well as immune cell development. Mlkl-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and macrophages both showed resistance to necrotic but not apoptotic stimuli. Mlkl-deficient MEFs and macrophages were indistinguishable from wild-type cells in their ability to activate NF-κB, ERK, JNK, and p38 in response to TNF and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), respectively. Consistently, Mlkl-deficient macrophages and mice exhibited normal interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and TNF production after LPS treatment. Mlkl deficiency protects mice from cerulean-induced acute pancreatitis, a necrosis-related disease, but has no effect on polymicrobial septic shock-induced animal death. Our results provide genetic evidence for the role of Mlkl in necroptosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201391"
"cr","The gating charge pathway of an epilepsy-associated potassium channel accommodates chemical ligands","Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels derive their voltage sensitivity from movement of gating charges in voltage-sensor domains (VSDs). The gating charges translocate through a physical pathway in the VSD to open or close the channel. Previous studies showed that the gating charge pathways of Shaker and Kv1.2-2.1 chimeric channels are occluded, forming the structural basis for the focused electric field and gating charge transfer center. Here, we show that the gating charge pathway of the voltage-gated KCNQ2 potassium channel, activity reduction of which causes epilepsy, can accommodate various small molecule ligands. Combining mutagenesis, molecular simulation and electrophysiological recording, a binding model for the probe activator, ztz240, in the gating charge pathway was defined. This information was used to establish a docking-based virtual screening assay targeting the defined ligand-binding pocket. Nine activators with five new chemotypes were identified, and in vivo experiments showed that three ligands binding to the gating charge pathway exhibit significant anti-epilepsy activity. Identification of various novel activators by virtual screening targeting the pocket supports the presence of a ligand-binding site in the gating charge pathway. The capability of the gating charge pathway to accommodate small molecule ligands offers new insights into the gating charge pathway of the therapeutically relevant KCNQ2 channel.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201382"
"cr","Subepicardial endothelial cells invade the embryonic ventricle wall to form coronary arteries","Coronary arteries bring blood flow to the heart muscle. Understanding the developmental program of the coronary arteries provides insights into the treatment of coronary artery diseases. Multiple sources have been described as contributing to coronary arteries including the proepicardium, sinus venosus (SV), and endocardium. However, the developmental origins of coronary vessels are still under intense study. We have produced a new genetic tool for studying coronary development, an AplnCreER mouse line, which expresses an inducible Cre recombinase specifically in developing coronary vessels. Quantitative analysis of coronary development and timed induction of AplnCreER fate tracing showed that the progenies of subepicardial endothelial cells (ECs) both invade the compact myocardium to form coronary arteries and remain on the surface to produce veins. We found that these subepicardial ECs are the major sources of intramyocardial coronary vessels in the developing heart. In vitro explant assays indicate that the majority of these subepicardial ECs arise from endocardium of the SV and atrium, but not from ventricular endocardium. Clonal analysis of Apln-positive cells indicates that a single subepicardial EC contributes equally to both coronary arteries and veins. Collectively, these data suggested that subepicardial ECs are the major source of intramyocardial coronary arteries in the ventricle wall, and that coronary arteries and veins have a common origin in the developing heart.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201383"
"cr","ROS play a critical role in the differentiation of alternatively activated macrophages and the occurrence of tumor-associated macrophages","Differentiation to different types of macrophages determines their distinct functions. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote tumorigenesis owing to their proangiogenic and immune-suppressive functions similar to those of alternatively activated (M2) macrophages. We report that reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is critical for macrophage differentiation and that inhibition of superoxide (O2−) production specifically blocks the differentiation of M2 macrophages. We found that when monocytes are triggered to differentiate, O2− is generated and is needed for the biphasic ERK activation, which is critical for macrophage differentiation. We demonstrated that ROS elimination by butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and other ROS inhibitors blocks macrophage differentiation. However, the inhibitory effect of ROS elimination on macrophage differentiation is overcome when cells are polarized to classically activated (M1), but not M2, macrophages. More importantly, the continuous administration of the ROS inhibitor BHA efficiently blocked the occurrence of TAMs and markedly suppressed tumorigenesis in mouse cancer models. Targeting TAMs by blocking ROS can be a potentially effective method for cancer treatment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201375"
"cr","Structure of the Ca2+-dependent PP2A heterotrimer and insights into Cdc6 dephosphorylation","The B″/PR72 family of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is an important PP2A family involved in diverse cellular processes, and uniquely regulated by calcium binding to the regulatory subunit. The PR70 subunit in this family interacts with cell division control 6 (Cdc6), a cell cycle regulator important for control of DNA replication. Here, we report crystal structures of the isolated PR72 and the trimeric PR70 holoenzyme at a resolution of 2.1 and 2.4 Å, respectively, and in vitro characterization of Cdc6 dephosphorylation. The holoenzyme structure reveals that one of the PR70 calcium-binding motifs directly contacts the scaffold subunit, resulting in the most compact scaffold subunit conformation among all PP2A holoenzymes. PR70 also binds distinctively to the catalytic subunit near the active site, which is required for PR70 to enhance phosphatase activity toward Cdc6. Our studies provide a structural basis for unique regulation of B″/PR72 holoenzymes by calcium ions, and suggest the mechanisms for precise control of substrate specificity among PP2A holoenzymes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201377"
"cr","Restrictions to HIV-1 replication in resting CD4+ T lymphocytes","CD4+ T lymphocytes represent the main target cell population of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In an activated state, CD4+ T cells residing in lymphoid organs are a major reservoir of ongoing HIV-1 replication in infected individuals. In contrast, resting CD4+ T cells are highly resistant to productive HIV-1 infection, yet are massively depleted during disease progression and represent a substantial latent reservoir for the virus in vivo. Barriers preventing replication of HIV-1 in resting CD4+ T cells include a rigid layer of cortical actin and, early after HIV-1 entry, a block that limits reverse transcription of incoming viral RNA genomes. Defining the molecular bases of these restrictions has remained one of the central open questions in HIV research. Recent advances unraveled mechanisms by which HIV-1 bypasses the entry block and established the host cell restriction factor SAMHD1, a deoxynucleoside triphosphate triphosphohydrolase, as a central determinant of the cellular restriction to HIV-1 reverse transcription in resting CD4+ T cells. This review summarizes our current molecular and pathophysiological understanding of the multi-faceted interactions of HIV-1 with resting CD4+ T lymphocytes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201374"
"cr","Sirtuin deacetylases in neurodegenerative diseases of aging","Sirtuin enzymes are a family of highly conserved protein deacetylases that depend on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) for their activity. There are seven sirtuins in mammals and these proteins have been linked with caloric restriction and aging by modulating energy metabolism, genomic stability and stress resistance. Sirtuin enzymes are potential therapeutic targets in a variety of human diseases including cancer, diabetes, inflammatory disorders and neurodegenerative disease. Modulation of sirtuin activity has been shown to impact the course of several aggregate-forming neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Sirtuins can influence the progression of neurodegenerative disorders by modulating transcription factor activity and directly deacetylating proteotoxic species. Here, we describe sirtuin protein targets in several aggregate-forming neurodegenerative diseases and discuss the therapeutic potential of compounds that modulate sirtuin activity in these disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201370"
"cr","ALDH2 protects against stroke by clearing 4-HNE","Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is a mitochondrial enzyme that metabolizes ethanol and toxic aldehydes such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). Using an unbiased proteomic search, we identified ALDH2 deficiency in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP) as compared with spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). We concluded the causative role of ALDH2 deficiency in neuronal injury as overexpression or activation of ALDH2 conferred neuroprotection by clearing 4-HNE in in vitro studies. Further, ALDH2-knockdown rats revealed the absence of neuroprotective effects of PKCε. Moderate ethanol administration that is known to exert protection against stroke was shown to enhance the detoxification of 4-HNE, and to protect against ischemic cerebral injury through the PKCε-ALDH2 pathway. In SHR-SP, serum 4-HNE level was persistently elevated and correlated inversely with the lifespan. The role of 4-HNE in stroke in humans was also suggested by persistent elevation of its plasma levels for at least 6 months after stroke. Lastly, we observed that 21 of 1 242 subjects followed for 8 years who developed stroke had higher initial plasma 4-HNE levels than those who did not develop stroke. These findings suggest that activation of the ALDH2 pathway may serve as a useful index in the identification of stroke-prone subjects, and the ALDH2 pathway may be a potential target of therapeutic intervention in stroke.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201369"
"cr","Structural analyses of Legionella LepB reveal a new GAP fold that catalytically mimics eukaryotic RasGAP","Rab GTPases are emerging targets of diverse bacterial pathogens. Here, we perform biochemical and structural analyses of LepB, a Rab GTPase-activating protein (GAP) effector from Legionella pneumophila. We map LepB GAP domain to residues 313-618 and show that the GAP domain is Rab1 specific with a catalytic activity higher than the canonical eukaryotic TBC GAP and the newly identified VirA/EspG family of bacterial RabGAP effectors. Exhaustive mutation analyses identify Arg444 as the arginine finger, but no catalytically essential glutamine residues. Crystal structures of LepB313-618 alone and the GAP domain of Legionella drancourtii LepB in complex with Rab1-GDP-AlF3 support the catalytic role of Arg444, and also further reveal a 3D architecture and a GTPase-binding mode distinct from all known GAPs. Glu449, structurally equivalent to TBC RabGAP glutamine finger in apo-LepB, undergoes a drastic movement upon Rab1 binding, which induces Rab1 Gln70 side-chain flipping towards GDP-AlF3 through a strong ionic interaction. This conformationally rearranged Gln70 acts as the catalytic cis-glutamine, therefore uncovering an unexpected RasGAP-like catalytic mechanism for LepB. Our studies highlight an extraordinary structural and catalytic diversity of RabGAPs, particularly those from bacterial pathogens.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201354"

However, the applicability and efficiency of this system in model organisms, such as zebrafish, are little studied. Here, we report that RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease efficiently facilitates genome editing in both mammalian cells and zebrafish embryos in a simple and robust manner. Over 35% of site-specific somatic mutations were found when specific Cas/gRNA was used to target either etsrp, gata4 or gata5 in zebrafish embryos in vivo. The Cas9/gRNA efficiently induced biallelic conversion of etsrp or gata5 in the resulting somatic cells, recapitulating their respective vessel phenotypes in etsrpy11 mutant embryos or cardia bifida phenotypes in fautm236a mutant embryos. Finally, we successfully achieved site-specific insertion of mloxP sequence induced by Cas9/gRNA system in zebrafish embryos. These results demonstrate that the Cas9/gRNA system has the potential of becoming a simple, robust and efficient reverse genetic tool for zebrafish and other model organisms. Together with other genome-engineering technologies, the Cas9 system is promising for applications in biology, agriculture, environmental studies and medicine.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201345"

Each individual SCF E3 ligase consists of one adaptor protein SKP1, one scaffold protein cullin-1 (the first family member of the eight cullins), one F-box protein out of 69 family members, and one out of two RING (Really Interesting New Gene) family proteins RBX1/ROC1 or RBX2/ROC2/SAG/RNF7. Various combinations of these four components construct a large number of SCF E3s that promote the degradation of many key regulatory proteins in cell-context, temporally, and spatially dependent manners, thus controlling precisely numerous important cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, apoptosis, gene transcription, signal transduction, DNA replication, maintenance of genome integrity, and tumorigenesis. To understand how the SCF E3 ligases regulate these cellular processes and embryonic development under in vivo physiological conditions, a number of mouse models with transgenic (Tg) expression or targeted deletion of components of SCF have been established and characterized. In this review, we will provide a brief introduction to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases, followed by a comprehensive overview on the existing Tg and knockout (KO) mouse models of the SCF E3s, and discuss the role of each component in mouse embryogenesis, cell proliferation, apoptosis, carcinogenesis, as well as other pathogenic processes associated with human diseases. We will end with a brief discussion on the future directions of this research area and the potential applications of the knowledge gained to more effective therapeutic interventions of human diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201344"
"cr","Dynamics of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine during germ cell reprogramming","Previous studies have revealed that mouse primordial germ cells (PGCs) undergo genome-wide DNA methylation reprogramming to reset the epigenome for totipotency. However, the precise 5-methylcytosine (5mC) dynamics and its relationship with the generation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) are not clear. Here we analyzed the dynamics of 5mC and 5hmC during PGC reprograming and germ cell development. Unexpectedly, we found a specific period (E8.5-9.5) during which both 5mC and 5hmC levels are low. Subsequently, 5hmC levels increase reaching its peak at E11.5 and gradually decrease until E13.5 likely by replication-dependent dilution. Interestingly, 5hmC is enriched in chromocenters during this period. While this germ cell-specific 5hmC subnuclear localization pattern is maintained in female germ cells even in mature oocytes, such pattern is gradually lost in male germ cells as mitotic proliferation resumes during the neonatal stage. Pericentric 5hmC plays an important role in silencing major satellite repeat, especially in female PGCs. Global transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq revealed that the great majority of differentially expressed genes from E9.5 to 13.5 are upregulated in both male and female PGCs. Although only female PGCs enter meiosis during the prenatal stage, meiosis-related and a subset of imprinted genes are significantly upregulated in both male and female PGCs at E13.5. Thus, our study not only reveals the dynamics of 5mC and 5hmC during PGC reprogramming and germ cell development, but also their potential role in epigenetic reprogramming and transcriptional regulation of meiotic and imprinted genes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201322"
"cr","Crystal structures of two phytohormone signal-transducing α/β hydrolases: karrikin-signaling KAI2 and strigolactone-signaling DWARF14","Karrikins and strigolactones (SL) are two classes of butenolide compounds that control many aspects of plant physiology. Karrikins, originally found in the smoke of forest fires, have the ability to stimulate seed germination1. SL are endogenous plant hormones that mediate responses to low levels of soil nutrients, such as phosphate and nitrate2. They promote root branching to increase nutrient uptake while inhibiting shoot branching to reduce nutrient demand. SL are also secreted from roots to stimulate symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi for increased nutrient uptake, signals that are exploited to induce seed germination in parasitic weeds, including Striga and Orobanche, which are major causes of crop losses2.Genetic studies in Arabidopsis have identified KAI2 and MAX2 as two key players in karrikin signal transduction3. KAI2 has high sequence similarity to the bacterial signaling protein RbsQ4 (Supplementary information, Figure S1), which encodes an α/β hydrolase. MAX2 is the F-box component of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase. SL signaling is also mediated by MAX2 and by a paralog of KAI2, D142. Moreover, a D14 homolog from petunia, DAD2, has hydrolytic activity toward the synthetic SL, GR24, and this activity has been proposed to be essential for SL perception5. Similarly, hydrolysis of the butenolide moiety of karrikins by KAI2 has been proposed as a part of the karrikin signaling mechanism6. However, the mechanisms of catalysis as well as the molecular bases of the signaling specificity of KAI2 and D14 toward karrikins and SL remain unclear.To further understand their functions, we crystallized KAI2 and D14 proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtKAI2 and AtD14) and D14 from rice, Oryza sativa (OsD14), and determined their structures (see Supplementary information, Data S1 and Table S1). The overall structures confirm that they are members of the α/β hydrolase superfamily. All 3 structures share a common fold of a seven-stranded β-sheet (β2-β8) surrounded by five helices (α0, αB-αE) at one side and two (αA and αF) at the other, and a top domain displaying a double layer V-shaped helical fold containing four helices (αT1-αT4) that harbor a substrate-binding pocket (Figure 1A). The two D14 structures are almost superimposable, as well as the recently solved structure of petunia DAD25 (Supplementary information, Figure S3; rmsd < 0.85 Å), confirming that all three proteins are D14 orthologs.Figure 1Structures and activities of KAI2 and D14 proteins.

The triad serine residue of hydrolases functions as highly reactive nucleophile that binds to and hydrolyzes substrates, while the histidine and aspartate residues form a charge relay network to increase the nucleophilicity of the serine and to function as acceptor of the serine hydroxyl proton.Molecular docking of karrikins into the KAI2 pocket (Figure 1B, 1C and Supplementary information, Figure S2) and of GR24 into the AtD14 pocket (Figure 1B) indicated a snug fit of these compounds in pockets lined by bulky aromatic side chains. The lactone carboxyl groups of the docked karrikin and SL are in close proximity to the hydroxyl groups of the triad serine residues (2.9 Å and 2.5 Å, respectively) to allow a nucleophilic attack, supported by the histidine and aspartate charge relay network, that would result in the hydrolysis of the butenolide rings (Figure 1B, 1C and Supplementary information, Figure S4). Ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) combined with ES-MS confirmed the hydrolysis of the GR24 butenolide ring and identified the GR24 ABC-ring and lactone D-ring as final hydrolysis products (Supplementary information, Figures S4 and S6).When we tried to co-crystallize OsD14 with GR24, we obtained the crystal structure of D14 covalently bound to a GR24 degradation intermediate, 2,4,4,-trihydroxy-3-methyl-3-butenal, which is clearly revealed by the electron density map (Supplementary information, Figure S4A-S4C). The transition state captured in this structure shows the hydroxyl group of S97 attached to C1 of the intermediate, which is further stabilized by water-mediated hydrogen bonds with H247 and Y159 (Supplementary information, Figure S4B). This intermediate suggests that the initial nucleophilic attack causes an electron shift, followed by the addition of a water molecule, to lead to the release of the ABC ring product and the formation of a S97-stabilized open lactone. The latter then converts to the intermediate found in the crystal structure by 1,4-addition of a water molecule to the two conjugated double bonds. The C1 enol tautomer of the transition product can then undergo an intra-molecular Michael addition of the C1 hydroxyl to the carbonyl group at position 4 to form the final closed lactone ring (Supplementary information, Figure S4D) identified by MS (Supplementary information, Figure S6).Despite that KAI2 has high sequence and structure similarity to the two D14 proteins (Supplementary information, Figure S1), KAI2 is not able to mediate the strigolactone branching signaling, and the D14 proteins do not promote seed germination in response to karrikin exposure7. While the overall structures of these hydrolases are very similar (rmsd ≤ 1.15 Å), their substrate binding pockets differ significantly. KAI2 has a relatively small pocket of 279 Å3 compared to the larger pockets of AtD14 (357 Å3) and OsD14 (432 Å3). In addition, the pocket of KAI2 is constricted in the middle by the inward shift of helix αT4, whose bulky residues I193 (V194 in both D14 proteins) and F194 face into the pocket (Figure 1B, 1D). Overlay of the apo structures of KAI2 and D14 indicates that these two residues of KAI2 would clash with the position of GR24 as docked into the D14 binding pocket. Conversely, the larger binding pocket of the D14 proteins cannot accommodate karrikin as docked into the KAI2 pocket because the KAI2 ligand-binding residue F157 is replaced with a tyrosine in D14, whose hydroxyl group clashes with the oxygen atom of the 6-member pyran ring of karrikin (Figure 1D). Therefore, the positions of 3 bulky hydrophobic residues, I193/IV194, F194/F195, and F157/Y159 are likely the main determinants of ligand specificity.To biochemically assess hydrolase activity and specificity, we first determined the activities of KAI2 and the D14 proteins towards a small generic hydrolase substrate, 4-nitrophenyl butyrate, and compared them to the activity of SABP2, a methyl salicylate-cleaving α/β hydrolase involved in systemic acquired resistance signaling8,9. Our biochemical assays demonstrated that SABP2 is able to hydrolyze 4-nitrophenyl butyrate, and its enzymatic activity can be entirely blocked by PMSF, a commonly used hydrolase inhibitor (Figure 1E). Despite the structural similarity to SABP2, KAI2 and D14 do not show significant esterase activity for 4-nitrophenyl butyrate, either in the presence or absence of PMSF, and the low activity of KAI2 and D14 are not inhibited by PMSF (Figure 1E). The crystal structure of SABP2 in complex with salicylic acid8 revealed a small binding pocket of 167 Å3, whose entrance is covered by a cap domain (Supplementary information, Figure S5), which can enhance the capture of the substrate during catalysis. In contrast, both KAI2 and D14 have a rigid open entrance to their substrate binding pockets where a bound substrate can leave before being hydrolyzed, which may explain why KAI2 and D14 have much lower activity than SABP2. In contrast to the activities toward 4-nitrophenyl butyrate, only the D14 proteins were able to hydrolyze GR24, demonstrating hormone substrate specificity for this class of signaling hydrolases. However, the GR24 hydrolase activity is extremely low, with a turnover rate of only one GR24 molecule per D14 molecule per three minutes.D14 and KAI2 are absolutely required for SL and karrikin signaling, respectively, and are functionally linked to the same F-box protein, AtMAX2/OsD3. This pathway is reminiscent of gibberellin signal perception and transduction, in which the catalytically inactive α/β-hydrolase GID1 functions as the hormone receptor to mediate hormone-dependent complex formation between GID1, DELLA transcriptional repressors that function as coreceptors, and the GID2 F-box protein10,11,12. F-box-binding mediated degradation of the DELLA repressors leads then to induction of gibberellin-responsive genes. While SL and karrikins might be precursors of the actual signaling molecules, thought to be generated by D14- and KAI2-catalyzed hydrolysis, the extremely low hydrolase activity and the apparent lack of signaling activity of GR24 hydrolytic products5 suggest that D14 and KAI2 may instead function as hormone receptors in analogy to GID1. Moreover, while endogenous SL occur at low concentrations, D14 alone exhibits only weak substrate-binding affinity, consistent with a possible coreceptor requirement for high-affinity binding. We speculate that D14 and KAI2, which unlike SABP2 lack moveable lids to control access to the ligand-binding pocket, likely associate with coreceptors in the ligand-bound state to retain the ligands in the pocket, thereby increasing ligand/substrate affinity. In analogy with GID1, and consistent with a GR24-mediated Y2H interaction between petunia D14 and MAX25, a ternary receptor-hormone-coreceptor complex might recruit SCFD3/MAX2 for coreceptor ubiquitination and degradation. Association and possible degradation of SL- and karrikin-specific corepressors would therefore provide a simple explanation for D14 and KAI2 signaling through the same F-box protein.In summary, the structures reported in this study revealed unique pocket topologies as a basis for karrikin and SL signaling specificities, identified the pathway and mechanism of D14-catalyzed GR24 hydrolysis, and further support the likely roles of KAI2 and D14 in karrikin and SL perception.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201319"
"cr","A proposed role for glutamine in cancer cell growth through acid resistance","Cancer cells exhibit a greatly increased level of aerobic glycolysis with accumulation of lactic acid, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect. Apparently, survival of cancer cells requires an elaborate system for acid resistance. L-glutamine (Gln) has long been known to be essential for cancer cell growth, which is generally thought to relate to the nutritional value of Gln as carbon and nitrogen source. On the basis of our recent finding that Gln provides acid resistance for E. coli through release of ammonia, we hypothesized that the primary role of Gln in cancer cells is to fight acid, rather than provide nutrition, through enzymatic deamidation. In this letter, we provide preliminary experimental evidence that supports this hypothesis. We demonstrate that Gln helps cancer cells survive acidic stress, which is compromised by inhibition of specific glutaminase activity. Our data suggests that glutaminase inhibitors, currently under clinical trials as an anti-cancer drug, may work by countering the ability of cancer cells to survive under acidic environment. We further speculate that the general requirement of Gln in cell culture is also due to its crucial role in acid resistance.A hallmark of cancer cell is described as the Warburg Effect, with increased aerobic glycolysis and reduced oxidative phosphorylation1. Even in the presence of oxygen, cancer cells convert glucose mainly into lactic acid, which, with a pK of 3.7, contributes to an acidic environment in tumor2. The extracellular pH value of human cancer tissues can be as low as 5.63. As numerous biological reactions are strictly pH dependent, lowered pH value may be detrimental to cancer cell growth. Consequently, cancer cells must be able to efficiently neutralize lactic acid to ensure normal growth. Supporting this analysis, the intracellular pH in tumors was reported to remain largely unchanged even when the extracellular pH value precipitously dropped as a consequence of cell growth4. This observation suggests presence of a robust acid resistance system within cancer cells. Much to our surprise, there is little description or research into the acid resistance system in cancer cells.L-glutamine (Gln) is the most abundant free amino acid in human body5, with its concentration higher than that of all other 19 amino acids combined. Gln is also the most abundant free amino acid in a large variety of food sources, including meat and vegetables6. Remarkably, cancer cells heavily depend on Gln for growth and proliferation5, and glutamine deprivation in cell culture leads to rapid loss of cell viability7. Strikingly, most tumor cells consume Gln at a much higher rate compared to normal cells8. The prevailing view is that Gln provides carbon and nitrogen source for cell growth, as Gln is converted into L-glutamate (Glu) and ammonia through glutaminolysis9. Unfortunately, this common belief is contradicted by the experimental observation that, despite efficient transport systems for Glu and ammonium, Glu at any concentration, even if supplemented by NH4+ and ATP, failed to permit the growth of L-fibroblast7. Thus, we believe that the question of why Gln is required for cancer cell growth and more generally cell culture remains largely enigmatic.In the accompanying paper6, we report a novel bacterial acid resistance system, which relies on the release of ammonia from Gln via the enzymatic activity of glutaminases. The released ammonia neutralizes the acid in E. coli. This finding, together with the use of ammonia by Helicobactor polari to fight acid in the stomach10, motivated us to hypothesize an important role for Gln in cancer cell growth. In this hypothesis, Gln is thought to facilitate cancer cell growth not just by providing carbon and nitrogen source, but more importantly, by fighting acidic stress through enzymatic release of ammonia. Our proposed hypothesis is consistent with a body of existing literatures and knowledge. Two different glutaminases (GLS) have been identified in mammalian cells: GLS1 (with two splice forms KGA and GAC11,12), which is mainly expressed in the kidney, and GLS2 (also called LGA13), which exists mainly in the liver. The mRNA levels of GAC have been found to be elevated in various tumors12. In fact, GAC was shown to be essential for the growth of non-small cell lung cancer14. Glutaminase inhibitors have been under clinical trials in the United States as a potential anti-cancer therapy15. It should be noted, however, these previous studies did not link the important role of glutaminase to the requirement of Gln in acid resistance for cancer cell growth.To help validate this hypothesis, we studied the impact of Gln in cell growth using HeLa and MCF-7 cells, derived from cervical and breast cancers, respectively. In this letter, we report that, as cells grow, the extracellular environment becomes increasingly acidic, and continued cell growth requires Gln. In culture medium of lower pH, cancer cells consumed more Gln, with more Glu accumulated in the extracellular environment. The pro-survival role of Gln under acidic pH is sabotaged by specific glutaminase inhibitor. These data collectively support the hypothesis of an essential role for Gln in cancer cell growth under acidic stress. Our preliminary experimental evidence is briefly outlined below.First, we show that cancer cell lines appear to depend on Gln to maintain normal growth. HeLa and MCF-7 cells were cultured following manufacturer's protocol but with provision of varying concentrations of Gln (0, 5, 10, and 25 mM); cell density was measured at 0, 8, 16, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. There is a strong correlation between cell growth and the presence of Gln (Supplementary information, Figure S1). In the presence of 5 mM or higher concentrations of Gln, the growth curves appear qualitatively the same for HeLa or MCF-7 cells. By contrast, the HeLa or MCF7 cell density was considerably lower in the absence of Gln (Supplementary information, Figure S1). Reduced levels of Gln also gave rise to reduced rate of growth for HeLa and MCF-7 cells (Supplementary information, Figure S2).Next, we measured the pH values of the culture medium at different time points. Consistent with the notion that cell growth results in acidification of the culture medium, the pH decreased over time for both cell lines (Supplementary information, Figure S3). Reflecting a reciprocal relationship to their growth curves, the culture medium for HeLa or MCF-7 cells exhibited a similar temporal decrease of pH values in the presence of 5 mM or higher Gln. By contrast, the pH value of the HeLa or MCF-7 culture medium showed much less decrease in the absence of Gln, presumably due to lack of cell growth. In the absence of cells, the culture medium pH remained largely unchanged over time (Supplementary information, Figure S3).If acidic pH caused by cell growth is detrimental to continued cell growth, then continued supply of buffered medium might alleviate this problem. To examine this scenario, we cultured HeLa or MCF-7 cells at relatively constant pH, with medium change every 8 h. At pH 7.3, HeLa and MCF-7 cells exhibited robust growth even in the absence of Gln (Figure 1A). By contrast, cell growth was considerably less at pH 6.3 in the absence of Gln (Figure 1A). Consistent with this analysis, the presence of 10 mM Gln allowed robust cell growth at both pH 6.3 and pH 7.3 (Supplementary information, Figure S4). Together, our data suggest that, for HeLa or MCF-7 cancer cells, Gln might provide an efficient means of countering the acidic stress.Figure 1L-glutamine (Gln) may play an essential role in cancer cell growth through enzymatic release of ammonia for acid resistance. (A) HeLa and MCF-7 cells grow in the absence of Gln with continued supply of buffered medium. HeLa and MCF-7 cells were cultured without Gln at pH 6.3 and 7.3. Culture medium was changed every 8 h to maintain relatively constant pH value. Cell density was determined by the CV staining method. (B) HeLa and MCF-7 cells consume more Gln and release more glutamate (Glu) in culture medium of lower pH. Two pH values, 6.5 and 7.0, were used. Gln and Glu concentrations were determined by mass spectrometric analysis. (C) Inhibition of glutaminase activity results in reduction of cell survival and growth under acidic environment. Relative cell growth indicates the normalized change of cell number after cell growth in different medium for 8 h. A relative cell growth value of 0.05 means 5% additional cell growth compared to that at hour 0. The results shown were the average of 10 independent experiments. Medium pH is buffered by 25 mM PIPES. (D) The GLS1 splice variant GAC exhibits a higher activity than KGA, especially at pH 6.0. Shown here is in vitro activity characterization of GAC and KGA at different pH values. The glutaminase activity was measured by the Glu dehydrogenase-based, two-step glutaminase protocol. The proteins used here contain an N-terminal truncation (residues 1-122) for better expression in E. coli. (E) A schematic diagram to illustrate our hypothesis on the essential role of Gln in cancer cell survival.Full size imageIf Gln is used for acid resistance, then we would expect to see consumption of Gln from, and release of Glu into, the culture medium. In addition, there might be more consumption of Gln at lower pH. To investigate this scenario, we cultured HeLa or MCF-7 cells in the presence of 0.5 mM L-[U-13C5, -U-15N2] Gln and 10 mM unlabelled Gln at pH 6.5 or 7.0. After 8 h, the remaining Gln in the culture medium was quantified using mass spectrometry. For both HeLa and MCF-7 cells, there is more cell growth at pH 7.0 than at pH 6.5 (Supplementary information, Figure S5); yet consumption of Gln at pH 6.5, normalized for cell density, is considerably more than that at pH 7.0 (Figure 1B, left panel). Specifically, compared to pH 7.0, HeLa and MCF-7 cells at pH 6.5 exhibit 61% and 37% more consumption of Gln, respectively. Consistent with intracellular conversion of Gln to Glu, the concentrations of Glu in the culture medium increased by 39% and 33%, respectively, for HeLa and MCF-7 cells (Figure 1B, right panel).If conversion of Gln to Glu is required for acid resistance, then inhibition of the glutaminase activity is expected to preferentially inhibit cell growth at lower pH. To examine this scenario, we cultured HeLa and MCF-7 cells in medium with or without glutaminase inhibitor at pH 6.0 and 6.5. At both pH values, despite the presence of 10 mM Gln, there were much less cells in the presence of the glutaminase GLS1-specific inhibitor 968 compared to its absence (Figure 1C). Serving as a control in these experiments, cell growth in the absence of Gln was considerably worse than that in the presence of Gln. These results also suggest that GLS1 is likely a crucial enzyme for glutaminolysis in HeLa and MCF-7 cells under acidic stress.Many mammalian enzymes are active only within a narrow pH window. To examine the pH dependence of glutaminase activity, we expressed and purified the two GLS1 isoforms (KGA and GAC) to homogeneity and measured their enzymatic activity in vitro. The result clearly shows that, even at pH 6.0, both GAC and KGA retained significant glutaminase activity (Figure 1D). GAC exhibited a higher level of glutaminase activity than KGA at pH 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0. In particular, GAC exhibits approximately 108% higher activity compared to KGA at pH 6.0. This result suggests that the GLS1 splice variant GAC may be more important for cancer cell growth under acidic pH.These experimental observations serve as preliminary evidence to support our hypothesis that Gln may play an important role in cancer cell survival and growth through enzymatic release of ammonia for acid resistance (Figure 1E). In other words, the reliance of cancer cells on Gln is not just for nutrition but more importantly also for the purpose of fighting acid stress as a result of Warburg Effect. As the first step for metabolic utilization of Gln involves the glutaminase activity, it is inherently difficult to separate the two potential functions of Gln — carbon/nitrogen source versus acid resistance. Any molecular biology manipulation of glutaminases simultaneously affects both metabolic utilization of Gln and its role in acid resistance. Nonetheless, our finding that Gln is preferentially converted to Glu in the culture medium of lower pH strongly supports the acid resistance hypothesis. To the best of our knowledge, this may be the first time that an important role for Gln in cancer cell growth through acid resistance is proposed. Such a conceptual advance has important ramifications for understanding cancer cell homeostasis and for designing potential therapeutic treatment.

"cr","Def defines a conserved nucleolar pathway that leads p53 to proteasome-independent degradation","p53 protein turnover through the ubiquitination pathway is a vital mechanism in the regulation of its transcriptional activity; however, little is known about p53 turnover through proteasome-independent pathway(s). The digestive organ expansion factor (Def) protein is essential for the development of digestive organs. In zebrafish, loss of function of def selectively upregulates the expression of p53 response genes, which raises a question as to what is the relationship between Def and p53. We report here that Def is a nucleolar protein and that loss of function of def leads to the upregulation of p53 protein, which surprisingly accumulates in the nucleoli. Our extensive studies have demonstrated that Def can mediate the degradation of p53 protein and that this process is independent of the proteasome pathway, but dependent on the activity of Calpain3, a cysteine protease. Our findings define a novel nucleolar pathway that regulates the turnover function of p53, which will advance our understanding of p53's role in organogenesis and tumorigenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201316"
"cr","Trinucleotide repeat expansions catalyzed by human cell-free extracts","Trinucleotide repeat expansions cause 17 heritable human neurological disorders. In some diseases, somatic expansions occur in non-proliferating tissues such as brain where DNA replication is limited. This finding stimulated significant interest in replication-independent expansion mechanisms. Aberrant DNA repair is a likely source, based in part on mouse studies showing that somatic expansions are provoked by the DNA repair protein MutSβ (Msh2-Msh3 complex). Biochemical studies to date used cell-free extracts or purified DNA repair proteins to yield partial reactions at triplet repeats. The findings included expansions on one strand but not the other, or processing of DNA hairpin structures thought to be important intermediates in the expansion process. However, it has been difficult to recapitulate complete expansions in vitro, and the biochemical role of MutSβ remains controversial. Here, we use a novel in vitro assay to show that human cell-free extracts catalyze expansions and contractions of trinucleotide repeats without the requirement for DNA replication. The extract promotes a size range of expansions that is similar to certain diseases, and triplet repeat length and sequence govern expansions in vitro as in vivo. MutSβ stimulates expansions in the extract, consistent with aberrant repair of endogenous DNA damage as a source of expansions. Overall, this biochemical system retains the key characteristics of somatic expansions in humans and mice, suggesting that this important mutagenic process can be restored in the test tube.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201312"
"cr","Decoding the phosphorylation code in Hedgehog signal transduction","Hedgehog (Hh) signaling plays pivotal roles in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, and its deregulation leads to numerous human disorders including cancer. Binding of Hh to Patched (Ptc), a twelve-transmembrane protein, alleviates its inhibition of Smoothened (Smo), a seven-transmembrane protein related to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), leading to Smo phosphorylation and activation. Smo acts through intracellular signaling complexes to convert the latent transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci)/Gli from a truncated repressor to a full-length activator, leading to derepression/activation of Hh target genes. Increasing evidence suggests that phosphorylation participates in almost every step in the signal relay from Smo to Ci/Gli, and that differential phosphorylation of several key pathway components may be crucial for translating the Hh morphogen gradient into graded pathway activities. In this review, we focus on the multifaceted roles that phosphorylation plays in Hh signal transduction, and discuss the conservation and difference between Drosophila and mammalian Hh signaling mechanisms.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201310"
"cr","L-glutamine provides acid resistance for Escherichia coli through enzymatic release of ammonia","Bacteria, exemplified by enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli), rely on elaborate acid resistance systems to survive acidic environment (such as the stomach). Comprehensive understanding of bacterial acid resistance is important for prevention and clinical treatment. In this study, we report a previously uncharacterized type of acid resistance system in E. coli that relies on L-glutamine (Gln), one of the most abundant food-borne free amino acids. Upon uptake into E. coli, Gln is converted to L-glutamate (Glu) by the acid-activated glutaminase YbaS, with concomitant release of gaseous ammonia. The free ammonia neutralizes proton, resulting in elevated intracellular pH under acidic environment. We show that YbaS and the amino acid antiporter GadC, which exchanges extracellular Gln with intracellular Glu, together constitute an acid resistance system that is sufficient for E. coli survival under extremely acidic environment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201313"
"cr","A novel Bayesian network inference algorithm for integrative analysis of heterogeneous deep sequencing data","Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology has enabled sequencing millions of short DNA tags in a single pass. NGS-based techniques such as ChIP-Seq/BS-Seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/Bisulfite conversion followed by deep sequencing) have become predominant approaches for genome-wide quantification of transcription factor binding sites, histone modifications/variants and DNA methylation1. The rapidly increasing volume of ChIP-Seq and other deep sequencing data calls for the urgent need of developing analytical tools for processing these data and extracting meaningful biological knowledge from them. Till now, a number of software tools that are designed to map tag sequences to the genome2 or to find “peak” chromosomal regions with enriched mapped tags3 have been readily available, yet tools that target the primary goal of generating testable biological hypotheses directly from NGS data barely exist.A general question in the analysis of NGS data is how to de novo infer the combinatorial interactions (and if possible, their causalities) between different factors probed by ChIP-Seq experiments (e.g., transcription factors, histone modifications) and/or other factors probed by non-ChIP-Seq experiments (e.g., RNA-Seq, BS-Seq). For example, recently it was demonstrated that distinct genomic elements are cooperatively marked by histone modifications/variants and DNA methylation, which form so-called combinatorial chromatin states4. However, few software tools are designed for directly reverse engineering the molecular interactions that give rise to the combinatorial chromatin states. To address this, we developed a new Bayesian network (BN) structure learning algorithm “SeqSpider”, for inferring regulatory relationships/interactions between a set of biological factors using heterogeneous NGS data sets of different types (discrete/real/profile) generated by the same or different laboratories.BN is an ideal probabilistic formalism for inferring regulatory networks5. By systematically searching for the global network that best fits the data, it can disambiguate direct/indirect interactions and de novo identify potentially causal relationships, which are not possible in correlation-based network inference algorithms. However, most practical BN learning algorithms only accept discrete training data (c.f. systems biology applications of these algorithms6,7,8). This limitation is even more conspicuous when BN is applied to NGS data as these algorithms cannot model tag distributions, an important feature of NGS data. This problem is completely resolved by the SeqSpider algorithm, which simultaneously accepts tag distributions as well as discrete/continuous variables. Together with a profile-based clustering strategy for noise reduction, SeqSpider successfully predicted with high accuracy and high stability the molecular interactions in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) from heterogeneous NGS data sets generated by three different laboratories9,10 (ChIP-Seq of seven histone modifications and seven transcription factors, BS-Seq and RNA-Seq data). On the contrary, the accuracy and stability achieved by conventional discrete data-based BN learning algorithms11,12 are significantly lower on the same data sets (see below and Figure 1).Figure 1Comparing SeqSpider with conventional BN learning algorithms on predicting the hESC regulatory network from NGS data sets. (A) The consensus hESC regulatory network inferred by SeqSpider. The color of an edge indicates the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between the total tag counts within TSS ± 2Kb (or TTS ± 2Kb for H3K36me3) for the two interacting nodes. (B) Stability of the consensus network inferred by SeqSpider (as shown in (A), panel f) compared with alternative implementations using different types of training data with/without profile clustering (other panels). Network stability curves are evaluated on 10-fold incomplete training samples.

(C) Significance of literature co-citation rates for networks inferred by different algorithms and on distinct types of data (null/sk/k-means/ap: no clustering/the super k-means/the classic k-means/the affinity propagation algorithm-based profile clustering is performed; vec/real/dis: vectored/real-valued/discrete training data).

(F) Prototype of information flow of the network in (A). The input from one modification or enhancer activity that feeds into H3K4me3 at TSS will lead the information to flow out of the hub and engage other modifications or enhancers.Full size imageAn example demonstrates the unique advantage of SeqSpider for seamlessly integrating multi-source and multi-type NGS data to infer a regulatory network for a certain cellular context, in this case, the self-renewing hESCs (Figure 1A). This advantage mainly comes from two technical innovations. First, we proposed a new kernel function for sequence tag distributions (termed the “L1 reciprocal partial sums” (L1-RPS) kernel, see Supplementary information, Methods) to enable BN learning from tag profiles (as vectors) in addition to discrete and continuous data. A kernel can be seen as an inner product (an operation on two vectors that produces a scalar) in a high/infinite dimensional feature space. By incorporating the L1-RPS kernel in an optimized implementation of a kernel-based BN scoring approach13, the information stripping data discretization step in the conventional BN learning methods11 is avoided (Supplementary information, Methods S1). Second, we exploited the “Super k-means” algorithm to cluster genes with similar TF/modification patterns (represented by concatenated gene-wise tag profiles and expression value) to reduce noise and sampling biases in training data (Supplementary information, Methods S1). By applying this profile-based clustering step and then learning BN on the resulting cluster centers, SeqSpider achieves significantly better stability and accuracy in network inference than conventional methods11,12 and the original kernel-based BN algorithm on real-valued data13 (Figure 1B, 1C, and 1E, Supplementary information, Note S2).SeqSpider employed 10-dimensional vectors with uniform bins to represent the ChIP-Seq and BS-Seq signal at (– 2 kb, + 2 kb) around each TSS (or TTS for H3K36me3), and one-dimensional continuous variable to represent gene expression levels. The value in each element of a vector is the log-transformed and standardized (z-score normalized) tag count (Supplementary information, Methods S1). Then, we thoroughly compared SeqSpider with the existing BN learning algorithms that only accept discrete/continuous data11,12,13 with/without the profile-clustering step. To evaluate the performance of different BN learning algorithms, two criteria are used: network stability on partial training data7 and literature co-citation rate for network edges. The results suggest that both the modeling of tag distributions and the profile-clustering step for data preprocessing are necessary for SeqSpider to achieve significantly better performance than conventional algorithms (Figure 1B and 1C). We also tested alternative implementations of the two key components in SeqSpider, either using the classic k-means (in Cluster 3.0)/affinity propagation14 algorithm for profile-clustering or using two other ways to define the kernel for tag distributions. The results suggest that the performance of these alternative methods could not match the level of the SeqSpider algorithm (Figure 1C, Supplementary information, Notes S2 and S13). Testing results also demonstrate that the output of SeqSpider is robust to the choice of both the single customizable parameter (the weight of the penalty term in scoring function) and the internal parameter (kernel widths); and the learned network is not overfitted to training data (Supplementary information, Notes S3, S11 and S12).In addition to the significantly higher literature co-citation rate in hESC regulator network inferred by SeqSpider compared with alternative algorithms (Figure 1C), the network is further supported by the cellular context-independent, genomic sequence-based motif interaction BN, as demonstrated by the significant overlap between the two networks (Figure 1D, P = 0.0067). Pair-wise comparison on the significance of network overlaps further demonstrates that SeqSpider performs the best among all alternative algorithms tested (Figure 1E). Furthermore, by taking the regulator BN as template, we also learned a constrained motif interaction network using SeqSpider, revealing sequence motifs that potentially mediate the regulator interactions in the hESC context (Supplementary information, Figure S22). The unconstrained/constrained motif networks overlap well (Figure 1D and 1E, P = 6.15E-8) and both of them are further validated by independent evidence, the spatial closeness of motif locations in the promoter regions (Supplementary information, Figure S23).The regulator network brought new biological insights into hESCs. First, NGS data from different laboratories and of different types9,10 are fully intermingled in the network according to their biological relationships (Figure 1A, Supplementary information, Note S4). Second, H3K4me3, which directly correlates with gene expression, stays at the center of the network and connects six major regulatory domains. Both the domain structures and 87.5% edges in the network have been reported in literature (except two edges: H3K27me3-H3K9ac, NANOG-TAFII) (Figure 1A, Supplementary information, Note S4). Third, although this network does not include directed edges, SeqSpider's capability of correctly predicting causal relationships is proven theoretically and demonstrated on a CD4+ T-cell ChIP-Seq data set1,7 (Supplementary information, Note S14). The star-shaped topology of the hESC network is further demonstrated by an independent mESC network, by a larger hESC network with more recent ChIP-Seq data and by networks learned from different groups of promoters (Supplementary information, Notes S15, S16 and S17). According to BN theory, this topology indicates that any input arrow pointing toward H3K4me3 will lead to outward flow toward all other branches, implicating dynamic communication among these regulatory domains (Figure 1F, Supplementary information, Note S5). Though this is still a hypothesis, the bidirectional nature of one edge H3K4me3-Oct4 has recently been demonstrated experimentally in hESC15. The difference of the connectivity and directionality of edges around H3K4me3 between the hESC and the CD4+ T-cell network is likely to reflect the diverse regulatory program in the two cell types (Supplementary information, Note S8). Finally, we found that the missing of a few known regulatory relationships in the hESC network is not the fault of SeqSpider, but simply because they are not well supported by the NGS data sets or due to BN's acyclic constraint. To relax the acyclic constraint, we developed a post-BN learning graph search method, which successfully recovered some known interactions otherwise missed (Supplementary information, Methods S1, Notes S18 and S19).To conclude, by modeling sequence tag distributions and introducing the profile-clustering strategy for noise reduction, SeqSpider achieved significantly better performance than previous BN algorithms for inferring a regulatory network from NGS data sets, and allowed for the first time seamless integration of heterogeneous data types from different sources. Given the fast growing volume of NGS data, SeqSpider (http://www.picb.ac.cn/hanlab/seqspider.html) will become an important tool for reverse-engineering regulatory networks of various biological contexts.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20138"
"cr","Reelin induces EphB activation","The integration of newborn neurons into functional neuronal networks requires migration of cells to their final position in the developing brain, the growth and arborization of neuronal processes and the formation of synaptic contacts with other neurons. A central player among the signals that coordinate this complex sequence of differentiation events is the secreted glycoprotein Reelin, which also modulates synaptic plasticity, learning and memory formation in the adult brain. Binding of Reelin to ApoER2 and VLDL receptor, two members of the LDL receptor family, initiates a signaling cascade involving tyrosine phosphorylation of the intracellular cytoplasmic adaptor protein Disabled-1, which targets the neuronal cytoskeleton and ultimately controls the positioning of neurons throughout the developing brain. However, it is possible that Reelin signals interact with other receptor-mediated signaling cascades to regulate different aspects of brain development and plasticity. EphB tyrosine kinases regulate cell adhesion and repulsion-dependent processes via bidirectional signaling through ephrin B transmembrane proteins. Here, we demonstrate that Reelin binds to the extracellular domains of EphB transmembrane proteins, inducing receptor clustering and activation of EphB forward signaling in neurons, independently of the 'classical' Reelin receptors, ApoER2 and VLDLR. Accordingly, mice lacking EphB1 and EphB2 display a positioning defect of CA3 hippocampal pyramidal neurons, similar to that in Reelin-deficient mice, and this cell migration defect depends on the kinase activity of EphB proteins. Together, our data provide biochemical and functional evidence for signal integration between Reelin and EphB forward signaling.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20137"
"cr","Nitric oxide suppresses NLRP3 inflammasome activation and protects against LPS-induced septic shock","Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that trigger the activation of caspase-1 and the maturation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), yet the regulation of these complexes remains poorly characterized. Here we show that nitric oxide (NO) inhibited the NLRP3-mediated ASC pyroptosome formation, caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion in myeloid cells from both mice and humans. Meanwhile, endogenous NO derived from iNOS (inducible form of NO synthase) also negatively regulated NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Depletion of iNOS resulted in increased accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria in response to LPS and ATP, which was responsible for the increased IL-1β production and caspase-1 activation. iNOS deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of NO production enhanced NLRP3-dependent cytokine production in vivo, thus increasing mortality from LPS-induced sepsis in mice, which was prevented by NLRP3 deficiency. Our results thus identify NO as a critical negative regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome via the stabilization of mitochondria. This study has important implications for the design of new strategies to control NLRP3-related diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20136"
"cr","XBP-1u suppresses autophagy by promoting the degradation of FoxO1 in cancer cells","Autophagy is activated to maintain cellular energy homeostasis in response to nutrient starvation. However, autophagy is not persistently activated, which is poorly understood at a mechanistic level. Here, we report that turnover of FoxO1 is involved in the dynamic autophagic process caused by glutamine starvation. X-box-binding protein-1u (XBP-1u) has a critical role in FoxO1 degradation by recruiting FoxO1 to the 20S proteasome. In addition, the phosphorylation of XBP-1u by extracellular regulated protein kinases1/2 (ERK1/2) on Ser61 and Ser176 was found to be critical for the increased interaction between XBP-1u and FoxO1 upon glutamine starvation. Furthermore, knockdown of XBP-1u caused the sustained level of FoxO1 and the persistent activation of autophagy, leading to a significant decrease in cell viability. Finally, the inverse correlation between XBP-1u and FoxO1 expression agrees well with the expression profiles observed in many human cancer tissues. Thus, our findings link the dynamic process of autophagy to XBP-1u-induced FoxO1 degradation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20132"
"cr","β-Arrestin1 regulates γ-secretase complex assembly and modulates amyloid-β pathology","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and complex neurodegenerative disease in which the γ-secretase-mediated amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology plays an important role. We found that a multifunctional protein, β-arrestin1, facilitated the formation of NCT/APH-1 (anterior pharynx-defective phenotype 1) precomplex and mature γ-secretase complex through its functional interaction with APH-1. Deficiency of β-arrestin1 or inhibition of binding of β-arrestin1 with APH-1 by small peptides reduced Aβ production without affecting Notch processing. Genetic ablation of β-arrestin1 diminished Aβ pathology and behavioral deficits in transgenic AD mice. Moreover, in brains of sporadic AD patients and transgenic AD mice, the expression of β-arrestin1 was upregulated and correlated well with neuropathological severity and senile Aβ plaques. Thus, our study identifies a regulatory mechanism underlying both γ-secretase assembly and AD pathogenesis, and indicates that specific reduction of Aβ pathology can be achieved by regulation of the γ-secretase assembly.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2012167"
"cr","The human long non-coding RNA-RoR is a p53 repressor in response to DNA damage","It is well known that upon stress, the level of the tumor suppressor p53 is remarkably elevated. However, despite extensive studies, the underlying mechanism involving important inter-players for stress-induced p53 regulation is still not fully understood. We present evidence that the human lincRNA-RoR (RoR) is a strong negative regulator of p53. Unlike MDM2 that causes p53 degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, RoR suppresses p53 translation through direct interaction with the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein I (hnRNP I). Importantly, a 28-base RoR sequence carrying hnRNP I binding motifs is essential and sufficient for p53 repression. We further show that RoR inhibits p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrate a RoR-p53 autoregulatory feedback loop where p53 transcriptionally induces RoR expression. Together, these results suggest that the RoR-hnRNP I-p53 axis may constitute an additional surveillance network for the cell to better respond to various stresses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2012164"
"cr","A novel class of tRNA-derived small RNAs extremely enriched in mature mouse sperm","The discovery of sperm-borne RNAs (mRNAs and small non-coding RNAs) has opened the possibility of additional paternal contributions aside from providing the DNA1. It has been reported that the incoming sperm can provide information for its host egg cytoplasm, which functionally influences the order of cell division2, possibly via delivering RNAs. Indeed, the sperm-borne miRNA and mRNA have been demonstrated as active players in early embryo development3 and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance4. However, given the diversity of small RNA classes (miRNA, endo-siRNA, piRNA, etc.) generated during spermatogenesis, the contents and profiles of the small RNA population carried by mature sperm remain undefined. In the present study, we isolated mature sperm from the cauda epididymis of adult male mice (Supplementary information, Data S1). The purity of sperm was > 99% as evaluated by microscopy and was confirmed by RT-PCR analyses of different biomarkers (Supplementary information, Figure S1A and S1B). The RNA extracted from mature sperm, adult testis, and uterus were processed for small RNA (< 40 nt) deep sequencing (Supplementary information, Figure S1C, S1D, S1E and Data S1). The total small RNA reads and genome-mapping statistic data (Supplementary information, Table S1) showed an abundance of small RNAs carried by mature sperm. The overall length distribution of small RNAs (Figure 1A) revealed that the dominant reads from mature sperm were at 29-34 nt, slightly different from adult testis (26-32 nt), and distinct from uterus (21-23 nt). The majority of the 26-32 nt small RNAs in mouse testis are piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), which are actively involved in retrotransposon silencing that protects the integrity of the genome5. As it was initially suggested that piRNAs are absent in the cauda epididymis6 and that mammalian PIWI proteins (MILI, MIWI, MIWI2) are not expressed in mature sperm5, the abundant existence of 29-34 nt small RNAs in the mature sperm is somewhat surprising to us and suggests that they might be different from the well-known piRNA population from testis. Further analysis has revealed a distinct signature for these mature-sperm-enriched small RNAs, which represent a novel class of abundantly expressed small RNAs that can be grouped into distinct families. The small RNAs within each family showed identical 5′ sequences and only differed at their distal 3′ ends (Figure 1B and Supplementary information, Figure S2), suggesting that they are derived from the same precursor sequence. Particularly, two of these small RNA families were extremely enriched, which comprised 38.19% (family-1) and 19.14% (family-2) of all small RNA reads, respectively (Figure 1B), and together they accounted for the majority of the 30-34 nt small RNA population (Figure 1C).Figure 1Identification and characterization of tRNA-derived small RNAs in mature mouse sperm.

(N) RT-PCR analyses of mse-tsRNA family-1 and -2 in mature sperm from mouse, rat and human.Full size imageTo further characterize these mature-sperm-enriched small RNAs, we performed BLAT searches for the top two abundant families against the mouse genomic databases (mm9). As shown in Figure 1D, these small RNAs are located at multiple sites on the genome, with several clusters on chromosomes 1, 8 and 13. Most strikingly, each of these genomic locations corresponds to a tRNA locus (Figure 1D). By further comparing with the genomic tRNA database, we found that each of these small RNA families unanimously matches to the 5′ half of a specific tRNA, with cleavage sites located preferentially at the anticodon loop (30-34 nt from the 5′ end), as illustrated for families 1-2 (Figure 1E and 1F) and for families 3-7 (Supplementary information, Figure S2). Their ultra-high enrichment (Figure 1G) and the preferential cleavage sites and length distributions strongly suggested that these small RNAs are not generated randomly by tRNA degradation, but under strict cleavage regulations. As these small RNAs are highly enriched in mature sperm and are derived from tRNAs, we termed them “mature-sperm-enriched tRNA-derived small RNAs” (mse-tsRNAs).Indeed, recent evidence has demonstrated that tRNA-derived RNA fragments are biologically functional7, and their production could be induced under various stress conditions (physical or chemical stress) by specific RNase8. The mature sperm is produced from testicular spermatogenesis followed by maturation during passage through the epididymis. The physiological condition and specific enzyme governing mse-tsRNAs production and accumulation in mature sperm are currently unknown.To monitor the biogenesis of mse-tsRNAs during sperm formation, we next analyzed purified mouse testicular spermatogenic cells (type A spermatogonia, pachytene spermatocytes, round spermatids and elongated spermatids) and mature sperm. We found that the levels of mse-tsRNA family-1 and -2 were relatively constant during the early stages of spermatogenesis, and were substantially increased at late- (family-1) or post-spermatogenesis (family-2) (Figure 1H). The RT-PCR results were further confirmed by analyzing small RNA deep-sequencing data obtained from purified mouse testicular spermatogenic cells9 and mature sperm (Figure 1I and 1J). By analyzing the PCR product size followed by product sequencing, we could find both mse-tsRNAs and their tRNA precursors, supporting the hypothesis that the mse-tsRNAs are derived from tRNA cleavage (Figure 1H). Interestingly, we consistently observed a sequence (52 nt) in mse-tsRNA family-2 PCR products, which is shorter than the expected length of intact tRNA and mapped to its 5′ portion (Figure 1H), suggesting the involvement of a two-step cleavage of tRNA in generating mse-tsRNA family-2. The increase of mse-tsRNA family-1 and -2 seems not to correlate with the expression of mammalian PIWI proteins (MILI, MIWI, MIWI2)5, suggesting that they might not be closely related to the piRNAs, and their ultra-high enrichment in mature sperm might be due to specific tRNA cleavage and/or selective accumulation of cleavage products at late- or post-spermatogenesis (such as during epididymal transition). The underlying mechanisms are currently unknown.We also analyzed the relative expression of miR-34c by RT-PCR as a quality control, as its expression in spermatogenic cells and mature sperm have been previously reported3,10. As shown in Figure 1H, our results were consistent with previous reports that miR-34c was almost absent in spermatogonia, but was highly expressed from pachytene spermatocytes and continued to be highly expressed in spermatids10 and mature sperm3. Note that miR-34c expression in mature sperm is much less than that of mse-tsRNA family-1 and -2, as shown by the RT-PCR results and by the reads number from our miRNA profiling database (Supplementary information, Figure S3).It is important to determine whether the sperm-borne mse-tsRNAs are located in sperm head, which could indicate their potential delivery into oocytes at fertilization. Using established methods to isolate purified sperm heads, we demonstrated that mse-tsRNAs are abundantly localized in the purified sperm head (Figure 1K and 1L), suggesting that they could be delivered into oocytes at fertilization. We next analyzed the expression levels of mse-tsRNA family-1 in oocytes, zygotes and parthenogenetically activated oocytes. Surprisingly, quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the level of mse-tsRNA family-1 in zygotes is significantly lower than that in the oocytes and parthenogenetically activated oocytes (Supplementary information, Figure S4). These results might suggest a fertilization-triggered usage/consumption of mse-tsRNAs, which may reflect a functional role for mse-tsRNAs in early embryo events.As the mse-tsRNAs are derived from their tRNA templates, their sequence conservation could simply reflect the evolutionary conservation of their tRNA precursors. As shown in the evolutionary conservation analysis (Figure 1M and Supplementary information, Table S2), the tRNAs generating mse-tsRNA families 1-7 are highly conserved in vertebrate species, from fish to mammals, but absent from the worms, flies and plants. Indeed, besides our reported data for mouse sperm, existing small RNA datasets have shown that the mse-tsRNA family-1 is among the most highly expressed small RNA sequences in zebra fish testis (NCBI GEO Datasets: GSM830247)11 and human sperm (NCBI GEO Datasets: GSM530235)12, supporting the spermatozoal expression of mse-tsRNAs in a wide range of species. The expression of mse-tsRNA family-1 and -2 in mature sperm from mouse, rat and human were further analyzed using RT-PCR and confirmed by product sequencing (Figure 1N). These results suggest that mse-tsRNAs might serve as an ancient paternal element with evolutionarily conserved functions.Taken together, the present study revealed a previously hidden layer of sperm-borne small RNAs, identifying a novel class of tRNA-derived mse-tsRNAs with ultra-high accumulation in mature sperm. The biogenesis and function of these mse-tsRNAs are interesting topics that warrant future investigations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2012141"
"cr","Stress-mediated p38 activation promotes somatic cell reprogramming","Environmental stress-mediated adaptation plays essential roles in the evolution of life. Cellular adaptation mechanisms usually involve the regulation of chromatin structure, transcription, mRNA stability and translation, which eventually lead to efficient changes in gene expression. Global epigenetic change is also involved in the reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by defined factors. Here we report that environmental stress such as hyperosmosis not only facilitates four factor-mediated reprogramming, but also enhances two or one factor-induced iPS cell generation. Hyperosmosis-induced p38 activation plays a critical role in this process. Constitutive active p38 mimics the positive effect of hyperosmosis, while dominant negative p38 and p38 inhibitor block the effect of hyperosmosis. Further study indicates stress-mediated p38 activation may promote reprogramming by reducing the global DNA methylation level and enhancing the expression of pluripotency genes. Our results demonstrate how simple environmental stress like hyperosmosis helps to alter the fate of cells via intracellular signaling and epigenetic modulation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2012143"
"cr","Activated mouse CD4+Foxp3− T cells facilitate melanoma metastasis via Qa-1-dependent suppression of NK-cell cytotoxicity","The regulatory activities of mouse CD4+Foxp3+ T cells on various immune cells, including NK cells, have been well documented. Under some conditions, conventional CD4+Foxp3− T cells in the periphery are able to acquire inhibitory function on other T cells, but their roles in controlling innate immune cells are poorly defined. As a potential cellular therapy for cancer, ex vivo activated CD4+Foxp3− effector T cells are often infused back in vivo to suppress tumor growth and metastasis. Whether such activated T cells could affect NK-cell control of tumorigenesis is unclear. In the present study, we found that mitogen-activated CD4+Foxp3− T cells exhibited potent suppressor function on NK-cell proliferation and cytotoxicity in vitro, and notably facilitated B16 melanoma metastasis in vivo. Suppression of NK cells by activated CD4+Foxp3− T cells is cell-cell contact dependent and is mediated by Qa-1:NKG2A interaction, as administration of antibodies blocking either Qa-1 or NKG2A could completely reverse this suppression, and significantly inhibited otherwise facilitated melanoma metastasis. Moreover, activated CD4+Foxp3− cells from Qa-1 knockout mice completely lost the suppressor activity on NK cells, and failed to facilitate melanoma metastasis when transferred in vivo. Taken together, our findings indicate that innate anti-tumor response is counter regulated by the activation of adaptive immunity, a phenomenon we term as “activation-induced inhibition”. Thus, the regulatory role of activated CD4+Foxp3− T cells in NK-cell activity must be taken into consideration in the future design of cancer therapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2012128"
"cr","The R-Ras/RIN2/Rab5 complex controls endothelial cell adhesion and morphogenesis via active integrin endocytosis and Rac signaling","During developmental and tumor angiogenesis, semaphorins regulate blood vessel navigation by signaling through plexin receptors that inhibit the R-Ras subfamily of small GTPases. R-Ras is mainly expressed in vascular cells, where it induces adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) through unknown mechanisms. We identify the Ras and Rab5 interacting protein RIN2 as a key effector that in endothelial cells interacts with and mediates the pro-adhesive and -angiogenic activity of R-Ras. Both R-Ras-GTP and RIN2 localize at nascent ECM adhesion sites associated with lamellipodia. Upon binding, GTP-loaded R-Ras converts RIN2 from a Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) to an adaptor that first interacts at high affinity with Rab5-GTP to promote the selective endocytosis of ligand-bound/active β1 integrins and then causes the translocation of R-Ras to early endosomes. Here, the R-Ras/RIN2/Rab5 signaling module activates Rac1-dependent cell adhesion via TIAM1, a Rac GEF that localizes on early endosomes and is stimulated by the interaction with both Ras proteins and the vesicular lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate. In conclusion, the ability of R-Ras-GTP to convert RIN2 from a GEF to an adaptor that preferentially binds Rab5-GTP allows the triggering of the endocytosis of ECM-bound/active β1 integrins and the ensuing funneling of R-Ras-GTP toward early endosomes to elicit the pro-adhesive and TIAM1-mediated activation of Rac1.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2012110"
"cr","Determination of synthetic lethal interactions in KRAS oncogene-dependent cancer cells reveals novel therapeutic targeting strategies","Oncogenic mutations in RAS genes are very common in human cancer, resulting in cells with well-characterized selective advantages, but also less well-understood vulnerabilities. We have carried out a large-scale loss-of-function screen to identify genes that are required by KRAS-transformed colon cancer cells, but not by derivatives lacking this oncogene. Top-scoring genes were then tested in a larger panel of KRAS mutant and wild-type cancer cells. Cancer cells expressing oncogenic KRAS were found to be highly dependent on the transcription factor GATA2 and the DNA replication initiation regulator CDC6. Extending this analysis using a collection of drugs with known targets, we found that cancer cells with mutant KRAS showed selective addiction to proteasome function, as well as synthetic lethality with topoisomerase inhibition. Combination targeting of these functions caused improved killing of KRAS mutant cells relative to wild-type cells. These observations suggest novel targets and new ways of combining existing therapies for optimal effect in RAS mutant cancers, which are traditionally seen as being highly refractory to therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201282"
"cr","The Axin/TNKS complex interacts with KIF3A and is required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation","Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by the glucose transporter GLUT4 plays a central role in whole-body glucose homeostasis, dysregulation of which leads to type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular components and mechanisms regulating insulin-stimulated glucose uptake remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Axin interacts with the ADP-ribosylase tankyrase 2 (TNKS2) and the kinesin motor protein KIF3A, forming a ternary complex crucial for GLUT4 translocation in response to insulin. Specific knockdown of the individual components of the complex attenuated insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Importantly, TNKS2−/− mice exhibit reduced insulin sensitivity and higher blood glucose levels when re-fed after fasting. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that in the absence of insulin, Axin, TNKS and KIF3A are co-localized with GLUT4 on the trans-Golgi network. Insulin treatment suppresses the ADP-ribosylase activity of TNKS, leading to a reduction in ADP ribosylation and ubiquitination of both Axin and TNKS, and a concurrent stabilization of the complex. Inhibition of Akt, the major effector kinase of insulin signaling, abrogates the insulin-mediated complex stabilization. We have thus elucidated a new protein complex that is directly associated with the motor protein kinesin in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201252"
"cr","Crystal structure and biochemical analyses reveal Beclin 1 as a novel membrane binding protein","The Beclin 1 gene is a haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor and plays an essential role in autophagy. However, the molecular mechanism by which Beclin 1 functions remains largely unknown. Here we report the crystal structure of the evolutionarily conserved domain (ECD) of Beclin 1 at 1.6 Å resolution. Beclin 1 ECD exhibits a previously unreported fold, with three structural repeats arranged symmetrically around a central axis. Beclin 1 ECD defines a novel class of membrane-binding domain, with a strong preference for lipid membrane enriched with cardiolipin. The tip of a surface loop in Beclin 1 ECD, comprising three aromatic amino acids, acts as a hydrophobic finger to associate with lipid membrane, consequently resulting in the deformation of membrane and liposomes. Mutation of these aromatic residues rendered Beclin 1 unable to stably associate with lipid membrane in vitro and unable to fully rescue autophagy in Beclin 1-knockdown cells in vivo. These observations form an important framework for deciphering the biological functions of Beclin 1.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201224"
"cr","Glucose-induced posttranslational activation of protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 in yeast","The protein phosphatases PP2A and PP1 are major regulators of a variety of cellular processes in yeast and other eukaryotes. Here, we reveal that both enzymes are direct targets of glucose sensing. Addition of glucose to glucose-deprived yeast cells triggered rapid posttranslational activation of both PP2A and PP1. Glucose activation of PP2A is controlled by regulatory subunits Rts1, Cdc55, Rrd1 and Rrd2. It is associated with rapid carboxymethylation of the catalytic subunits, which is necessary but not sufficient for activation. Glucose activation of PP1 was fully dependent on regulatory subunits Reg1 and Shp1. Absence of Gac1, Glc8, Reg2 or Red1 partially reduced activation while Pig1 and Pig2 inhibited activation. Full activation of PP2A and PP1 was also dependent on subunits classically considered to belong to the other phosphatase. PP2A activation was dependent on PP1 subunits Reg1 and Shp1 while PP1 activation was dependent on PP2A subunit Rts1. Rts1 interacted with both Pph21 and Glc7 under different conditions and these interactions were Reg1 dependent. Reg1-Glc7 interaction is responsible for PP1 involvement in the main glucose repression pathway and we show that deletion of Shp1 also causes strong derepression of the invertase gene SUC2. Deletion of the PP2A subunits Pph21 and Pph22, Rrd1 and Rrd2, specifically enhanced the derepression level of SUC2, indicating that PP2A counteracts SUC2 derepression. Interestingly, the effect of the regulatory subunit Rts1 was consistent with its role as a subunit of both PP2A and PP1, affecting derepression and repression of SUC2, respectively. We also show that abolished phosphatase activation, except by reg1Δ, does not completely block Snf1 dephosphorylation after addition of glucose. Finally, we show that glucose activation of the cAMP-PKA (protein kinase A) pathway is required for glucose activation of both PP2A and PP1. Our results provide novel insight into the complex regulatory role of these two major protein phosphatases in glucose regulation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201220"
"cr","A distinct response to endogenous DNA damage in the development of Nbs1-deficient cortical neurons","Microcephaly is a clinical characteristic for human nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS, mutated in NBS1 gene), a chromosomal instability syndrome. However, the underlying molecular pathogenesis remains elusive. In the present study, we demonstrate that neuronal disruption of NBS (Nbn in mice) causes microcephaly characterized by the reduction of cerebral cortex and corpus callosum, recapitulating neuronal anomalies in human NBS. Nbs1-deficient neocortex shows accumulative endogenous DNA damage and defective activation of Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR)-Chk1 pathway upon DNA damage. Notably, in contrast to massive apoptotic cell death in Nbs1-deficient cerebella, activation of p53 leads to a defective neuroprogenitor proliferation in neocortex, likely via specific persistent induction of hematopoietic zinc finger (Hzf) that preferentially promotes p53-mediated cell cycle arrest whilst inhibiting apoptosis. Moreover, Trp53 mutations substantially rescue the microcephaly in Nbs1-deficient mice. Thus, the present results reveal the first clue that developing neurons at different regions of brain selectively respond to endogenous DNA damage, and underscore an important role for Nbs1 in neurogenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20123"

Here we show that a combination of five transcriptional factors Mash1, Ngn2, Sox2, Nurr1, and Pitx3 can directly and effectively reprogram human fibroblasts into DA neuron-like cells. The reprogrammed cells stained positive for various markers for DA neurons. They also showed characteristic DA uptake and production properties. Moreover, they exhibited DA neuron-specific electrophysiological profiles. Finally, they provided symptomatic relief in a rat PD model. Therefore, our directly reprogrammed DA neuron-like cells are a promising source of cell-replacement therapy for PD.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2011181"
"cr","SNX3 controls Wingless/Wnt secretion through regulating retromer-dependent recycling of Wntless","Drosophila Wingless (Wg) acts as a morphogen during development. Wg secretion is controlled by a seven-pass transmembrane cargo Wntless (Wls). We have recently identified retromer as a key regulator involved in Wls trafficking. As sorting nexin (SNX) molecules are essential components of the retromer complex, we hypothesized that specific SNX(s) is required for retromer-mediated Wnt secretion. Here, we generated Drosophila mutants for all of the eight snx members, and identified Drosophila SNX3 (DSNX3) as an essential molecule required for Wg secretion. We show that Wg secretion and its signaling activity are defective in Dsnx3 mutant clones in wing discs. Wg levels in the culture medium of Dsnx3-depleted S2 cells are also markedly reduced. Importantly, Wls levels are strikingly reduced in Dsnx3 mutant cells, and overexpression of Wls can rescue the Wg secretion defect observed in Dsnx3 mutant cells. Moreover, DSNX3 can interact with the retromer component Vps35, and co-localize with Vps35 in early endosomes. These data indicate that DSNX3 regulates Wg secretion via retromer-dependent Wls recycling. In contrast, we found that Wg secretion is not defective in cells mutant for Drosophila snx1 and snx6, two components of the classical retromer complex. Ectopic expression of DSNX1 or DSNX6 fails to rescue the Wg secretion defect in Dsnx3 mutant wing discs and in Dsnx3 dsRNA-treated S2 cells. These data demonstrate the specificity of the DSNX3-retromer complex in Wls recycling. Together, our findings suggest that DSNX3 acts as a cargo-specific component of retromer, which is required for endocytic recycling of Wls and Wg/Wnt secretion.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2011167"

Using lectin arrays, we analyzed glycoproteins extracted from 26 hPSC samples and 22 differentiated cell samples, and identified a small group of lectins with distinctive binding signatures that were sufficient to distinguish hPSCs from a variety of non-pluripotent cell types. These specific biomarkers were shared by all the 12 human embryonic stem cell and the 14 human induced pluripotent stem cell samples examined, regardless of the laboratory of origin, the culture conditions, the somatic cell type reprogrammed, or the reprogramming method used. We demonstrated a practical application of specific lectin binding by detecting hPSCs within a differentiated cell population with lectin-mediated staining followed by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, and by enriching and purging viable hPSCs from mixed cell populations using lectin-mediated cell separation. Global gene expression analysis showed pluripotency-associated differential expression of specific fucosyltransferases and sialyltransferases, which may underlie these differences in protein glycosylation and lectin binding. Taken together, our results show that protein glycosylation differs considerably between pluripotent and non-pluripotent cells, and demonstrate that lectins may be used as biomarkers to monitor pluripotency in stem cell populations and for removal of viable hPSCs from mixed cell populations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2011148"
"cr","Cardiomyocyte overexpression of miR-27b induces cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction in mice","Recent studies have begun to reveal critical roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction. In this study, we tested whether a transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-regulated miRNA played a pivotal role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (HF). We observed that miR-27b was upregulated in hearts of cardiomyocyte-specific Smad4 knockout mice, which developed cardiac hypertrophy. In vitro experiments showed that the miR-27b expression could be inhibited by TGF-β1 and that its overexpression promoted hypertrophic cell growth, while the miR-27b suppression led to inhibition of the hypertrophic cell growth caused by phenylephrine (PE) treatment. Furthermore, the analysis of transgenic mice with cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of miR-27b revealed that miR-27b overexpression was sufficient to induce cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction. We validated the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) as a direct target of miR-27b in cardiomyocyte. Consistently, the miR-27b transgenic mice displayed significantly lower levels of PPAR-γ than the control mice. Furthermore, in vivo silencing of miR-27b using a specific antagomir in a pressure-overload-induced mouse model of HF increased cardiac PPAR-γ expression, attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction. The results of our study demonstrate that TGF-β1-regulated miR-27b is involved in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy, and validate miR-27b as an efficient therapeutic target for cardiac diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2011132"
"cr","Transduction of the Hedgehog signal through the dimerization of Fused and the nuclear translocation of Cubitus interruptus","The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted proteins is essential for development in both vertebrates and invertebrates. As one of main morphogens during metazoan development, the graded Hh signal is transduced across the plasma membrane by Smoothened (Smo) through the differential phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic tail, leading to pathway activation and the differential expression of target genes. However, how Smo transduces the graded Hh signal via the Costal2 (Cos2)/Fused (Fu) complex remains poorly understood. Here we present a model of the cell response to a Hh gradient by translating Smo phosphorylation information to Fu dimerization and Cubitus interruptus (Ci) nuclear localization information. Our findings suggest that the phosphorylated C-terminus of Smo recruits the Cos2/Fu complex to the membrane through the interaction between Smo and Cos2, which further induces Fu dimerization. Dimerized Fu is phosphorylated and transduces the Hh signal by phosphorylating Cos2 and Suppressor of Fu (Su(fu)). We further show that this process promotes the dissociation of the full-length Ci (Ci155) and Cos2 or Su(fu), and results in the translocation of Ci155 into the nucleus, activating the expression of target genes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2011136"
"cr","Lineage-specific distribution of high levels of genomic","Methylation of cytosine is a DNA modification associated with gene repression. Recently, a novel cytosine modification, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) has been discovered. Here we examine 5-hmC distribution during mammalian development and in cellular systems, and show that the developmental dynamics of 5-hmC are different from those of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC); in particular 5-hmC is enriched in embryonic contexts compared to adult tissues. A detectable 5-hmC signal appears in pre-implantation development starting at the zygote stage, where the paternal genome is subjected to a genome-wide hydroxylation of 5-mC, which precisely coincides with the loss of the 5-mC signal in the paternal pronucleus. Levels of 5-hmC are high in cells of the inner cell mass in blastocysts, and the modification colocalises with nestin-expressing cell populations in mouse post-implantation embryos. Compared to other adult mammalian organs, 5-hmC is strongly enriched in bone marrow and brain, wherein high 5-hmC content is a feature of both neuronal progenitors and post-mitotic neurons. We show that high levels of 5-hmC are not only present in mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and lost during differentiation, as has been reported previously, but also reappear during the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells; thus 5-hmC enrichment correlates with a pluripotent cell state. Our findings suggest that apart from the cells of neuronal lineages, high levels of genomic 5-hmC are an epigenetic feature of embryonic cell populations and cellular pluri- and multi-lineage potency. To our knowledge, 5-hmC represents the first epigenetic modification of DNA discovered whose enrichment is so cell-type specific.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2011113"
"cr","Lithium, an anti-psychotic drug, greatly enhances the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells","Somatic cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by defined factors. The low efficiency of reprogramming and genomic integration of oncogenes and viral vectors limited the potential application of iPSCs. Here we report that Lithium (Li), a drug used to treat mood disorders, greatly enhances iPSC generation from both mouse embryonic fibroblast and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Li facilitates iPSC generation with one (Oct4) or two factors (OS or OK). The effect of Li on promoting reprogramming only partially depends on its major target GSK3β. Unlike other GSK3β inhibitors, Li not only increases the expression of Nanog, but also enhances the transcriptional activity of Nanog. We also found that Li exerts its effect by promoting epigenetic modifications via downregulation of LSD1, a H3K4-specific histone demethylase. Knocking down LSD1 partially mimics Li's effect in enhancing reprogramming. Our results not only provide a straightforward method to improve the iPSC generation efficiency, but also identified a histone demethylase as a critical modulator for somatic cell reprogramming.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2011108"
"cr","Two transposable element insertions are causative mutations for the major domestication gene teosinte branched 1 in modern maize","Transposable elements (TEs) have long been regarded as genomic parasites and occupy a significant portion of eukaryotic genomes because of their massive replication in host genomes. However, at times, TEs can also be domesticated by genes and thereby contribute new regulatory functions to genes 1, 2. Here we show that two TE insertions in a distant upstream region of tb1 are the causative mutations in the teosinte branched 1 (tb1) gene that account for the gene's role in the domestication of modern corn from its ancestor teosinte.Modern cultivated maize was domesticated from its wild ancestor teosinte (Zea mays ssp. Parviglumis) about 10 000 years ago 3. The plant morphological differences between cultivated maize and teosinte are dramatic. Such dramatic morphological changes are largely controlled by a small number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). One of these loci is largely responsible for the plant architecture changes from wild teosinte to cultivated modern maize and is allelic to the recessive maize mutant teosinte branched 1 (tb1). tb1 was cloned by transposon tagging in maize 4. It encodes a TCP transcriptional factor that is expressed in the axillary meristems and the stamen primordia of the maize ear 5. It has been proposed that Tb1 could repress bud outgrowth and increase apical dominance. However, the difference between the maize and teosinte tb1 alleles was quantitative, not qualitative. Both alleles may have nearly identical transcriptional units 6, but the maize allele has about twice the mRNA expression level of the teosinte allele. The cis-regulatory region that confers such molecular and phenotypic changes has been localized to a region 58-69 kb upstream of the tb1 coding region 7. This region is complex, containing two functional components within 64-69 kb and 58-64 kb, controlling basal branching and ear phenotypes, respectively 7. However, the causative mutations contributing to the role of maize tb1 in domestication are still unknown.The tb1 region of maize inbred line B73 was characterized previously (accession number: AF464738) 8. We constructed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries for teosinte (Zea mays ssp. Parviglumis, PI384061) and two maize inbred lines (Yu87-1 and W22). BAC clones containing the tb1 region were isolated and sequenced (Supplementary information, Data S1).A comparative analysis indicated that a long stretch of sequences surrounding the tb1 coding region is highly conserved between maize and teosinte haplotypes (Figure 1). From 58 kb upstream to 5 kb downstream (the end of the sequenced maize BAC clones), the teosinte and maize haplotypes are highly conserved, except for an LTR retrotransposon inserted in maize haplotype about 13 kb upstream of the tb1 coding region.Figure 1Sequence alignment of tb1 region from maize inbred lines B73, W22, Yu87–1. and Zea mays ssp. Parviglumis (PI 384061). Grey areas indicate homologous regions. Green bars indicate retrotransposon and blue bars indicate DNA transposons. Tb1 gene is indicated by red bars. Regulatory region of tb1 is indicated by orange bars. Insertion polymorphism of TEs between maize and teosinte are highlighted. All sequences are drawn to scale.Full size imageAt 58-69 kb upstream is a critical region previously identified as the causal region for the cis-regulatory element changes to tb1 during maize domestication 7. Three major polymorphisms were found in this region, including a 4 884-bp copia-type LTR retrotransposon inserted in the maize haplotype at 58 858 bp upstream, a 379-bp miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) inserted in the maize haplotype at 64 461 bp upstream, and a 200-bp insertion present in the teosinte haplotype. The LTR retrotransposon has 227-bp LTRs and shares 99% identity (with only a 2-nucleotide difference), indicating that it was inserted recently. Further beyond 69 kb upstream, the sequence conservation started to drop dramatically, not only between the teosinte and maize haplotypes but also between maize haplotypes (Figure 1).We further examined the 58-69 kb upstream region in detail by sequence analysis of additional maize and teosinte lines (Supplementary information, Figures S1 and S2). Sequence comparison of these maize and teosinte lines indicated that, except for the two TEs mentioned above, all other sequence polymorphisms failed to show an association with the maize lines and therefore were disqualified as the causative mutations for the maize tb1 allele. The two TEs in the maize haplotypes appeared to be the only polymorphisms that could potentially be the causative mutations for the maize tb1 allele.To test this hypothesis, a maize association panel with 539 diverse lines (Supplementary information, Data S1, Table S1) and an extensive teosinte collection with 189 accessions were used for further association analysis (Supplementary information, Data S1, Table S2).PCR products corresponding to the LTR retrotransposon insertion were detected in all 539 maize lines. Of these lines, 498 were detected using a primer set spanning the entire retrotransposon, whereas 41 were detected by a primer set bridging one end of the retrotransposon and the adjacent sequence (Supplementary information, Figure S3, Table S1). In teosinte, 174 of 189 accessions yielded PCR products without the TE insertion. Fourteen accessions were heterozygous for PCR products with both maize and teosinte haplotypes (Supplementary information, Figure S3, Table S2). One accession failed to yield any amplification product with the different primer sets.All 539 maize lines showed a predicted 660-bp product corresponding to the MITE insertion. In teosinte, 163 of 189 accessions showed products lacking the MITE insertion. The remaining 26 accessions were heterozygous for the PCR products, with both maize and teosinte haplotypes (Supplementary information, Figure S3, Tables S1 and S2). In summary, both the LTR retrotransposon and the MITE showed exclusive association with all tested maize lines.A previous genetic study revealed that the causative mutations for domestication in maize tb1 are contained within a region located 58-69 kb upstream 7. Our comparative genomics and association analysis revealed that the two TEs are the only polymorphisms associated with domesticated maize lines in this region. The exclusive association of the TEs with domesticated maize lines is in consistent with the strong selection for the domesticated trait controlled by the maize tb1 gene. The maize domestication process selected for single-stalked maize against multi-tillered teosinte; this trait is controlled by the single locus tb1, and the maize tb1 allele behaves as dominant to the teosinte allele. The selection for the single-stalked trait was apparent and unambiguous, suggesting that the trait was under perfect selection during maize domestication.Previous characterization of the 58-69 kb upstream region indicated the existence of two independent functional components 7. These two independent components, located 64-69 kb and 58-64 kb upstream of the maize tb1 allele, control maize basal branching and ear phenotype changes, respectively. The insertion positions of the two TEs correspond with these two functional components. The two TEs are the only maize-associated mutations within these two components, so they should be responsible for the functional changes. The observed functions of these two regulatory components also indicate that the insertions of these two TEs did not disrupt the preexisting regulatory functions (losses of function) but rather added new regulatory functions (gains of function). These gains of function are consistent with the genetic characteristics of the maize tb1 allele as being dominant to the teosinte allele. Because they contributed new regulatory functions to the targeted gene, these two TEs are recognized as “domesticated” or “exapted” 1.According to the previous functional characterization 7, the observed function of the 64-69 kb upstream component in maize is to suppress basal branching. Based on the biological function of the tb1 gene 4, we predict that the mutation in this component may confer a quantitative increase in the expression of the maize tb1 allele. This increased expression is consistent with the potential effect of the MITE inserted within this component. It is well documented that MITEs inserted upstream of a gene often result in up-regulated gene expression 9. Because the 58-64 kb upstream component affected the ear phenotype in maize, we predict that the mutation in this component may confer a change in the tissue specificity of tb1 gene expression. It is known that LTR retrotransposon insertion can change the tissue-specific expression of an adjacent gene 10. Therefore, the LTR retrotransposon inserted in the 58-64 kb component may be responsible for the change in tissue specificity of the maize tb1 allele. Of course, the predicted functions of these TEs require further experimental verification.We also observed a limited distribution of haplotypes with these two TEs among the teosinte accessions (26 accessions for the MITE and 14 accessions for the LTR retrotransposon). These accessions all belonged to the subspecies Parviglumis and Mexicana, the two subspecies closest to cultivated maize. The presence of these TEs among teosinte accessions cannot simply be explained by cross-contamination of maize haplotypes with teosinte accessions. Only 7 accessions contained possible maize haplotype contamination with both the MITE and the LTR retrotransposon. The majority had either the MITE (19 accessions) or the LTR retrotransposon (7 accessions). We propose that the MITE and LTR resulted from two independent transpositions in teosinte that predated maize domestication and that these two TEs were coupled through hybridization and recombination between different teosinte haplotypes harboring one of the two TEs. Then the domestication selection fixed both TEs in modern maize haplotypes.The change in the regulation of the tb1 gene during maize domestication was subtle and sophisticated 4, 7. It is difficult to achieve such a change by accumulating only point mutations. However, TEs containing one or more cis-regulatory elements can move to a new location by a single transposition and thereby add new regulatory functions to the targeted gene, speeding up a process that could have required million years of evolution without the TE. In this manner, TEs could greatly accelerate the evolution of the host genome in response to sudden challenges 11. If the host were to encounter a critical crisis, reactivation of many silenced TEs stored in the genome may enhance the host's chance of survival by quickly evolving new gene-regulatory functions in a short time period. In view of the great abundance of TEs and their global distribution within eukaryotic genomes, the impact of TEs and their activities on the evolution of gene regulation and function could exceed our previous estimates. Such mechanisms involving TEs could theoretically explain some of the extraordinary biological diversity observed in nature and could provide new opportunities for genetic breeding with exhausted genetic resources.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr2011104"
"cr","Efficient human iPS cell derivation by a non-integrating plasmid from blood cells with unique epigenetic and gene expression signatures","To identify accessible and permissive human cell types for efficient derivation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we investigated epigenetic and gene expression signatures of multiple postnatal cell types such as fibroblasts and blood cells. Our analysis suggested that newborn cord blood (CB) and adult peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (MNCs) display unique signatures that are closer to iPSCs and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) than age-matched fibroblasts to iPSCs/ESCs, thus making blood MNCs an attractive cell choice for the generation of integration-free iPSCs. Using an improved EBNA1/OriP plasmid expressing 5 reprogramming factors, we demonstrated highly efficient reprogramming of briefly cultured blood MNCs. Within 14 days of one-time transfection by one plasmid, up to 1000 iPSC-like colonies per 2 million transfected CB MNCs were generated. The efficiency of deriving iPSCs from adult PB MNCs was approximately 50-fold lower, but could be enhanced by inclusion of a second EBNA1/OriP plasmid for transient expression of additional genes such as SV40 T antigen. The duration of obtaining bona fide iPSC colonies from adult PB MNCs was reduced to half (∼14 days) as compared to adult fibroblastic cells (28–30 days). More than 9 human iPSC lines derived from PB or CB blood cells are extensively characterized, including those from PB MNCs of an adult patient with sickle cell disease. They lack V(D)J DNA rearrangements and vector DNA after expansion for 10–12 passages. This facile method of generating integration-free human iPSCs from blood MNCs will accelerate their use in both research and future clinical applications.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr201112"
"cr","Platelets generated from human embryonic stem cells are functional in vitro and in the microcirculation of living mice","Platelets play an essential role in hemostasis and atherothrombosis. Owing to their short storage time, there is constant demand for this life-saving blood component. In this study, we report that it is feasible to generate functional megakaryocytes and platelets from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) on a large scale. Differential-interference contrast and electron microscopy analyses showed that ultrastructural and morphological features of hESC-derived platelets were indistinguishable from those of normal blood platelets. In functional assays, hESC-derived platelets responded to thrombin stimulation, formed microaggregates, and facilitated clot formation/retraction in vitro. Live cell microscopy demonstrated that hESC-platelets formed lamellipodia and filopodia in response to thrombin activation, and tethered to each other as observed in normal blood. Using real-time intravital imaging with high-speed video microscopy, we have also shown that hESC-derived platelets contribute to developing thrombi at sites of laser-induced vascular injury in mice, providing the first evidence for in vivo functionality of hESC-derived platelets. These results represent an important step toward generating an unlimited supply of platelets for transfusion. Since platelets contain no genetic material, they are ideal candidates for early clinical translation involving human pluripotent stem cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/cr20118"
