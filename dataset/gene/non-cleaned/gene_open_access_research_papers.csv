"gene","Potential diagnostic biomarkers: 6 cuproptosis- and ferroptosis-related genes linking immune infiltration in acute myocardial infarction","The current diagnostic biomarkers of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), troponins, lack specificity and exist as false positives in other non-cardiac diseases. Previous studies revealed that cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and immune infiltration are all involved in the development of AMI. We hypothesize that combining the analysis of cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and immune infiltration in AMI will help identify more precise diagnostic biomarkers. The results showed that a total of 19 cuproptosis- and ferroptosis-related genes (CFRGs) were differentially expressed between the healthy and AMI groups. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the differential CFRGs were mostly enriched in biological processes related to oxidative stress and the inflammatory response. The immune infiltration status analyzed by ssGSEA found elevated levels of macrophages, neutrophils, and CCR in AMI. Then, we screened 6 immune-related CFRGs (CXCL2, DDIT3, DUSP1, CDKN1A, TLR4, STAT3) to construct a nomogram for predicting AMI and validated it in the GSE109048 dataset. Moreover, we also identified 5 pivotal miRNAs and 10 candidate drugs that target the 6 feature genes. Finally, RT-qPCR analysis verified that all 6 feature genes were upregulated in both animals and patients. In conclusion, our study reveals the significance of immune-related CFRGs in AMI and provides new insights for AMI diagnosis and treatment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-023-00209-8"
"gene","αCGRP deficiency aggravates pulmonary fibrosis by activating the PPARγ signaling pathway","In order to explore whether αCGRP (Calca) deficiency aggravates pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Clinical data from patients with PF (n = 52) were retrospectively analyzed. Lung tissue from a bleomycin (BLM)-induced rat model was compared with that of Calca-knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) using immunohistochemistry, RNA-seq, and UPLC-MS/MS metabolomic analyses. The results showed that decreased αCGRP expression and activation of the type 2 immune response were detected in patients with PF. In BLM-induced and Calca-KO rats, αCGRP deficiency potentiated apoptosis of AECs and induced M2 macrophages. RNA-seq identified enrichment of pathways involved in nuclear translocation and immune system disorders in Calca-KO rats compared to WT. Mass spectrometry of lung tissue from Calca-KO rats showed abnormal lipid metabolism, including increased levels of LTB4, PDX, 1-HETE. PPAR pathway signaling was significantly induced in both transcriptomic and metabolomic datasets in Calca-KO rats, and immunofluorescence analysis confirmed that the nuclear translocation of PPARγ in BLM-treated and Calca-KO rats was synchronized with STAT6 localization in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. In conclusion, αCGRP is protective against PF, and αCGRP deficiency promotes M2 polarization of macrophages, probably by activating the PPARγ pathway, which leads to activation of the type 2 immune response and accelerates PF development.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-023-00206-x"
"gene","IgE-binding monocytes upregulate the coagulation cascade in allergic horses","IgE-binding monocytes are a rare peripheral immune cell type involved in the allergic response through binding of IgE on their surface. IgE-binding monocytes are present in both healthy and allergic individuals. We performed RNA sequencing to ask how the function of IgE-binding monocytes differs in the context of allergy. Using a large animal model of allergy, equine Culicoides hypersensitivity, we compared the transcriptome of IgE-binding monocytes in allergic and non-allergic horses at two seasonal timepoints: (i) when allergic animals were clinical healthy, in the winter “Remission Phase”, and (ii) during chronic disease, in the summer “Clinical Phase”. Most transcriptional differences between allergic and non-allergic horses occurred only during the “Remission Phase”, suggesting principal differences in monocyte function even in the absence of allergen exposure. F13A1, a subunit of fibrinoligase, was significantly upregulated at both timepoints in allergic horses. This suggested a role for increased fibrin deposition in the coagulation cascade to promote allergic inflammation. IgE-binding monocytes also downregulated CCR10 expression in allergic horses during the “Clinical Phase”, suggesting a defect in maintenance of skin homeostasis, which further promotes allergic inflammation. Together, this transcriptional analysis provides valuable clues into the mechanisms used by IgE-binding monocytes in allergic individuals.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-023-00207-w"
"gene","Identification of heat shock protein family A member 5 (HSPA5) targets involved in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease","Heat shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 5 (HSPA5) is an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, which regulates cell metabolism, particularly lipid metabolism. While HSPA5’s role in regulating cell function is well described, HSPA5 binding to RNA and its biological function in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is still lacking. In the present study, the ability of HSPA5 to modulate alternative splicing (AS) of cellular genes was assessed using Real-Time PCR on 89 NAFLD-associated genes. RNA immunoprecipitation coupled to RNA sequencing (RIP-Seq) assays were also performed to identify cellular mRNAs bound by HSPA5. We obtained the HSPA5-bound RNA profile in HeLa cells and peak calling analysis revealed that HSPA5 binds to coding genes and lncRNAs. Moreover, RIP-Seq assays demonstrated that HSPA5 immunoprecipitates specific cellular mRNAs such as EGFR, NEAT1, LRP1 and TGFß1, which are important in the pathology of NAFLD. Finally, HSPA5 binding sites may be associated with splicing sites. We used the HOMER algorithm to search for motifs enriched in coding sequence (CDs) peaks, which identified over-representation of the AGAG motif in both sets of immunoprecipitated peaks. HSPA5 regulated genes at the 5′UTR alternative splicing and introns and in an AG-rich sequence-dependent manner. We propose that the HSPA5-AGAG interaction might play an important role in regulating alternative splicing of NAFLD-related genes. This report is the first to demonstrate that HSPA5 regulated pre-RNA alternative splicing, stability, or translation and affected target protein(s) via binding to lncRNA and mRNA linked to NAFLD.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-023-00205-y"
"gene","Modulation of immune checkpoint regulators in interferon γ induced urothelial carcinoma and activated T-lymphocyte cells by cytostatics","Exploring the regulation of co-inhibitory (PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4) and co-stimulatory (CD28) genes by chemotherapeutic drugs is important for combined immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. ICB interferes with T-cell receptor and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) signaling by antibody drugs directed against the co-inhibitors. Here, we analyzed urothelial (T24) cell line with respect to cytokine signaling by interferon γ (IFNG) and the leukemia lymphocyte (Jurkat) cell line with respect to T-cell activation as mimicked by phorbolester and calcium ionophore (pma/iono). Alongside, we considered possible intervention with the chemotherapeutics gemcitabine, cisplatin and vinflunine. Noteworthy, cisplatin significantly induced PD-L1-mRNA in naïve and IFNG treated cells whereas gemcitabine and vinflunine had no effect on PD-L1-mRNA. At the protein level, PD-L1 showed typical induction in IFNG treated cells. In Jurkat cells, cisplatin significantly induced PD-1-mRNA and PD-L1-mRNA. Pma/iono administration did not alter PD-1-mRNA and PD-L1-mRNA but significantly increased CTLA-4-mRNA and CD28-mRNA levels where vinflunine suppressed the CD28-mRNA induction. In sum, we demonstrated that certain cytostatic drugs being relevant for the therapy of urothelial cancer, affect co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory modulators of immune signaling with potential impact for perspective combined ICB therapy of patients.
"gene","Long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3, miR-125a-5p, CXCL13, and NF-kB in patients with immune thrombocytopenia","The main aim of this study was to assess the expression level of circulating long non-coding RNA maternally expressed gene 3 (lncRNA-MEG3), microRNA (miR-125a-5P), the chemokine C-X-C motif ligand13 (CXCL13), and the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) cases and to study its relation to the disease severity and treatment response. This case-control study included 45 patients newly diagnosed as ITP and 45 healthy subjects. We assessed complete blood count, antinuclear antibodies, hepatitis B and C virus serology, lncRNA-MEG3, miR-125a-5P, and CXCL13 expression in serum by real-time PCR and NF-kb protein by ELISA. In ITP patients compared to control, lncRNA-MEG3 was significantly increased, and miRNA-125a-5P was decreased, and this was associated with higher CXCL13 and NF-kB levels (P < 0.001, for all).There was a significant negative correlation between platelet count and lncRNA-MEG3, CXCL13, and NF-kb, while a positive correlation with miR-125a-5p in ITP patients. Patients who responded to steroids had significantly higher miR-125a-5p (P = 0.016) and significantly lower lncRNA-MEG3 (P < 0.001), CXCL13 (P = 0.005), and NF-kb (p = 0.002). Based on the ROC curves, lncRNA-MEG3 displayed the highest area under the curve (AUC) in the identification of organ bleeding (AUC = 0.805), the response to steroids (AUC = 0.853), and the need for splenectomy (AUC = 0.75).","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-023-00200-3"
"gene","Slc11a1 gene polymorphism influences dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in a murine model of acute inflammation","Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease characterized by colonic mucosal lesions associated with an increased risk of carcinogenesis. UC pathogenesis involves environmental and genetic factors. Genetic studies have indicated the association of gene variants coding for the divalent metal ion transporter SLC11A1 protein (formerly NRAMP1) with UC susceptibility in several animal species. Two mouse lines were genetically selected for high (AIRmax) or low (AIRmin) acute inflammatory responses (AIR). AIRmax is susceptible, and AIRmin is resistant to DSS-induced colitis and colon carcinogenesis. Furthermore, AIRmin mice present polymorphism of the Slc11a1 gene. Here we investigated the possible modulating effect of the Slc11a1 R and S variants in DSS-induced colitis by using AIRmin mice homozygous for Slc11a1 R (AIRminRR) or S (AIRminSS) alleles. We evaluated UC by the disease activity index (DAI), considering weight loss, diarrhea, blood in the anus or feces, cytokines, histopathology, and cell populations in the distal colon epithelium. AIRminSS mice have become susceptible to DSS effects, with higher DAI, IL6, G-CSF, and MCP-1 production and morphological and colon histopathological alterations than AIRminRR mice. The results point to a role of the Slc11a1 S allele in DSS colitis induction in the genetic background of AIRmin mice.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-023-00199-7"
"gene","Human lung carcinomas synthesize immunoregulatory glucocorticoids","The need for new options in lung cancer treatment inevitably leads back to basic research. The tumor itself and the tumor environment especially the interaction with the immune system need to be better understood to develop targeted therapies. In the context of lung cancer glucocorticoids (GC) are mainly known as a combination drug to attenuate side-effects of chemotherapies. However, endogenous extra-adrenal GC have been shown to substantially regulate local immune responses within various tissues, including the lung. In this study we investigated whether primary lung tumors have maintained the capacity to synthesize GC and may thereby regulate anti-tumor immune responses. We show that several non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) and small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) cell lines express key steroidogenic enzymes and synthesize bioactive GC under steady state conditions. We also show that tumor-derived GC can inhibit splenic T cell activation, thus demonstrating their immunoregulatory potential. Moreover, steroidogenic enzymes were detected by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry in tissue sections of different human lung tumors, further strengthening the idea that human lung carcinomas regulate their microenvironment by releasing immunoregulatory GC, which potentially contributes to immune evasion and treatment resistance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-023-00194-y"
"gene","Significance of HLA in the development of Graves’ orbitopathy","Graves’ disease (GD), similarly to most autoimmune disease, is triggered by environmental factors in genetically predisposed individuals. Particular HLA alleles increase or decrease GD risk. No such correlation was demonstrated for Graves’ orbitopathy (GO) in Caucasian population. HLA-A, -B, -C, -DQB1 and -DRB1 genotyping was performed using a high-resolution method in a total number of 2378 persons including 70 patients with GO, 91 patients with non-GO GD and 2217 healthy controls to compare allele frequencies between GO, non-GO and controls. Significant associations between GO and HLA profile were demonstrated, with HLA-A*01:01, -A*32:01, -B*37:01, -B*39:01, -B*42:01, -C*08:02, C*03:02, DRB1*03:01, DRB1*14:01 and DQB1*02:01 being genetic markers of increased risk of GO, and HLA-C*04:01, -C*03:04, -C*07:02 and -DRB1*15:02 being protective alleles. Moreover, correlations between HLA alleles and increased or decreased risk of non-GO GD, but with no impact on risk of GO development, were revealed. Identification of these groups of GO-related and GO-protective alleles, as well as the alleles strongly related to non-GO GD, constitutes an important step in a development of personalized medicine, with individual risk assessment and patient-tailored treatment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-023-00193-z"
"gene","Gene–environment interactions and their impact on human health","The molecular processes underlying human health and disease are highly complex. Often, genetic and environmental factors contribute to a given disease or phenotype in a non-additive manner, yielding a gene–environment (G × E) interaction. In this work, we broadly review current knowledge on the impact of gene–environment interactions on human health. We first explain the independent impact of genetic variation and the environment. We next detail well-established G × E interactions that impact human health involving environmental toxicants, pollution, viruses, and sex chromosome composition. We conclude with possibilities and challenges for studying G × E interactions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-022-00192-6"

"gene","Genotype–phenotype correlations in WHIM syndrome: a systematic characterization of CXCR4WHIM variants","Warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, myelokathexis (WHIM) syndrome is a rare primary immunodeficiency predominantly caused by heterozygous gain-of-function mutations in CXCR4 C-terminus. We assessed genotype–phenotype correlations for known pathogenic CXCR4 variants and in vitro response of each variant to mavorixafor, an investigational CXCR4 antagonist. We used cell-based assays to analyze CXCL12-induced receptor trafficking and downstream signaling of 14 pathogenic CXCR4 variants previously identified in patients with WHIM syndrome. All CXCR4 variants displayed impaired receptor trafficking, hyperactive downstream signaling, and enhanced chemotaxis in response to CXCL12. Mavorixafor inhibited CXCL12-dependent signaling and hyperactivation in cells harboring CXCR4WHIM mutations. A strong correlation was found between CXCR4 internalization defect and severity of blood leukocytopenias and infection susceptibility, and between AKT activation and immunoglobulin A level and CD4+ T-cell counts. This study is the first to show WHIM syndrome clinical phenotype variability as a function of both CXCR4WHIM genotype diversity and associated functional dysregulation. Our findings suggest that CXCR4 internalization may be used to assess the pathogenicity of CXCR4 variants in vitro and also as a potential WHIM-related disease biomarker. The investigational CXCR4 antagonist mavorixafor inhibited CXCL12-dependent signaling in all tested CXCR4-variant cell lines at clinically relevant concentrations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-022-00181-9"
"gene","Single-cell immune repertoire sequencing of B and T cells in murine models of infection and autoimmunity","Adaptive immune repertoires are composed by the ensemble of B and T-cell receptors within an individual, reflecting both past and current immune responses. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing enable recovery of the complete adaptive immune receptor sequences in addition to transcriptional information. Here, we recovered transcriptome and immune repertoire information for polyclonal T follicular helper cells following lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection, CD8+ T cells with binding specificity restricted to two distinct LCMV peptides, and B and T cells isolated from the nervous system in the context of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. We could relate clonal expansion, germline gene usage, and clonal convergence to cell phenotypes spanning activation, memory, naive, antibody secretion, T-cell inflation, and regulation. Together, this dataset provides a resource for immunologists that can be integrated with future single-cell immune repertoire and transcriptome sequencing datasets.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-022-00180-w"
"gene","RALY regulate the proliferation and expression of immune/inflammatory response genes via alternative splicing of FOS","RALY is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein involved in cancer metastasis, prognosis, and chemotherapy resistance in various cancers. However, the molecular mechanism of which is still unclear. We have established RALY overexpression cell lines and studied the effect of RALY on proliferation and apoptosis in HeLa cells. Then we used RNA-seq to analyze the transcriptomes data. Lastly, RT-qPCR experiments had performed to confirm the RNA-seq results. We found that the overexpression of RALY in HeLa cells inhibited proliferation. Moreover, the overexpression of RALY changed the gene expression profile, and the significant upregulation of genes involved immune/inflammatory response related biological process by NOD-like receptor signaling pathway cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. The significant downregulation genes involved innate immune response by the Primary immunodeficiency pathway. Notably, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFTI3, IFI44, HERC4, and OASL expression had inhibited by the overexpression of RALY. Furthermore, RALY negatively regulates the expression of transcription factors FOS and FOSB. Notably, we found that 645 alternative splicing events had regulated by overexpression of RALY, which is highly enriched in transcription regulation, RNA splicing, and cell proliferation biological process by the metabolic pathway. We show that RALY regulates the expression of immune/inflammatory response-related genes via alternative splicing of FOS in HeLa cells. The novel role of RALY in regulating immune/inflammatory gene expression may explain its function in regulating chemotherapy resistance and provides novel insights into further exploring the molecular mechanism of RALY in regulating cancer immunity and chemo/immune therapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-022-00178-4"
"gene","Fc receptors and the diversity of antibody responses to HIV infection and vaccination","The development of an effective vaccine against HIV is desperately needed. The successive failures of HIV vaccine efficacy trials in recent decades have shown the difficulty of inducing an appropriate protective immune response to fight HIV. Different correlates of antibody parameters associated with a decreased risk of HIV-1 acquisition have been identified. However, these parameters are difficult to reproduce and improve, possibly because they have an intricate and combined action. Here, we describe the numerous antibody (Ab) functions associated with HIV-1 protection and report the interrelated parameters regulating their complex functions. Indeed, besides neutralizing and Fc-mediated activity, additional factors such as Ab type, concentration and kinetics of induction, and Fc-receptor expression and binding capacity also influence the protective effect conferred by Abs. As these parameters were described to be associated with ethnicity, age and sex, these additional factors must be considered for the development of an effective immune response. Therefore, future vaccine designs need to consider these multifaceted Ab functions together with the demographic attributes of the patient populations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-022-00175-7"
"gene","Macrophage-mediated anti-tumor immunity against high-risk neuroblastoma","Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial childhood solid tumor. The majority of high-risk neuroblastoma is resistant/refractory to the current high intensity therapy. Neuroblastoma lacks classical HLA Class I expression and exhibits low mutation burden, allowing neuroblastoma cells to evade CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity. Neuroblastoma cells do not express PD-L1, and tumor-associated macrophages are the predominant PD-L1+ cells in the tumor. In this study, we performed gene expression profiling and survival analyses on large neuroblastoma datasets to address the prognostic effect of PD-L1 gene expression and the possible involvement of the SLAMF7 pathway in the anti-neuroblastoma immunity. High-level expression of PD-L1 was found significantly associated with better outcome of high-risk neuroblastoma patients; two populations of PD-1+ PD-L1+ macrophages could be present in high-risk tumors with PD-1/PD-L1 ratios, ≈1 and >1. Patients with the PD-1/PD-L1 ratio >1 tumor showed inferior survival. High-level co-expression of SLAMF7 and SH2D1B was significantly associated with better survival of the high-risk neuroblastoma patients. Together, this study supports the hypothesis that macrophages are important effector cells in the anti-high-risk neuroblastoma immunity, that PD-1 blockade therapy can be beneficial to the high-risk neuroblastoma subset with the PD-1/PD-L1 expression ratio >1, and that SLAMF7 is a new therapeutic target of high-risk neuroblastoma.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-022-00172-w"
"gene","pmTR database: population matched (pm) germline allelic variants of T-cell receptor (TR) loci","The IMGT database profiles the TR germline alleles for all four TR loci (TRA, TRB, TRG and TRD), however, it does not comprise of the information regarding population specificity and allelic frequencies of these germline alleles. The specificity of allelic variants to different human populations can, however, be a rich source of information when studying the genetic basis of population-specific immune responses in disease and in vaccination. Therefore, we meticulously identified true germline alleles enriched with complete TR allele sequences and their frequencies across 26 different human populations, profiled by “1000 Genomes data”. We identified 205 TRAV, 249 TRBV, 16 TRGV and 5 TRDV germline alleles supported by at least four haplotypes. The diversity of germline allelic variants in the TR loci is the highest in Africans, while the majority of the Non-African alleles are specific to the Asian populations, suggesting a diverse profile of TR germline alleles in different human populations. Interestingly, the alleles in the IMGT database are frequent and common across all five super-populations. We believe that this new set of germline TR sequences represents a valuable new resource which we have made available through the new population-matched TR (pmTR) database, accessible via https://pmtrig.lumc.nl/.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-022-00171-x"
"gene","Rhesus negative males have an enhanced IFNγ-mediated immune response to influenza A virus","The Rhesus D antigen (RhD) has been associated with susceptibility to several viral infections. Reports suggest that RhD-negative individuals are better protected against infectious diseases and have overall better health. However, potential mechanisms contributing to these associations have not yet been defined. Here, we used transcriptomic and genomic data from the Milieu Interieur cohort of 1000 healthy individuals to explore the effect of Rhesus status on the immune response. We used the rs590787 SNP in the RHD gene to classify the 1000 donors as either RhD-positive or -negative. Whole blood was stimulated with LPS, polyIC, and the live influenza A virus and the NanoString human immunology panel of 560 genes used to assess donor immune response and to investigate sex-specific effects. Using regression analysis, we observed no significant differences in responses to polyIC or LPS between RhD-positive and -negative individuals. However, upon sex-specific analysis, we observed over 40 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between RhD-positive (n = 384) and RhD-negative males (n = 75) after influenza virus stimulation. Interestingly these Rhesus-associated differences were not seen in females. Further investigation, using gene set enrichment analysis, revealed enhanced IFNγ signalling in RhD-negative males. This amplified IFNγ signalling axis may explain the increased viral resistance previously described in RhD-negative individuals.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-022-00169-5"
"gene","Progress in the genetics of uveitis","Uveitis is the most common form of intraocular inflammatory disease and is a significant cause of visual impairment worldwide. Aetiologically, uveitis can also be classified into infectious uveitis and non-infectious uveitis. The common non-infectious forms of uveitis include acute anterior uveitis (AAU), Behçet’s disease (BD), Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease, birdshot chorioretinopathy (BSCR), sarcoid uveitis. In addition, a few monogenic autoinflammatory disorders can also cause uveitis, such as Blau Syndrome and haploinsufficiency of A20 (HA20). Although the exact pathogenesis of non-infectious uveitis is still unclear, it is well-recognised that it involves both genetic and environmental risk factors. A hallmark of uveitis is its strong associations with human leucocyte antigens (HLA). For examples, AAU, BD and BSCR are strongly associated with HLA-B27, HLA-B51, and HLA-A29, respectively. In uveitis studies, multiple GWAS have successfully been conducted and led to identification of novel susceptibility loci, for example, IL23R has been identified in BD, VKH and AAU. In this review, we summarize the latest progress on the genetic associations of both HLA and non-HLA genes with major forms of uveitis, including AAU, BD, VKH, BSCR, sarcoid uveitis, Blau Syndrome and HA20, and potential future research directions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-022-00168-6"
"gene","Identification of a novel MAGT1 mutation supports a diagnosis of XMEN disease","XMEN (X-linked immunodeficiency with magnesium defect) is caused by loss-of-function mutations in MAGT1 which is encoded on the X chromosome. The disorder is characterised by CD4 lymphopenia, severe chronic viral infections and defective T-lymphocyte activation. XMEN patients are susceptible to Epstein-Barr virus infections and persistently low levels of intracellular Mg2+. Here we describe a patient that presented with multiple recurrent infections and a subsequent diffuse B-cell lymphoma. Molecular genetic analysis by exome sequencing identified a novel hemizygous MAGT1 nonsense mutation c.1005T>A (NM_032121.5) p.(Cys335*), confirming a diagnosis of XMEN deficiency. Follow-up immunophenotyping was performed by antibody staining and flow cytometry; proliferation was determined by 3H-thymidine uptake after activation by PHA and anti-CD3. Cytotoxic natural killer cell activity was assessed with K562 target cells using the NKTESTTM assay. While lymphocyte populations were superficially intact, B cells were largely naive with a reduced memory cell compartment. Translated NKG2D was absent on both NK and T cells in the proband, and normally expressed in the carrier mother. In vitro NK cell activity was intact in both the proband and his mother. This report adds to the growing number of identified XMEN cases, raising awareness of a, still rare, X-linked immunodeficiency.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-022-00166-8"
"gene","Synergy between TMZ and individualized multimodal immunotherapy to improve overall survival of IDH1 wild-type MGMT promoter-unmethylated GBM patients","The prognosis of IDH1 wild-type MGMT promoter-unmethylated GBM patients remains poor. Addition of Temozolomide (TMZ) to first-line local treatment shifted the median overall survival (OS) from 11.8 to 12.6 months. We retrospectively analyzed the value of individualized multimodal immunotherapy (IMI) to improve OS in these patients. All adults meeting the criteria and treated 06/2015–06/2021 were selected. Thirty-two patients (12f, 20m) had a median age of 47 y (range 18–69) and a KPI of 70 (50–100). Extent of resection was complete (11), <complete (12) or not documented (9). Seven patients were treated with surgery/radio(chemo)therapy and subsequent IMI (Group-1); 25 patients were treated with radiochemotherapy followed by maintenance TMZ plus IMI during and after TMZ (Group-2). Age, KPI and extent of resection were not different amongst both groups. The median OS of group-1 patients was 11 m (2 y OS: 0%). Surprisingly the median OS of group-2 patients was 22 m with 2 y OS of 36% (CI95%: 16–57), which was significantly (Log-rank: p = 0.0001) different from group-1. The data suggest that addition of IMI after local therapy on its own has no relevant effect on OS in these GBM patients, similar to maintenance TMZ. However, the combination of both TMZ + IMI significantly improved OS.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-022-00162-y"
"gene","Distinct molecular phenotypes involving several human diseases are induced by IFN-λ3 and IFN-λ4 in monocyte-derived macrophages","Human Interferon (IFN) lambda 3 (IFN-λ3) and IFN-λ4 are closely linked at the IFNL locus and show association with several diseases in genetic studies. Since they are only ~30% identical to each other, to better understand their roles in disease phenotypes, comparative studies are needed. Monocytes are precursors to macrophages (monocyte-derived macrophages; MDMs) that get differentiated under the influence of various immune factors, including IFNs. In a recent study, we characterized lipopolysaccharide-activated M1 and M2-MDMs that were differentiated in presence of IFN-λ3 or IFN-λ4. In this study, we performed transcriptomics on these M1 and M2-MDMs to further understand their molecular phenotypes. We identified over 760 genes that were reciprocally regulated by IFN-λ3 and IFN-λ4, additionally we identified over 240 genes that are significantly affected by IFN-λ4 but not IFN-λ3. We observed that IFN-λ3 was more active in M2-MDMs while IFN-λ4 showed superior response in M1-MDMs. Providing a structural explanation for these functional differences, molecular modeling showed differences in expected interactions of IFN-λ3 and IFN-λ4 with the extracellular domain of IFN-λR1. Further, pathway analysis showed several human infectious diseases and even cancer-related pathways being significantly affected by IFN-λ3 and/or IFN-λ4 in both M1 and M2-MDMs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-022-00164-w"
"gene","Immunogenic cell death and its therapeutic or prognostic potential in high-grade glioma","Immunogenic cell death (ICD) has emerged as a key component of therapy-induced anti-tumor immunity. Over the past few years, ICD was found to play a pivotal role in a wide variety of novel and existing treatment modalities. The clinical application of these techniques in cancer treatment is still in its infancy. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most lethal primary brain tumor with a dismal prognosis despite maximal therapy. The development of new therapies in this aggressive type of tumors remains highly challenging partially due to the cold tumor immune environment. GBM could therefore benefit from ICD-based therapies stimulating the anti-tumor immune response. In what follows, we will describe the mechanisms behind ICD and the ICD-based (pre)clinical advances in anticancer therapies focusing on GBM.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00161-5"
"gene","Mapping of novel loci involved in lung and colon tumor susceptibility by the use of genetically selected mouse strains","Two non-inbred mouse lines, phenotypically selected for maximal (AIRmin) and minimal (AIRmax) acute inflammatory response, show differential susceptibility/resistance to the development of several chemically-induced tumor types. An intercross pedigree of these mice was generated and treated with the chemical carcinogen dimethylhydrazine, which induces lung and intestinal tumors. Genome wide high-density genotyping with the Restriction Site-Associated DNA genotyping (2B-RAD) technique was used to map genetic loci modulating individual genetic susceptibility to both lung and intestinal cancer. Our results evidence new common quantitative trait loci (QTL) for those phenotypes and provide an improved understanding of the relationship between genomic variation and individual genetic predisposition to tumorigenesis in different organs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00159-z"
"gene","Rare variants in Toll-like receptor 7 results in functional impairment and downregulation of cytokine-mediated signaling in COVID-19 patients","Toll-like receptors (TLR) are crucial components in the initiation of innate immune responses to a variety of pathogens, triggering the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I and II interferons, which are responsible for innate antiviral responses. Among the different TLRs, TLR7 recognizes several single-stranded RNA viruses including SARS-CoV-2. We and others identified rare loss-of-function variants in X-chromosomal TLR7 in young men with severe COVID-19 and with no prior history of major chronic diseases, that were associated with impaired TLR7 signaling as well as type I and II IFN responses. Here, we performed RNA sequencing to investigate transcriptome variations following imiquimod stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients carrying previously identified hypomorphic, hypofunctional, and loss-of-function TLR7 variants. Our investigation revealed a profound impairment of the TLR7 pathway in patients carrying loss-of-function variants. Of note, a failure in IFNγ upregulation following stimulation was also observed in cells harboring the hypofunctional and hypomorphic variants. We also identified new TLR7 variants in severely affected male patients for which a functional characterization of the TLR7 pathway was performed demonstrating a decrease in mRNA levels in the IFNα, IFNγ, RSAD2, ACOD1, IFIT2, and CXCL10 genes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00157-1"

"gene","Population-specific diversity of the immunoglobulin constant heavy G chain (IGHG) genes","Human immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules, IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3, exhibit substantial inter-individual variation in their constant heavy chain regions, as discovered by serological methods. This polymorphism is encoded by the IGHG1, IGHG2, and IGHG3 genes and may influence antibody function. We sequenced the coding fragments of these genes in 95 European Americans, 94 African Americans, and 94 Black South Africans. Striking differences were observed between the population groups, including extremely low amino acid sequence variation in IGHG1 among South Africans, and higher IGHG2 and IGHG3 diversity in individuals of African descent compared to individuals of European descent. Molecular definition of the loci illustrates a greater level of allelic polymorphism than previously described, including the presence of common IGHG2 and IGHG3 variants that were indistinguishable serologically. Comparison of our data with the 1000 Genome Project sequences indicates overall agreement between the datasets, although some inaccuracies in the 1000 Genomes Project are likely. These data represent the most comprehensive analysis of IGHG polymorphisms across major populations, which can now be applied to deciphering their functional impact.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00156-2"
"gene","Analysis of Il36a induction by C/EBPβ via a half-CRE•C/EBP element in murine macrophages in dependence of its CpG methylation level","Interleukin-36α is a novel member of the IL-1 cytokine family that is highly expressed in epithelial tissues and several myeloid-derived cell types after induction. The transcription factor (TF) C/EBPβ binds specifically to an essential half-CRE•C/EBP motif in the Il36a promoter to induce Il36a expression upon LPS stimulation. C/EBPs regulate gene expression by binding to recognition sequences that can contain 5′-cytosine-phosphate-guanine-3′ dinucleotides (CpG), whose methylation can influence TF binding and gene expression. Herein we show that the half-CRE•C/EBP element in the Il36a promoter is differentially methylated in the murine RAW264.7 macrophage cell line and in primary murine macrophages. We demonstrate that C/EBPβ binding to the half-CRE•C/EBP element in the Il36a promoter following LPS stimulation is insensitive to CpG methylation and that methylation of the CpG in the half-CRE•C/EBP element does not alter LPS-induced Il36a promoter activity which correlated with similar Il36a mRNA copy numbers and pro-IL-36α protein amount in both cell types. Taken together, our data indicate that C/EBPβ binding to the half-CRE•C/EBP element and subsequent gene activation occurs independently of the CpG methylation status of the half-CRE•C/EBP motif and underlines the potential of C/EBPs to recognize methylated as well as unmethylated motifs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00153-5"

The burden of infectious diseases including COVID-19 are generally reported to be higher for the Indigenous people. The historical knowledge have also suggested that the indigenous populations suffer more than the general populations in the pandemic. Recently, it has been reported that the indigenous groups of Brazil have been massively affected by COVID-19. Series of studies have shown that many of the indigenous communities reached at the verge of extinction due to this pandemic. Importantly, South Asia also has several indigenous and smaller communities, that are living in isolation. Till date, despite the two consecutive waves in India, there is no report on the impact of COVID-19 for indigenous tribes. Since smaller populations experiencing drift may have greater risk of such pandemic, we have analysed Runs of Homozygosity (ROH) among South Asian populations and identified several populations with longer homozygous segments. The longer runs of homozygosity at certain genomic regions may increases the susceptibility for COVID-19. Thus, we suggest extreme careful management of this pandemic among isolated populations of South Asia.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00150-8"
"gene","Microscale communication between bacterial pathogens and the host epithelium","Pathogenic bacteria have evolved a variety of highly selective adhesins allowing these microbes to engage specific surface determinants of their eukaryotic host cells. Receptor clustering induced by the multivalent microorganisms will not only anchor the bacteria to the tissue, but will inevitably trigger host cell signaling. It has become clear, that these bacteria-initiated signaling events can be seen as a form of localized communication with host epithelial cells. Such a microscale communication can have immediate consequences in the form of changes in host cell membrane morphology or cytoskeletal organization, but can also lead to transcriptional responses and medium- and long-term alterations in cellular physiology. In this review, we will discuss several examples of this form of microscale communication between bacterial pathogens and mammalian host cells and try to delineate their downstream ramifications in the infection process. Furthermore, we will highlight recent findings that specialized pathogenic bacteria utilize the adhesin-based interaction to diffuse the short-range messenger molecule nitric oxide into the host tissue. While anti-adhesive strategies to disrupt the initial bacterial attachment have not yet translated into medical applications, the ability to interfere with the microscale communication emanating on the host side provides an unconventional approach for preventing infectious diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00149-1"

However, at the time we developed these armed forces we did not have the understanding how important the microbiome is to our health, and how these new weapons harm our own lines of defense. With the trillions of microbes that call us home, we form a strong coalition that few enemies dare to fight. However, given successes of modern medicine, we forgot to care for our most intimate friends. And the recent pandemic has further fueled germophobic habits associated with modern life. Besides frequent antibiotic exposure, poor dietary choices take a toll on our microbes that protect us from invasion of pathogens and provide us with vitamins and metabolites that are key to sustain health.

Genetic variation in genes regulating vitamin D, and regulated by vitamin D, affect MS risk. We evaluated if the expression of vitamin D responsive MS risk genes could be used to assess vitamin D response in immune cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from healthy controls and people with MS treated with dimethyl fumarate. We assayed changes in expression of vitamin D responsive MS risk (VDRMS) genes in response to treatment with 25 hydroxy vitamin D in the presence or absence of inflammatory stimuli. Expression of CYP24A1 and other VDRMS genes was significantly altered in PBMCs treated with vitamin D in the homeostatic and inflammatory models. Gene expression in MS samples had similar responses to controls, but lower initial expression of the risk genes. Vitamin D treatment abrogated these differences. Expression of CYP24A1 and other MS risk genes in blood immune cells indicate vitamin D response and could enable assessment of immunological response to vitamin D in clinical trials and on therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00144-6"
"gene","Revisiting steroidogenesis and its role in immune regulation with the advanced tools and technologies","Historically tools and technologies facilitated scientific discoveries. Steroid hormone research is not an exception. Unfortunately, the dramatic advancement of the field faded this research area and flagged it as a solved topic. However, it should have been the opposite. The area should glitter with its strong foundation and attract next-generation scientists. Over the past century, a myriad of new facts on biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, physiology and pathology of the steroid hormones was discovered. Several innovations were made and translated into life-saving treatment strategies such as synthetic steroids, and inhibitors of steroidogenesis and steroid signaling. Steroid molecules exhibit their diverse effects on cell metabolism, salt and water balance, development and function of the reproductive system, pregnancy, and immune-cell function. Despite vigorous research, the molecular basis of the immunomodulatory effect of steroids is still mysterious. The recent excitement on local extra-glandular steroidogenesis in regulating inflammation and immunity is revitalizing the topic with a new perspective. Therefore, here we review the role of steroidogenesis in regulating inflammation and immunity, discuss the unresolved questions, and how this area can bring another golden age of steroid hormone research with the development of new tools and technologies and advancement of the scientific methods.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00139-3"
"gene","Variants in BANK1 are associated with lupus nephritis of European ancestry","The genetic background of lupus nephritis (LN) has not been completely elucidated. We performed a case-only study of 2886 SLE patients, including 947 (33%) with LN. Renal biopsies were available from 396 patients. The discovery cohort (Sweden, n = 1091) and replication cohort 1 (US, n = 962) were genotyped on the Immunochip and replication cohort 2 (Denmark/Norway, n = 833) on a custom array. Patients with LN, proliferative nephritis, or LN with end-stage renal disease were compared with SLE without nephritis. Six loci were associated with LN (p < 1 × 10−4, NFKBIA, CACNA1S, ITGA1, BANK1, OR2Y, and ACER3) in the discovery cohort. Variants in BANK1 showed the strongest association with LN in replication cohort 1 (p = 9.5 × 10−4) and proliferative nephritis in a meta-analysis of discovery and replication cohort 1. There was a weak association between BANK1 and LN in replication cohort 2 (p = 0.052), and in the meta-analysis of all three cohorts the association was strengthened (p = 2.2 × 10−7). DNA methylation data in 180 LN patients demonstrated methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTL) effects between a CpG site and BANK1 variants. To conclude, we describe genetic variations in BANK1 associated with LN and evidence for genetic regulation of DNA methylation within the BANK1 locus. This indicates a role for BANK1 in LN pathogenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00142-8"

These allelic variants can be shared between or be specific to human populations. The current immunogenetics resources gather the germline alleles, however, lack the population specificity of the alleles which poses limitations for disease-association studies related to immune responses in different human populations. Therefore, we systematically identified germline alleles from 26 different human populations around the world, profiled by “1000 Genomes” data. We identified 409 IGHV, 179 IGKV, and 199 IGLV germline alleles supported by at least seven haplotypes. The diversity of germline alleles is the highest in Africans. Remarkably, the variants in the identified novel alleles show strikingly conserved patterns, the same as found in other IG databases, suggesting over-time evolutionary selection processes. We could relate the genetic variants to population-specific immune responses, e.g. IGHV1-69 for flu in Africans. The population matched IG (pmIG) resource will enhance our understanding of the SHM-related B-cell receptor selection processes in (infectious) diseases and vaccination within and between different human populations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00143-7"

Many of the factors associated with an altered risk of developing inflammatory skin disorders have also been shown to alter the composition and diversity of non-pathogenic microbial communities that inhabit the human host. While the most densely microbial populated organ is the gut, culture and non-culture-based technologies have revealed a dynamic community of bacteria, fungi, viruses and mites that exist on healthy human skin, which change during disease. In this review, we highlight some of the recent findings on the mechanisms through which microbes interact with each other on the skin and the signalling systems that mediate communication between the immune system and skin-associated microbes. In addition, we summarize the ongoing clinical studies that are targeting the microbiome in patients with skin disorders. While significant efforts are still required to decipher the mechanisms underpinning host-microbe communication relevant to skin health, it is likely that disease-related microbial communities, or Dermatypes, will help identify personalized treatments and appropriate microbial reconstitution strategies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00133-9"
"gene","Robust microbe immune recognition in the intestinal mucosa","The mammalian mucosal immune system acts as a multitasking mediator between bodily function and a vast diversity of microbial colonists. Depending on host–microbial interaction type, mucosal immune responses have distinct functions. Immunity to pathogen infection functions to limit tissue damage, clear or contain primary infection, and prevent or lower the severity of a secondary infection by conferring specific long-term adaptive immunity. Responses to nonpathogenic commensal or mutualistic microbes instead function to tolerate continuous colonization. Mucosal innate immune and epithelial cells employ a limited repertoire of innate receptors to program the adaptive immune response accordingly. Pathogen versus nonpathogen immune discrimination appears to be very robust, as most individuals successfully maintain life-long mutualism with their nonpathogenic microbiota, while mounting immune defense to pathogenic microbe infection specifically. However, the process is imperfect, which can have immunopathological consequences, but may also be exploited medically. Normally innocuous intestinal commensals in some individuals may drive serious inflammatory autoimmunity, whereas harmless vaccines can be used to fool the immune system into mounting a protective anti-pathogen immune response. In this article, we review the current knowledge on mucosal intestinal bacterial immune recognition focusing on TH17 responses and identify commonalities between intestinal pathobiont and vaccine-induced TH17 responses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00131-x"
"gene","Microbiota-mediated protection against antibiotic-resistant pathogens","Colonization by the microbiota provides one of our most effective barriers against infection by pathogenic microbes. The microbiota protects against infection by priming immune defenses, by metabolic exclusion of pathogens from their preferred niches, and through direct antimicrobial antagonism. Disruption of the microbiota, especially by antibiotics, is a major risk factor for bacterial pathogen colonization. Restoration of the microbiota through microbiota transplantation has been shown to be an effective way to reduce pathogen burden in the intestine but comes with a number of drawbacks, including the possibility of transferring other pathogens into the host, lack of standardization, and potential disruption to host metabolism. More refined methods to exploit the power of the microbiota would allow us to utilize its protective power without the drawbacks of fecal microbiota transplantation. To achieve this requires detailed understanding of which members of the microbiota protect against specific pathogens and the mechanistic basis for their effects. In this review, we will discuss the clinical and experimental evidence that has begun to reveal which members of the microbiota protect against some of the most troublesome antibiotic-resistant pathogens: Klebsiella pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Clostridioides difficile.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00129-5"

In a cohort of 914 Malian children, we genotyped functional variants IFNL4-rs368234815, IFNL4-rs117648444, and IFNL3-rs4803217 and analyzed episodes of malaria, gastrointestinal, and respiratory infections recorded at 30,626 clinic visits from birth up to 5 years of age. Compared to children with the rs368234815-TT/TT genotype (IFN-λ4-Null), rs368234815-dG allele was most strongly associated with an earlier time-to-first episode of gastrointestinal infections (p = 0.003). The risk of experiencing an infection episode during the follow-up was also significantly increased with rs368234815-dG allele, with OR = 1.53, 95%CI (1.13–2.07), p = 0.005 for gastrointestinal infections and OR = 1.30, 95%CI (1.02–1.65), p = 0.033 for malaria. All the associations for the moderately linked rs4803217 (r2 = 0.78 in this set) were weaker and lost significance after adjusting for rs368234815. We also analyzed all outcomes in relation to IFN-λ4-P70S groups. Our results implicate IFN-λ4 and not IFN-λ3 as the primary functional cause of genetic associations with increased overall risk and younger age at first clinical episodes but not with recurrence or intensity of several common pediatric infections.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-021-00127-7"
"gene","Evolutionary and structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 specific evasion of host immunity","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is spreading fast worldwide. There is a pressing need to understand how the virus counteracts host innate immune responses. Deleterious clinical manifestations of coronaviruses have been associated with virus-induced direct dysregulation of innate immune responses occurring via viral macrodomains located within nonstructural protein-3 (Nsp3). However, no substantial information is available concerning the relationship of macrodomains to the unusually high pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we show that structural evolution of macrodomains may impart a critical role to the unique pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. Using sequence, structural, and phylogenetic analysis, we identify a specific set of historical substitutions that recapitulate the evolution of the macrodomains that counteract host immune response. These evolutionary substitutions may alter and reposition the secondary structural elements to create new intra-protein contacts and, thereby, may enhance the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to inhibit host immunity. Further, we find that the unusual virulence of this virus is potentially the consequence of Darwinian selection‐driven epistasis in protein evolution. Our findings warrant further characterization of macrodomain-specific evolutionary substitutions in in vitro and in vivo models to determine their inhibitory effects on the host immune system.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-020-00120-6"

The CD28 costimulation is an essential regulator of CD4 T-cell responses, however, its relative importance in naive and memory T cells is not fully understood. Using different model systems, we observe that human memory T cells are more sensitive to CD28 costimulation than naive T cells. To deconvolute how the T-cell receptor (TCR) and CD28 orchestrate activation of human T cells, we stimulate cells using varying intensities of TCR and CD28 and profiled gene expression. We show that genes involved in cell cycle progression and division are CD28-driven in memory cells, but under TCR control in naive cells. We further demonstrate that T-helper differentiation and cytokine expression are controlled by CD28. Using chromatin accessibility profiling, we observe that AP1 transcriptional regulation is enriched when both TCR and CD28 are engaged, whereas open chromatin near CD28-sensitive genes is enriched for NF-kB motifs. Lastly, we show that CD28-sensitive genes are enriched in GWAS regions associated with immune diseases, implicating a role for CD28 in disease development. Our study provides important insights into the differential role of costimulation in naive and memory T-cell responses and disease susceptibility.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-020-00118-0"

In addition, we discovered pathogen-specific regulation of spp-9 that was not clearly demarcated by Gram nature of the bacterial challenge. Multiple molecular innate immune response pathways, including DBL-1/TGF-β-like, insulin-like, and p38/MAPK, regulate expression of spp-9.

Despite their broad occurrence, little is known about their formation and biological significance. Carbohydrate-specific antibodies are often classified as natural antibodies under the assumption that they arise without prior exposure to exogenous antigens. On the other hand, various carbohydrate-specific antibodies, including antibodies to ABO blood group antigens, emerge after the contact of immune cells with the intestinal microbiota, which expresses a vast diversity of carbohydrate antigens. Here we explore the development of carbohydrate-specific antibodies in humans, addressing the definition of natural antibodies and the production of carbohydrate-specific antibodies upon antigen stimulation. We focus on the significance of the intestinal microbiota in shaping carbohydrate-specific antibodies not just in the gut, but also in the blood circulation. The structural similarity between bacterial carbohydrate antigens and surface glycoconjugates of protists, fungi and animals leads to the production of carbohydrate-specific antibodies protective against a broad range of pathogens. Mimicry between bacterial and human glycoconjugates, however, can also lead to the generation of carbohydrate-specific antibodies that cross-react with human antigens, thereby contributing to the development of autoimmune disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-020-0105-9"

We assessed whether 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in seven genes (TLR2, TLR4, TIRAP, IRAK4, TRAF6, NOD2, and CISH) that mediate host immune response were associated with S. aureus bacteremia duration. Subjects included 158 patients with short-term (≤4 days) and 44 with persistent (>4 days) S. aureus bacteremia from an academic medical center. In single SNP analyses, the minor allele frequencies of three TIRAP SNPs (rs655540, rs563011, and rs8177376) were higher in persistent bacteremia (P < 0.05). A haplotype with all three minor alleles was also associated with persistent bacteremia (P = 0.037).

All seven SNPs are located in binding sites for proteins or noncoding RNAs that regulate transcription. None of the associations remained statistically significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons.

"gene","Natural genetic variation in Stim1 creates stroke in the spontaneously hypertensive rat","Similar to humans, the risk of cerebrovascular disease in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-A3/SHRSP) arises from naturally occurring genetic variation. In the present study, we show the involvement of genetic variation affecting the store-operated calcium signaling gene, Stim1, in the pathogenesis of stroke in SHR. Stim1 is a key lymphocyte activation signaling molecule and contains functional variation in SHR-A3 that diverges from stroke-resistant SHR-B2. We created a SHR-A3 congenic line in which Stim1 was substituted with the corresponding genomic segment from SHR-B2. Compared with SHR-A3 rats, Stim1 congenic SHR-A3 (SHR-A3(Stim1-B2)) have reduced cerebrovascular disease in response to salt loading including lower neurological deficit scores and cerebral edema. Microbleeds and major hemorrhages occurred in over half of SHR-A3 rats. These lesions were absent in SHR-A3(Stim1-B2) rats. Loss of Stim1 function in mice and humans is associated with antibody-mediated autoimmunity due to defects in T lymphocyte helper function to B cells. We investigated autoantibody formation using a high-density protein array to detect the presence of IgG and IgM autoantibodies in SHR-A3. Autoantibodies to key cerebrovascular stress proteins were detected that were reduced in the congenic line.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-020-0097-5"
"gene","Evolution and function of interleukin-4 receptor signaling in adaptive immunity and neutrophils","The cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13, signaling via the IL-4 receptor (IL-4R), orchestrate type 2 immunity to helminth infections and toxins. Activation of epithelial and myeloid cells, and a transient neutrophils influx initiates type 2 immune responses, which are dominated by basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, B cell immunoglobulin E production, and type 2 T helper and T follicular helper cells. Interestingly, IL-4 and IL-13 can curtail chemotaxis and several effector functions of neutrophils in mice and humans. This inhibitory role of IL-4 and IL-13 probably developed to limit tissue damage by neutrophils during type 2 immunity where a “weep and sweep” response aims at expulsion and decreased fecundity, instead of killing, of macroparasites. Here, we review when IL-4R signaling cytokines appeared during evolution relative to neutrophils and adaptive immunity. Neutrophil-like granular phagocytes were present in invertebrates throughout the bilaterian clade, but we were unable to find data on IL-4, IL-13, or their receptors in invertebrates. Conversely, vertebrates had both adaptive immunity and IL-4, IL-13, and IL-4Rs, suggesting that type 2 cytokines evolved together with adaptive immunity. Further studies are necessary to determine whether IL-4R signaling in neutrophils was established simultaneously with the appearance of adaptive immunity or later.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-020-0095-7"

Results from the IMPROVE study","The genes regulating circulating levels of soluble gp130 (sgp130), the antagonist of the inflammatory response in atherosclerosis driven by interleukin 6, are largely unknown. Aims of the present study were to identify genetic loci associated with circulating sgp130 and to explore the potential association between variants associated with sgp130 and markers of subclinical atherosclerosis. The study is based on IMPROVE (n = 3703), a cardiovascular multicentre study designed to investigate the determinants of carotid intima media thickness, a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis. Genomic DNA was genotyped by the CardioMetaboChip and ImmunoChip. About 360,842 SNPs were tested for association with log-transformed sgp130, using linear regression adjusted for age, gender, and population stratification using PLINK v1.07. A p value of 1 × 10−5 was chosen as threshold for significance value. In an exploratory analysis, SNPs associated with sgp130 were tested for association with c-IMT measures. We identified two SNPs significantly associated with sgp130 levels and 24 showing suggestive association with sgp130 levels. One SNP (rs17688225) on chromosome 14 was positively associated with sgp130 serum levels (β = 0.03 SE = 0.007, p = 4.77 × 10−5) and inversely associated with c-IMT (c-IMTmean–max β = −0.001 SE = 0.005, p = 0.0342).

"gene","Transcribed B lymphocyte genes and multiple sclerosis risk genes are underrepresented in Epstein–Barr Virus hypomethylated regions","Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) infection appears to be necessary for the development of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), although the specific mechanisms are unknown. More than 200 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are known to be associated with the risk of developing MS. About a quarter of these are also highly associated with proximal gene expression in B cells infected with EBV (lymphoblastoid cell lines—LCLs). The DNA of LCLs is hypomethylated compared with both uninfected and activated B cells. Since methylation can affect gene expression, and so cell differentiation and immune evasion, we hypothesised that EBV-driven hypomethylation may affect the interaction between EBV infection and MS. We interrogated an existing dataset comprising three individuals with whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data from EBV transformed B cells and CD40L-activated B cells. DNA methylation surrounding MS risk SNPs associated with gene expression in LCLs (LCLeQTL) was less likely to be hypomethylated than randomly selected chromosomal regions. Differential methylation was independent of genomic features such as promoter regions, but genes preferentially expressed in EBV-infected B cells, including the LCLeQTL genes, were underrepresented in the hypomethylated regions.

Given the ubiquity of mild GAS infections, it remains unclear why healthy individuals will occasionally develop life-threatening infections, raising the possibility of host genetic predisposition. Here, we present the results of a case–control study including 43 invasive GAS cases and 1540 controls. Using HLA imputation and linear mixed models, we find each copy of the HLA-DQA1*01:03 allele associates with a twofold increased risk of disease (odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.3–4.4, P = 0.009), an association which persists with classical HLA typing of a subset of cases and analysis with an alternative large control dataset with validated HLA data. Moreover, we propose the association is driven by the allele itself rather than the background haplotype. Overall this finding provides impetus for further investigation of the immunogenetic basis of this devastating bacterial disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-019-0082-z"
"gene","CARving up colorectal cancer organoids in vitro","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide [1]. Over the last decades, the introduction of screening tests, changes in lifestyle and risk factors, and advances in surgery and diagnostics have reduced CRC incidence and mortality. In addition, clinical outcomes of patients with metastatic disease (mCRC) have improved substantially, with median overall survival exceeding 30 months in the era of combination systemic chemotherapy, targeted therapies, and resection or ablation of localized metastases [2,3,4]. This is reflected by an increasing number of mCRC patients treated within the framework of clinical trials or specialized cancer centers, and is paralleled by the development of novel imaging modalities and molecular tests to monitor these patients. Nevertheless, unfortunately, the majority of mCRC patients are still not definitely cured and will ultimately succumb to their disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-019-0079-7"
"gene","Yersinia pestis and plague: an updated view on evolution, virulence determinants, immune subversion, vaccination, and diagnostics","Plague is a vector-borne disease caused by Yersinia pestis. Transmitted by fleas from rodent reservoirs, Y. pestis emerged <6000 years ago from an enteric bacterial ancestor through events of gene gain and genome reduction. It is a highly remarkable model for the understanding of pathogenic bacteria evolution, and a major concern for public health as highlighted by recent human outbreaks. A complex set of virulence determinants, including the Yersinia outer-membrane proteins (Yops), the broad-range protease Pla, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and iron capture systems play critical roles in the molecular strategies that Y. pestis employs to subvert the human immune system, allowing unrestricted bacterial replication in lymph nodes (bubonic plague) and in lungs (pneumonic plague). Some of these immunogenic proteins as well as the capsular antigen F1 are exploited for diagnostic purposes, which are critical in the context of the rapid onset of death in the absence of antibiotic treatment (less than a week for bubonic plague and <48 h for pneumonic plague). Here, we review recent research advances on Y. pestis evolution, virulence factor function, bacterial strategies to subvert mammalian innate immune responses, vaccination, and problems associated with pneumonic plague diagnosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-019-0065-0"
"gene","Mother−child histocompatibility and risk of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus among mothers","The study objective was to test the hypothesis that having histocompatible children increases the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), possibly by contributing to the persistence of fetal cells acquired during pregnancy. We conducted a case control study using data from the UC San Francisco Mother Child Immunogenetic Study and studies at the Inova Translational Medicine Institute. We imputed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and minor histocompatibility antigens (mHags). We created a variable of exposure to histocompatible children. We estimated an average sequence similarity matching (SSM) score for each mother based on discordant mother−child alleles as a measure of histocompatibility. We used logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals. A total of 138 RA, 117 SLE, and 913 control mothers were analyzed. Increased risk of RA was associated with having any child compatible at HLA-B (OR 1.9; 1.2–3.1), DPB1 (OR 1.8; 1.2–2.6) or DQB1 (OR 1.8; 1.2–2.7). Compatibility at mHag ZAPHIR was associated with reduced risk of SLE among mothers carrying the HLA-restriction allele B*07:02 (n = 262; OR 0.4; 0.2–0.8). Our findings support the hypothesis that mother−child histocompatibility is associated with risk of RA and SLE.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-018-0055-7"
"gene","The FCGR2C allele that modulated the risk of HIV-1 infection in the Thai RV144 vaccine trial is implicated in HIV-1 disease progression","In the HIV-1 Thai RV144 vaccine trial—the only trial to demonstrate any vaccine efficacy to date—a three-variant haplotype within the Fc gamma receptor 2C gene (FCGR2C) modified the risk of HIV-1 acquisition. A similar vaccine regimen is currently being evaluated in South Africa in the HVTN702 trial, where the predominant population is polymorphic for only a single variant in the haplotype, c.134-96C>T. To investigate the significance of c.134-96C>T in HIV-specific immunity in South Africans, this study assessed its role in HIV-1 disease progression. In a cohort of HIV-1-infected South African controllers (n = 71) and progressors (n = 73), the c.134-96C>T minor allele significantly associated with increased odds of HIV-1 disease progression (odds ratio 3.80, 95% confidence interval 1.90–7.62; P = 2.0 × 10–4, PBonf = 2.4 × 10–3). It is unlikely that the underlying mechanism involves wild-type FcγRIIc function, since only a single study participant was predicted to express wild-type FcγRIIc as determined by the FCGR2C c.798+1A>G splice-site variant. Conversely, in silico analysis revealed a potential role for c.134-96C> T in modulating mRNA transcription. In conclusion, these data provide additional evidence towards a role for FCGR2C c.134-96C>T in the context of HIV-1 and underscore the need to investigate its significance in the HVTN702 efficacy trial in South Africa.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-018-0053-9"
"gene","MICA and NKG2D variants as risk factors in spondyloarthritis: a case–control study","The major histocompatibility complex class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) glycoprotein mediates the activation of the natural killer group 2D receptor (NKG2D) expressed on NK and CD8+ T cells. A methionine or valine at position 129 in exon 3 results in strong (MICA129 met) or weak (MICA129 val) binding to NKG2D. The MICA A5.1 allele causes a premature stop codon. Various NKG2D polymorphisms are associated with low (NKC3 C/C and NKC4 C/C) or high (NKC3 G/G and NKC4 T/T) levels of NK cell cytotoxic activity. In 162 patients with spondyloarthritis (115 with ankylosing spondyloarthritis, 46 with psoriatic arthritis and 1 with reactive arthritis) compared to 124 healthy controls, MICA-129 with methionine allele was more frequent in patients with spondyloarthritis (odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) = 4.84 (2.75‒8.67)), whereas MICA-129 val/val, MICA A5.1 and NKC3 C/C variants were less frequent (OR = 0.20 (0.11‒0.37), 0.15 (0.06‒0.36) and 0.24 (0.13‒0.44), respectively). After adjustment for HLA-B*27 status, only NKC3 C/C remained linked to spondyloarthritis (adjusted OR = 0.14 (0.06‒0.33)). Homozygosity for MICA A5.1 is linked to ankylosing spondyloarthritis, and NKC3 C/C and MICA-129 val/val to psoriatic arthritis. MICA and NKC3 polymorphisms (related to a low NK cell cytotoxic activity) constituted a genetic association with spondyloarthritis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-018-0044-x"
"gene","Elevated T cell levels in peripheral blood predict poor clinical response following rituximab treatment in new-onset type 1 diabetes","Biologic treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) with agents including anti-CD3 (otelixizumab and teplizumab), anti-CD20 (rituximab), LFA3Ig (alafacept), and CTLA4Ig (abatacept) results in transient stabilization of insulin C-peptide, a surrogate for endogenous insulin secretion. With the goal of inducing more robust immune tolerance, we used systems biology approaches to elucidate mechanisms associated with C-peptide stabilization in clinical trial blood samples from new-onset T1D subjects treated with the B cell-depleting drug, rituximab. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of whole-blood samples from this trial revealed a transient increase in heterogeneous T cell populations, which were associated with decreased pharmacodynamic activity of rituximab, increased proliferative responses to islet antigens, and more rapid C-peptide loss. Our findings illustrate complexity in hematopoietic remodeling that accompanies B cell depletion by rituximab, which impacts and predicts therapeutic efficacy in T1D. Our data also suggest that a combination of rituximab with therapy targeting CD4 + T cells may be beneficial for T1D subjects.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-018-0032-1"
"gene","Genetic variants at the 16p13 locus confer risk for eosinophilic esophagitis","Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the esophagus triggered by immune hypersensitivity to food. Herein, we tested whether genetic risk factors for known, non-allergic, immune-mediated diseases, particularly those involving autoimmunity, were associated with EoE risk. We used the high-density Immunochip platform, encoding 200,000 genetic variants for major auto-immune disease. Accordingly, 1214 subjects with EoE of European ancestry and 3734 population controls were genotyped and assessed using data directly generated or imputed from the previously published GWAS. We found lack of association of EoE with the genetic variants in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, II, and III genes and nearly all other loci using a highly powered study design with dense genotyping throughout the locus. Importantly, we identified an EoE risk locus at 16p13 with genome-wide significance (Pcombined=2.05 × 10−9, odds ratio = 0.76−0.81). This region is known to encode for the genes CLEC16A, DEXI, and CIITI, which are expressed in immune cells and esophageal epithelial cells. Suggestive EoE risk were also seen 5q23 (intergenic) and 7p15 (JAZF1). Overall, we have identified an additional EoE risk locus at 16p13 and highlight a shared and unique genetic etiology of EoE with a spectrum of immune-associated diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-018-0034-z"
"gene","TMEM173 variants and potential importance to human biology and disease","TMEM173 gene encodes the protein STING (stimulator of interferon genes), a key player in host defense against pathogens. Mutations in the human TMEM173 gene cause a life-threatening auto-inflammatory disease called SAVI (STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy). Human STING is also a promising therapeutic target for cancers and infectious diseases. Recently, Aduro Biotech and Novartis announced a $250M-plus initiative to develop STING-targeting cancer immunotherapies. Thus, understanding the genetics of the human TMEM173 gene is important for both basic and translational research. The human TMEM173 gene has great heterogeneity and population stratification. R232 of STING is the most common human TMEM173 allele. However, >50% of Americans are not R232/R232. HAQ (R71H-G230A-R293Q) is the second most common human TMEM173 allele. While R232/R232 is the dominant TMEM173 genotype in Europeans, R232/HAQ is the most common TMEM173 genotype in East Asians. Importantly, recent studies suggested that HAQ and H232 are likely loss-of-function TMEM173 alleles. In all, ~30% of East Asians and ~10% of Europeans are HAQ/HAQ, HAQ/H232, or H232/H232.

"gene","Genetic variants and pathways implicated in a pediatric inflammatory bowel disease cohort","In the United States, approximately 5% of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are younger than 20 years old. Studies of pediatric cohorts can provide unique insights into genetic architecture of IBD, which includes Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Large genome-wide association studies have found more than 200 IBD-associated loci but explain a minority of disease variance for CD and UC. We sought to characterize the contribution of rare variants to disease development, comparing exome sequencing of 368 pediatric IBD patients to publicly available exome sequencing (dbGaP) and aggregate frequency data (ExAC). Using dbGaP data, we performed logistic regression for common variants and optimal unified association tests (SKAT-O) for rare, likely-deleterious variants. We further compared rare variants to ExAC counts with Fisher’s exact tests. We did pathway enrichment analysis on the most significant genes from each comparison. Many variants overlapped with known IBD-associated genes (e.g. NOD2). Rare variants were enriched in CD-associated loci (p = 0.009) and showed suggestive enrichment in neutrophil function genes (p = 0.05). Pathway enrichment implicated immune-related pathways, especially cell killing and apoptosis. Variants in extracellular matrix genes also emerged as an important theme in our analysis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-018-0015-2"

Here, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 784 patients undergoing placebo treatment in Phase III Asthma or Rheumatoid Arthritis trials to assess the impact of previously reported variation on patient outcomes in the placebo arms and to identify novel variants associated with the placebo response. Contrary to expectations based on previous reports, we did not observe any statistically significant associations between genomic variants and placebo treatment outcome.

"gene","Choriodecidual leukocytes display a unique gene expression signature in spontaneous labor at term","Prior to and during the process of human labor, maternal circulating leukocytes infiltrate the maternal-fetal interface (choriodecidua) and become activated resembling choriodecidual leukocytes. Since, there is no evidence comparing maternal circulating and choriodecidual leukocytes, herein, we characterized their transcriptome and explored the biological processes enriched in choriodecidual leukocytes. From women undergoing spontaneous term labor we isolated circulating and choriodecidual leukocytes, performed microarray analysis (n = 5) and qRT-PCR validation (n = 9) and interaction network analysis with up-regulated genes. We found 270 genes up-regulated and only 17 genes down-regulated in choriodecidual leukocytes compared to maternal circulating leukocytes. The most up-regulated genes were CCL18, GPNMB, SEPP1, FN1, RNASE1, SPP1, C1QC, and PLTP. The biological processes enriched in choriodecidual leukocytes were cell migration and regulation of immune response, chemotaxis, and humoral immune responses. Our results show striking differences between the transcriptome of choriodecidual and maternal circulating leukocytes. Choriodecidual leukocytes are enriched in immune mediators implicated in the spontaneous process of labor at term.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41435-017-0010-z"
"gene","Revealing complete complex KIR haplotypes phased by long-read sequencing technology","The killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) region of human chromosome 19 contains up to 16 genes for natural killer (NK) cell receptors that recognize human leukocyte antigen (HLA)/peptide complexes and other ligands. The KIR proteins fulfill functional roles in infections, pregnancy, autoimmune diseases and transplantation. However, their characterization remains a constant challenge. Not only are the genes highly homologous due to their recent evolution by tandem duplications, but the region is structurally dynamic due to frequent transposon-mediated recombination. A sequencing approach that precisely captures the complexity of KIR haplotypes for functional annotation is desirable. We present a unique approach to haplotype the KIR loci using single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing. Using this method, we have—for the first time—comprehensively sequenced and phased sixteen KIR haplotypes from eight individuals without imputation. The information revealed four novel haplotype structures, a novel gene-fusion allele, novel and confirmed insertion/deletion events, a homozygous individual, and overall diversity for the structural haplotypes and their alleles. These KIR haplotypes augment our existing knowledge by providing high-quality references, evolutionary informers, and source material for imputation.

"gene","Investigation of a possible extended risk haplotype in the IL23R region associated with ankylosing spondylitis","The IL23R region on chromosome 1 exhibits complex associations with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We used publicly available epigenomic information and historical genetic association data to identify a putative regulatory element (PRE) in the intergenic region between IL23R and IL12RB2, which includes two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) independently associated with AS—rs924080 (P=2 × 10−3) and rs11578380 (P=2 × 10−4). In luciferase reporter assays, this PRE showed silencer activity (P<0.001). Haplotype and conditional analysis of 4230 historical AS cases and 9700 controls revealed a possible AS-associated extended haplotype, including the PRE and risk variants at three SNPs (rs11209026, rs11209032 and rs924080), but excluding the rs11578380 risk variant. However, the rs924080 association was absent after conditioning on the primary association with rs11209032, which, in contrast, was robust to conditioning on all other AS-associated SNPs in this region (P<2 × 10−8). The role of this putative silencer on some IL23R extended haplotypes therefore remains unclear.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene20175"
"gene","Evaluating genetic susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in African Americans using admixture mapping","The incidence of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is significantly higher in African American (AA) than in European-descended populations. We used admixture mapping (AM) to test the hypothesis that genomic variations with different frequencies in European and African ancestral genomes influence susceptibility to SAB in AAs. A total of 565 adult AAs (390 cases with SAB; 175 age-matched controls) were genotyped for AM analysis. A case-only admixture score and a mixed χ2(1df) score (MIX) to jointly evaluate both single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and admixture association (P<5.00e-08) were computed using MIXSCORE. In addition, a permutation scheme was implemented to derive multiplicity adjusted P-values (genome-wide 0.05 significance threshold: P<9.46e-05). After empirical multiplicity adjustment, one region on chromosome 6 (52 SNPs, P=4.56e-05) in the HLA class II region was found to exhibit a genome-wide statistically significant increase in European ancestry. This region encodes genes involved in HLA-mediated immune response and these results provide additional evidence for genetic variation influencing HLA-mediated immunity, modulating susceptibility to SAB.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene20176"

We associated the CTI/TTD haplotype (Hap-1) and TCI/CCI haplotype (Hap-2) in the IL4 gene formed by the −590, +33 and variable number of tandem repeat polymorphisms with the severity of chronic periodontitis in humans. The functionality of these IL4 haplotypes in the response of immune cells to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) with Ionomycin and IL-1β (as inflammatory stimuli) was evaluated. Gene expression (quantitative real-time PCR), profile of secreted cytokines (multiplex) and phenotypic polarization of T cells (flow cytometry) were the outcomes assessed. Green fluorescent protein reporter plasmid constructs containing specific IL4 haplotype were transiently transfected into JM cells to assess the influence of the individual haplotypes on promoter activity. In response to inflammatory stimuli the immune cells from Hap-1 haplotype had increased expression of anti-inflammatory IL4; conversely, the Hap-2 haplotype showed higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The haplotype CTI proved to be the most important for the regulation of IL4 promoter, regardless of the nature of the inflammatory stimulation; whereas the polymorphism in the promoter region had the least functional effect. In conclusion, IL4 haplotypes studied are functional and trigger opposite immune responses: anti-inflammatory (Hap-1) and pro-inflammatory (Hap-2). In addition, we identified the CTI haplotype as the main responsible for the regulation of IL4 transcriptional activity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201647"
"gene","MARCO variants are associated with phagocytosis, pulmonary tuberculosis susceptibility and Beijing lineage","Macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) has an important role in the phagocytosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). We hypothesized that MARCO polymorphisms are associated with phagocytosis, tuberculosis (TB) disease susceptibility and presentation, and infecting lineage. We used a human cellular model to examine how MARCO genotype mediates the immune response; a case–control study to investigate tuberculosis host genetic susceptibility; and a host–pathogen genetic analysis to study host–pathogen interactions. Two MARCO heterozygous (AG) genotypes (single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs2278589 and rs6751745) were associated with impaired phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate-cord factor and β-glucan-coated beads in macrophages. The heterozygous genotypes of rs2278589 and rs6751745 were also associated with increased risk of pulmonary TB (PTB; rs2278589, P=0.001, odds ratio (OR)=1.6; rs6751745, P=0.009, OR=1.4), and with severe chest X-ray abnormalities (P=0.007, OR=1.6). These two genotypes were also associated with the Beijing lineage (rs2278589, P=0.001, OR=1.7; rs6751745, P=0.01, OR=1.5). Together, these results suggest that MARCO polymorphisms may regulate phagocytosis of M. tuberculosis and susceptibility and severity of PTB.

"gene","Maternal and child cytokine relationship in early life is not altered by cytokine gene polymorphisms","The development of immune responses is influenced by the interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Our previous study showed a close association between maternal and young infant’s cytokine responses. The question is how this association evolves over time and the contribution of genetic polymorphisms to this association. Five cytokines in mitogen-stimulated whole blood culture were measured from pregnant mothers and their children aged 2, 5, 12, 24 and 48 months. Cytokine gene polymorphisms were determined in both mothers and children. High production of maternal interleukin (IL)-10, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) was significantly associated with higher levels of the corresponding cytokines in their children at 2 months (T2), but the association decreased over time. Maternal single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IFN-γ gene, rs3181032, was found to be associated with child’s IFN-γ levels at T2 only, whereas maternal IL-10 rs4579758 and child’s TNF-α rs13215091 were associated with child’s corresponding cytokines at later ages but not at T2. In the final models including the gene polymorphisms, maternal cytokines were still the strongest determinant of child cytokines. Maternal cytokine during pregnancy, which could be a proxy for child’s environmental factors, showed its highest impact at early age, with no or little influence from genetic factors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201635"
"gene","IFNL3/4 genotype is associated with altered immune cell populations in peripheral blood in chronic hepatitis C infection","Single-nucleotide polymorphisms near the interferon lambda 3 (IFNL3) gene predict outcomes to infection and anti-viral treatment in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. To identify IFNL3 genotype effects on peripheral blood, we collected phenotype data on 400 patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C (CHC). The IFNL3 responder genotype predicted significantly lower white blood cells (WBCs), as well as lower absolute numbers of monocytes, neutrophils and lymphocytes for both rs8099917 and rs12979860. We sought to define the WBC subsets driving this association using flow cytometry of 67 untreated CHC individuals. Genotype-associated differences were seen in the ratio of CD4CD45RO+ to CD4CD45RO−; CD8CD45RO+ to CD8CD45RO−, NK CD56 dim to bright and monocyte numbers and percentages. Whole blood expression levels of IFNL3, IFNLR1 (interferon lambda receptor 1), IFNLR1-mem (a membrane-associated receptor), IFNLR1-sol (a truncated soluble receptor), MxA and T- and NK (natural killer) cell transcription factors TBX21, GATA3, RORC, FOXP3 and EOMES in two subjects were also determined. CHC patients demonstrated endogenous IFN activation with higher levels of MxA, IFNLR1, IFNLR1-mem and IFNLR1-sol, and IFNL3 genotype-associated differences in transcription factors. Taken together, these data provide evidence of an IFNL3 genotype association with differences in monocyte, T- and NK cell levels in the peripheral blood of patients with CHC. This could underpin genotype associations with spontaneous and treatment-induced HCV clearance and hepatic necroinflammation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201627"

Regions of association were defined based on the significance of linkage disequilibrium blocks. Candidate genes were cross-referenced based on a review of current literature, with attention to molecular function and directly interacting proteins. Supplementary annotations and pathway enrichment scores were generated using The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. The candidate set of 220 MS susceptibility genes prioritized by GWAS-NR was highly enriched with genes involved in biological pathways related to positive regulation of cell, lymphocyte and leukocyte activation (P=6.1E-15, 1.2E-14 and 5.0E-14, respectively). Novel gene candidates include key regulators of NF-κB signaling and CD4+ T helper type 1 (Th1) and T helper type 17 (Th17) lineages. A large subset of MS candidate genes prioritized by GWAS-NR were found to interact in a tractable pathway regulating the NF-κB-mediated induction and infiltration of pro-inflammatory Th1/Th17 T-cell lineages, and maintenance of immune tolerance by T-regulatory cells. This mechanism provides a biological context that potentially links clinical observations in MS to the underlying genetic landscape that may confer susceptibility.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201623"

LAT expression is transiently upregulated upon T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement, but molecular mechanisms conveying TCR signaling to enhanced LAT transcription are not fully understood. Here we found that a Jurkat subline J.CaM2, initially characterized as LAT deficient, conditionally re-expressed LAT upon the treatment with a protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). We took advantage of the above observation for studying cis-elements and trans-acting factors contributing to the activation-induced expression of LAT. We identified a LAT gene region spanning nucleotide position −14 to +357 relative to the ATG start codon as containing novel cis-regulatory elements that were able to promote PMA-induced reporter transcription in the absence of the core LAT promoter. Interestingly, a point mutation in LAT intron 1, identified in J.CaM2 cells, downmodulated LAT promoter activity by 50%. Mithramycin A, a selective Sp1 DNA-binding inhibitor, abolished LAT expression upon PMA treatment as did calcium ionophore ionomycin (Iono) and valproic acid (VPA), widely used as an anti-epileptic drug. Our data introduce J.CaM2 cells as a model for dissecting drivers and blockers of activation induced expression of LAT.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201625"

"gene","Cistromic and genetic evidence that the vitamin D receptor mediates susceptibility to latitude-dependent autoimmune diseases","The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates gene expression in many cell types, including immune cells. It requires binding of 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 (1,25D3) for activation. Many autoimmune diseases show latitude-dependent prevalence and/or association with vitamin D deficiency, and vitamin D supplementation is commonly used in their clinical management. 1,25D3 is regulated by genes associated with the risk of autoimmune diseases and predominantly expressed in myeloid cells. We determined the VDR cistrome in monocytes and monocyte-derived inflammatory (DC1) and tolerogenic dendritic cells (DC2). VDR motifs were highly overrepresented in ChIP-Seq peaks in stimulated monocyte (40%), DC1 (21%) and DC2 (47%), P<E−100 for all. Of the nearly 11 000 VDR-binding peaks identified across the genome in DC1s, 1317 were shared with DC2s (91% of DC2 sites) and 1579 with monocytes (83% of monocyte sites). Latitude-dependent autoimmune disease risk polymorphisms were highly overrepresented within 5 kb of the peaks. Several transcription factor recognition motifs were highly overrepresented in the peaks, including those for the autoimmune risk gene, BATF. This evidence indicates that VDR regulates hundreds of myeloid cell genes and that the molecular pathways controlled by VDR in these cells are important in maintaining tolerance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201612"

We studied 3535 child residents of a malaria-endemic region of coastal Kenya and report, for the first time, that the CR1 Knops blood group alleles Sl2 and McCb, and homozygous HbSS are positively associated with RBC CR1 level. Sickle cell trait and ABO blood group did not influence RBC CR1 level. We also confirm the previous observation that α+thalassaemia is associated with reduced RBC CR1 level, possibly due to small RBC volume, and that age-related changes in RBC CR1 expression occur throughout childhood. RBC CR1 level in malaria-endemic African populations is a complex phenotype influenced by multiple factors that should be taken into account in the design and interpretation of future studies on CR1 and malaria susceptibility.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene20162"
"gene","The multiple sclerosis susceptibility genes TAGAP and IL2RA are regulated by vitamin D in CD4+ T cells","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system that develops in genetically susceptible individuals. The majority of the MS-associated gene variants are located in genetic regions with importance for T-cell differentiation. Vitamin D is a potent immunomodulator, and vitamin D deficiency has been suggested to be associated with increased MS disease susceptibility and activity. In CD4+ T cells, we have analyzed in vitro vitamin D responsiveness of genes that contain an MS-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and with one or more vitamin D response elements in their regulatory regions. We identify IL2RA and TAGAP as novel vitamin D target genes. The vitamin D response is observed in samples from both MS patients and controls, and is not dependent on the genotype of MS-associated SNPs in the respective genes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201561"
"gene","KIR haplotypes are associated with late-onset type 1 diabetes in European–American families","Classical human leukocyte antigens (HLA) genes confer the strongest, but not the only, genetic susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), on natural killer (NK) cells, bind ligands including class I HLA. We examined presence or absence, with copy number, of KIR loci in 1698 individuals, from 339 multiplex type 1 diabetes families, from the Human Biological Data Interchange, previously genotyped for HLA. Combining family data with KIR copy number information allowed assignment of haplotypes using identity by descent. This is the first disease study to use KIR copy number typing and unambiguously define haplotypes by gene transmission. KIR A1 haplotypes were positively associated with T1D in the subset of patients without the high T1D risk HLA genotype, DR3/DR4 (odds ratio=1.29, P=0.0096). The data point to a role for KIR in type 1 diabetes risk in late-onset patients. In the top quartile (age of onset>14), KIR A2 haplotype was overtransmitted (63.4%, odds ratio=1.73, P=0.024) and KIR B haplotypes were undertransmitted (41.1%, odds ratio=0.70, P=0.0052) to patients. The data suggest that inhibitory ‘A’ haplotypes are predisposing and stimulatory ‘B’ haplotypes confer protection in both DR3/DR4-negative and late-onset patient groups.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201544"
"gene","A functional AT/G polymorphism in the 5′-untranslated region of SETDB2 in the IgE locus on human chromosome 13q14","The immunoglobulin E (IgE)-associated locus on human chromosome 13q14 influencing asthma-related traits contains the genes PHF11 and SETDB2. SETDB2 is located in the same linkage disequilibrium region as PHF11 and polymorphisms within SETDB2 have been shown to associate with total serum IgE levels. In this report, we sequenced the 15 exons of SETDB2 and identified a single previously ungenotyped mutation (AT/G, rs386770867) in the 5′-untranslated region of the gene. The polymorphism was found to be significantly associated with serum IgE levels in our asthma cohort (P=0.0012). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the transcription factor Ying Yang 1 binds to the AT allele, whereas SRY (Sex determining Region Y) binds to the G allele. Allele-specific transcription analysis (allelotyping) was performed in 35 individuals heterozygous for rs386770867 from a panel of 200 British families ascertained through probands with severe stage 3 asthma. The AT allele was found to be significantly overexpressed in these individuals (P=1.26 × 10−21). A dual-luciferase assay with the pGL3 luciferase reporter gene showed that the AT allele significantly affects transcriptional activities. Our results indicate that the IgE-associated AT/G polymorphism (rs386770867) regulates transcription of SETDB2.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201536"
"gene","CTLA-4 as a genetic determinant in autoimmune Addison’s disease","In common with several other autoimmune diseases, autoimmune Addison’s disease (AAD) is thought to be caused by a combination of deleterious susceptibility polymorphisms in several genes, together with undefined environmental factors and stochastic events. To date, the strongest genomic association with AAD has been with alleles at the HLA locus, DR3–DQ2 and DR4. The contribution of other genetic variants has been inconsistent. We have studied the association of 16 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CD28–CTLA-4–ICOS genomic locus, in a cohort comprising 691 AAD patients of Norwegian and UK origin with matched controls. We have also performed a meta-analysis including 1002 patients from European countries. The G-allele of SNP rs231775 in CTLA-4 is associated with AAD in Norwegian patients (odds ratio (OR)=1.35 (confidence interval (CI) 1.10–1.66), P=0.004), but not in UK patients. The same allele is associated with AAD in the total European population (OR=1.37 (CI 1.13–1.66), P=0.002). A three-marker haplotype, comprising PROMOTER_1661, rs231726 and rs1896286 was found to be associated with AAD in the Norwegian cohort only (OR 2.43 (CI 1.68–3.51), P=0.00013). This study points to the CTLA-4 gene as a susceptibility locus for the development of AAD, and refines its mapping within the wider genomic locus.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201527"
"gene","Genetic variation in the HLA region is associated with susceptibility to herpes zoster","Herpes zoster, commonly referred to as shingles, is caused by the varicella zoster virus (VZV). VZV initially manifests as chicken pox, most commonly in childhood, can remain asymptomatically latent in nerve tissues for many years and often re-emerges as shingles. Although reactivation may be related to immune suppression, aging and female sex, most inter-individual variability in re-emergence risk has not been explained to date. We performed a genome-wide association analyses in 22 981 participants (2280 shingles cases) from the electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network. Using Cox survival and logistic regression, we identified a genomic region in the combined and European ancestry groups that has an age of onset effect reaching genome-wide significance (P>1.0 × 10−8). This region tags the non-coding gene HCP5 (HLA Complex P5) in the major histocompatibility complex. This gene is an endogenous retrovirus and likely influences viral activity through regulatory functions. Variants in this genetic region are known to be associated with delay in development of AIDS in people infected by HIV. Our study provides further suggestion that this region may have a critical role in viral suppression and could potentially harbor a clinically actionable variant for the shingles vaccine.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201451"
"gene","SNP screening of central MHC-identified HLA-DMB as a candidate susceptibility gene for HIV-related Kaposi’s sarcoma","The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6p21.3 is suspected to host susceptibility loci for HIV-related Kaposi’s sarcoma (HIV-KS). A nested case–control study in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study was designed to conduct fine genetic association mapping across central MHC. Individuals co-infected with HIV-1 and human herpes virus-8 who later developed KS were defined as cases (n=354) and were matched 1:1 with co-infected KS-free controls. We report data for new independent MHC class II and III susceptibility loci. In particular, class II HLA-DMB emerged as a strong candidate, with the intronic variant rs6902982 A>G associated with a fourfold increase of risk (odds ratio (OR)=4.09; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.90–8.80; P=0.0003). A striking multiplicative effect on the estimated risk was associated with further carriage of two non-synonymous variants, rs1800453 A>G (Asp697Gly) and rs4148880 A>G (Ile393Val), in the linked TAP1 gene (OR=10.5; 95% CI=2.54–43.6; P=0.0012). The class III susceptibility variant is moderately associated with HIV-KS and lies within a 120-kb-long haplotype (OR=1.52; 95% CI=1.01–2.28; P=0.047) formed by rs7029 A>G (GPANK1 3′ untranslated region), rs1065356 G>A (LY6G6C), rs3749953 A>G (MSH5-SAPCD1 read through) and rs707926 G>A (VARS).

"gene","Association of the HLA-B*52 allele with non-progression to AIDS in Brazilian HIV-1-infected individuals","Several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I alleles are associated with the susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection and/or AIDS progression. Of these, the HLA-B alleles are considered the strongest genetic determinant of disease outcome. We evaluated the influence of the HLA-B alleles on AIDS progression among HIV-1-positive individuals from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, who were categorized as rapid progressors (RPs), typical progressors (TPs) or long-term non-progressors (LTNPs). In this study, significant differences in HLA-B allele frequencies were observed among the three progression groups for the B*48, B*49 and B*52 alleles. After controlling for other factors associated with AIDS progression, the presence of the B*52 allele was shown to be a significant protective factor (hazard ratio (HR) 0.49 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27–0.90) P<0.03). Although no direct association was observed between the presence of the B*27 or B*57 allele and the LTNP profile compared with the TP or RP groups, the adjusted model confirmed that these alleles are protective factors against AIDS progression (HR 0.62 (95% CI 0.38–0.99) P<0.05), as previously described. These data corroborate the existence of significant differences in HLA-B allele frequencies among the distinct AIDS progression profiles and further elucidate the role of HLA alleles in the outcome of HIV infections in diverse populations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201414"
"gene","MHC associations with clinical and autoantibody manifestations in European SLE","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a clinically heterogeneous disease affecting multiple organ systems and characterized by autoantibody formation to nuclear components. Although genetic variation within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is associated with SLE, its role in the development of clinical manifestations and autoantibody production is not well defined. We conducted a meta-analysis of four independent European SLE case collections for associations between SLE sub-phenotypes and MHC single-nucleotide polymorphism genotypes, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and variant HLA amino acids. Of the 11 American College of Rheumatology criteria and 7 autoantibody sub-phenotypes examined, anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibody subsets exhibited the highest number and most statistically significant associations. HLA-DRB1*03:01 was significantly associated with both sub-phenotypes. We found evidence of associations independent of MHC class II variants in the anti-Ro subset alone. Conditional analyses showed that anti-Ro and anti-La subsets are independently associated with HLA-DRB1*0301, and that the HLA-DRB1*03:01 association with SLE is largely but not completely driven by the association of this allele with these sub-phenotypes. Our results provide strong evidence for a multilevel risk model for HLA-DRB1*03:01 in SLE, where the association with anti-Ro and anti-La antibody-positive SLE is much stronger than SLE without these autoantibodies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene20146"
"gene","Comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression in T-cell subsets of rheumatoid arthritis patients reveals defined signatures of naive and memory Tregs","Disturbed expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulatory T cells (Tregs) leads to development of autoimmunity in experimental mouse models. However, the miRNA expression signature characterizing Tregs of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not been determined yet. In this study, we have used a microarray approach to comprehensively analyze miRNA expression signatures of both naive Tregs (CD4+CD45RO-CD25++) and memory Tregs (CD4+CD45RO+CD25+++), as well as conventional naive (CD4+CD45RO−CD25−) and memory (CD4+CD45RO+CD25−) T cells (Tconvs) derived from peripheral blood of RA patients and matched healthy controls. Differential expression of selected miRNAs was validated by TaqMan-based quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. We found a positive correlation between increased expression of miR-451 in T cells of RA patients and disease activity score (DAS28), erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels and serum levels of interleukin-6. Moreover, we found characteristic, disease- and treatment-independent, global miRNA expression signatures defining naive Tregs, memory Tregs, naive Tconvs and memory Tconvs. The analysis allowed us to define miRNAs characteristic for a general naive phenotype (for example, miR-92a) and a general memory phenotype (for example, miR-21, miR-155). Importantly, the analysis allowed us to define miRNAs that are specifically expressed in both naive and memory Tregs, defining as such miRNA signature characterizing the Treg phenotype (that is, miR-146a, miR-3162, miR-1202, miR-1246 and miR-4281).","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201369"
"gene","Contribution of IKBKE and IFIH1 gene variants to SLE susceptibility","The type I interferon system genes IKBKE and IFIH1 are associated with the risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). To identify the sequence variants that are able to account for the disease association, we resequenced the genes IKBKE and IFIH1. Eighty-six single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) with potentially functional effect or differences in allele frequencies between patients and controls determined by sequencing were further genotyped in 1140 SLE patients and 2060 controls. In addition, 108 imputed sequence variants in IKBKE and IFIH1 were included in the association analysis. Ten IKBKE SNVs and three IFIH1 SNVs were associated with SLE. The SNVs rs1539241 and rs12142086 tagged two independent association signals in IKBKE, and the haplotype carrying their risk alleles showed an odds ratio of 1.68 (P-value=1.0 × 10−5). The risk allele of rs12142086 affects the binding of splicing factor 1 in vitro and could thus influence its transcriptional regulatory function. Two independent association signals were also detected in IFIH1, which were tagged by a low-frequency SNV rs78456138 and a missense SNV rs3747517. Their joint effect is protective against SLE (odds ratio=0.56; P-value=6.6 × 10−3). In conclusion, we have identified new SLE-associated sequence variants in IKBKE and IFIH1, and proposed functional hypotheses for the association signals.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene20139"
"gene","Genetic variation in the serotonin receptor gene affects immune responses in rheumatoid arthritis","Many genetic variants associate with the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA); however, their functional roles are largely unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate whether the RA-associated serotonin receptor 2A (HTR2A) haplotype affects T-cell and monocyte functions. Patients with established RA (n=379) were genotyped for two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the HTR2A locus, rs6314 and rs1328674, to define presence of the risk haplotype for each individual. Patients with and without the RA-associated TC haplotype were selected and T-cell and monocyte function was monitored following in vitro stimulations with staphylococcal enterotoxin B and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) using multiparameter flow cytometry. Within the cohort, 44 patients were heterozygous for the TC haplotype (11.6%) while none were homozygous. Upon stimulation, T cells from TC-carrier patients produced more proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ)) and monocytes produced higher levels of TNF-α compared with patients carrying the non-TC haplotype (P<0.05 and 0.01, respectively). Such cytokine production could be inhibited in the presence of the selective 5-HT2 receptor agonist (2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, DOI); interestingly, this effect was more pronounced in TC carriers. Our data demonstrate that association of RA with a distinct serotonin receptor haplotype has functional impact by affecting the immunological phenotype of T cells and monocytes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201256"
"gene","Transcriptome characterization of immune suppression from battlefield-like stress","Transcriptome alterations of leukocytes from soldiers who underwent 8 weeks of Army Ranger training (RASP, Ranger Assessment and Selection Program) were analyzed to evaluate impacts of battlefield-like stress on the immune response. About 1400 transcripts were differentially expressed between pre- and post-RASP leukocytes. Upon functional analysis, immune response was the most enriched biological process, and most of the transcripts associated with the immune response were downregulated. Microbial pattern recognition, chemotaxis, antigen presentation and T-cell activation were among the most downregulated immune processes. Transcription factors predicted to be stress-inhibited (IRF7, RELA, NFκB1, CREB1, IRF1 and HMGB) regulated genes involved in inflammation, maturation of dendritic cells and glucocorticoid receptor signaling. Many altered transcripts were predicted to be targets of stress-regulated microRNAs. Post-RASP leukocytes exposed ex vivo to Staphylococcal enterotoxin B showed a markedly impaired immune response to this superantigen compared with pre-RASP leukocytes, consistent with the suppression of the immune response revealed by transcriptome analyses. Our results suggest that suppression of antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation pathways, in the setting of normal blood cell counts, most likely contribute to the poor vaccine response, impaired wound healing and infection susceptibility associated with chronic intense stress.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201249"
"gene","Variation in human genes encoding adhesion and proinflammatory molecules are associated with severe malaria in the Vietnamese","The genetic basis for susceptibility to malaria has been studied widely in African populations but less is known of the contribution of specific genetic variants in Asian populations. We genotyped 67 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1030 severe malaria cases and 2840 controls from Vietnam. After data quality control, genotyping data of 956 cases and 2350 controls were analysed for 65 SNPs (3 gender confirmation, 62 positioned in/near 42 malarial candidate genes). A total of 14 SNPs were monomorphic and 2 (rs8078340 and rs33950507) were not in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in controls (P<0.01). In all, 7/46 SNPs in 6 genes (ICAM1, IL1A, IL17RC, IL13, LTA and TNF) were associated with severe malaria, with 3/7 SNPs in the TNF/LTA region. Genotype–phenotype correlations between SNPs and clinical parameters revealed that genotypes of rs708567 (IL17RC) correlate with parasitemia (P=0.028, r2=0.0086), with GG homozygotes having the lowest parasite burden. Additionally, rs708567 GG homozygotes had a decreased risk of severe malaria (P=0.007, OR=0.78 (95% CI; 0.65–0.93)) and death (P=0.028, OR=0.58 (95% CI; 0.37–0.93)) than those with AA and AG genotypes. In summary, variants in six genes encoding adhesion and proinflammatory molecules are associated with severe malaria in the Vietnamese. Further replicative studies in independent populations will be necessary to confirm these findings.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201225"
"gene","Epiregulin (EREG) variation is associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis","Although host genetics influences susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the human genes regulating pathogenesis remain largely unknown. We used M. tuberculosis-stimulated macrophage gene expression profiling in conjunction with a case–control genetic association study to discover epiregulin (EREG), as a novel candidate tuberculosis (TB) susceptibility gene. Using a genome-wide association study dataset, we found that among the 21 genes with greater than 50-fold induction, EREG had the most polymorphisms associated with TB. We genotyped haplotype-tagging polymorphisms in discovery (N=337 cases, N=380 controls) and validation (N=332 cases) datasets and an EREG polymorphism (rs7675690) was associated with susceptibility to TB (genotypic comparison; corrected P=0.00007). rs7675690 was also associated more strongly with infections caused by the Beijing lineage of M. tuberculosis when compared with non-Beijing strains (controls vs Beijing, OR 7.81, P=8.7 × 10−5; non-Beijing, OR 3.13, P=0.074). Furthermore, EREG expression was induced in monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with M. tuberculosis as well as TLR4 and TLR2/1/6 ligands. In murine macrophages, EREG expression induced by M. tuberculosis was MYD88- and TLR2-dependent. Together, these data provide the first evidence for an important role for EREG as a susceptibility gene for human TB.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201183"
"gene","The role of SNPs in the α-chain of the IL-7R gene in CD4+ T-cell recovery in HIV-infected African patients receiving suppressive cART","We previously found an association between faster CD4+ T-cell recovery in HIV-infected patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and interleukin-7 receptor-α (IL-7Rα) haplotype-2 in a predominantly Caucasian cohort. This study aims to determine whether this association was also significant in Africans. Patients were recruited from the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment Outcomes (UARTO) cohort (n=352). We used survival analysis and linear mixed modelling (LMM) to determine factors associated with CD4 T-cell recovery. Eight IL-7Rα single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in both Africans and Caucasians (n=57). Soluble (s)IL-7Rα levels were measured by ELISA. In UARTO, IL-7Rα haplotype-2 was associated with slower CD4 T-cell recovery following cART by using survival analysis (P=0.020) and no association was found with LMM (P=0.958). The tagging-SNP for IL-7Rα haplotype-2 (rs6897932) was associated with decreased sIL-7Rα (P<0.001). The haplotypes for the IL-7Rα were significantly different in Africans and Caucasians. Using IL-7Rα genotypes we found slower CD4 T-cell recovery in UARTO patients was still associated with rs6897932 (P=0.009) and rs3194051 was associated with faster CD4 T-cell recovery (P=0.006). Unlike Caucasians, we did not demonstrate a significant association between IL-7Rα haplotype 2 and faster CD4 T-cell recovery in Africans. The IL-7Rα SNPs associated with CD4 T-cell recovery following cART differ in African and Caucasian cohorts.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201165"
"gene","Role of major histocompatibility complex class II in the development of autoimmune type 1 diabetes and thyroiditis in rats","Although the MHC class II ‘u’ haplotype is strongly associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in rats, the role of MHC class II in the development of tissue-specific autoimmune diseases including T1D and autoimmune thyroiditis remains unclear. To clarify this, we produced a congenic strain carrying MHC class II ‘a’ and ‘u’ haplotypes on the Komeda diabetes-prone (KDP) genetic background. The u/u homozygous animals developed T1D similar to the original KDP rat; a/u heterozygous animals did develop T1D but with delayed onset and low frequency. In contrast, none of the a/a homozygous animals developed T1D; about half of the animals with a/u heterozygous or a/a homozygous genotypes showed autoimmune thyroiditis. To investigate the role of genetic background in the development of thyroiditis, we also produced a congenic strain carrying Cblb mutation of the KDP rat on the PVG.R23 genetic background (MHC class II ‘a’ haplotype). The congenic rats with homozygous Cblb mutation showed autoimmune thyroiditis without T1D and slight to severe alopecia, a clinical symptom of hypothyroidism such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis. These data indicate that MHC class II is involved in the tissue-specific development of autoimmune diseases, including T1D and thyroiditis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201163"

In all, 24 patients with DM or PM were followed for up to 6 years (mean of 1.9 years) at 2–7 follow-up visits while receiving standard clinical care. Clinical data and blood samples collected at 80 patient visits were used for the analysis of cytokine-induced gene expression for the signaling pathways of type 1 interferon (IFN), tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1β, granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor, IL-10 and IL-13. A type 1 IFN signature score, but not other cytokine signature scores in the blood of patients with DM or PM, correlated highly with disease activity, decreased significantly with immunomodulatory therapies and showed concordant changes with major changes in disease activity. Type 1 IFN signature score in the blood correlates with disease activity in longitudinal follow-up of individual patients with DM or PM. The type 1 IFN-inducible gene transcripts in the blood have potential utility for monitoring disease activity in patients with DM or PM.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201161"
"gene","Toll-like receptor 4 region genetic variants are associated with susceptibility to melioidosis","Melioidosis is a tropical infection caused by the Gram-negative soil saprophyte Burkholderia pseudomallei. Despite broad exposure of northeastern Thais, disease develops in only a small proportion of individuals. Although diabetes is a risk factor, the mechanisms of host susceptibility to melioidosis are still poorly understood. We postulated that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) regulate host susceptibility to disease, and that genetic variation in TLRs is associated with melioidosis. We analyzed the frequency of eight previously described TLR pathway polymorphisms in 490 cases compared with 950 non-hospitalized controls or 458 hospitalized controls. Based on these results, we then analyzed the frequency of additional TLR4 or TLR6-1-10 region polymorphisms in cases and controls. We found that the TLR41196C>T variant was associated with protection from melioidosis when compared with non-hospitalized controls. The TLR1742A>G and TLR1−7202A>G variants were associated with melioidosis when compared with hospitalized controls. In further analyses, we found that two additional TLR4 region polymorphisms were associated with disease. In diabetics, three other TLR6-1-10 region polymorphisms were associated with disease when compared with hospitalized controls. We conclude that TLR genetic variants may modulate host susceptibility to melioidosis. Confirmation of these findings and further investigation of the mechanisms are required.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201149"
"gene","CLC and IFNAR1 are differentially expressed and a global immunity score is distinct between early- and late-onset colorectal cancer","Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence increases with age, and early onset of the disease is an indication of genetic predisposition, estimated to cause up to 30% of all cases. To identify genes associated with early-onset CRC, we investigated gene expression levels within a series of young patients with CRCs who are not known to carry any hereditary syndromes (n=24; mean 43 years at diagnosis), and compared this with a series of CRCs from patients diagnosed at an older age (n=17; mean 79 years). Two individual genes were found to be differentially expressed between the two groups, with statistical significance; CLC was higher and IFNAR1 was less expressed in early-onset CRCs. Furthermore, genes located at chromosome band 19q13 were found to be enriched significantly among the genes with higher expression in the early-onset samples, including CLC. An elevated immune content within the early-onset group was observed from the differentially expressed genes. By application of outlier statistics, H3F3A was identified as a top candidate gene for a subset of the early-onset CRCs. In conclusion, CLC and IFNAR1 were identified to be overall differentially expressed between early- and late-onset CRC, and are important in the development of early-onset CRC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201143"
"gene","An intracytoplasmic IL-10 receptor variant permits rapid reduction in STAT3 activation","Within the interleukin-10 receptor 1 (IL10R1) gene, two common variants are associated with certain diseases: single-nucleotide polymorphism 3 (SNP3), a serine-138 to glycine mutation is in linkage disequilibrium with SNP4, a glycine-330 to arginine mutation, both of which are considered loss-of-function alleles. However, the molecular consequence of G330R is unknown. We investigated possible roles of G330R on the dynamics of IL10R1 surface expression and signal transducer and activator of transduction (STAT) phosphorylation. HeLa cells expressing the respective IL10R1 haplotype were stimulated with IL-10. Significant reduction of IL10R1 surface expression was observed after ligand binding. Receptor expression remained low on continuous incubation with IL-10. In contrast, when treated with an IL-10 pulse, IL10R1 surface expression returned to its resting state within 3–9 h irrespective of the haplotype. STAT3 was rapidly phosphorylated both in cells with wild-type (WT) or variant IL10R1, and maintained phosphorylated when cells were cultured with IL-10. On IL-10 pulse, however, STAT3 phosphorylation declined rapidly in cells expressing IL10R1-G330R but not IL10R1-WT or S138G. Similar dynamics were observed with STAT1 phosphorylation at Tyr701. No differences in janus kinase 1 (JAK1) activation were observed in cells with WT or variant IL10R1. Our results indicate that IL10R1-G330R does not alter surface expression but duration of STAT phosphorylation, indicating that the position of G330 is important in stabilizing the STAT signal.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201112"
"gene","Fine mapping the TAGAP risk locus in rheumatoid arthritis","A common allele at the TAGAP gene locus demonstrates a suggestive, but not conclusive association with risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To fine map the locus, we conducted comprehensive imputation of CEU HapMap single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 5500 RA cases and 22 621 controls (all of European ancestry). After controlling for population stratification with principal components analysis, the strongest signal of association was to an imputed SNP, rs212389 (P=3.9 × 10−8, odds ratio=0.87). This SNP remained highly significant upon conditioning on the previous RA risk variant (rs394581, P=2.2 × 10−5) or on a SNP previously associated with celiac disease and type I diabetes (rs1738074, P=1.7 × 10−4). Our study has refined the TAGAP signal of association to a single haplotype in RA, and in doing so provides conclusive statistical evidence that the TAGAP locus is associated with RA risk. Our study also underscores the utility of comprehensive imputation in large GWAS data sets to fine map disease risk alleles.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene20118"
"gene","Risk alleles for chronic hepatitis B are associated with decreased mRNA expression of HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 in normal human liver","A genome-wide association study identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs3077 and rs9277535 located in the 3′ untranslated regions of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genes HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1, respectively, as the independent variants most strongly associated with chronic hepatitis B. We examined whether these SNPs are associated with mRNA expression of HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1. We identified gene expression-associated SNPs (eSNPs) in normal liver samples obtained from 651 individuals of European ancestry by integrating genotype (∼650 000 SNPs) and gene expression (>39 000 transcripts) data from each sample. We used the Kruskal–Wallis test to determine associations between gene expression and genotype. To confirm findings, we measured allelic expression imbalance (AEI) of complementary DNA compared with DNA in liver specimens from subjects who were heterozygous for rs3077 and rs9277535. On a genome-wide basis, rs3077 was the SNP most strongly associated with HLA-DPA1 expression (p=10−48), and rs9277535 was strongly associated with HLA-DPB1 expression (p=10−15). Consistent with these gene expression associations, we observed AEI for both rs3077 (p=3.0 × 10−7; 17 samples) and rs9277535 (p=0.001; 17 samples). We conclude that the variants previously associated with chronic hepatitis B are also strongly associated with mRNA expression of HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1, suggesting that expression of these genes is important in control of HBV.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201111"
"gene","IL28B genetic variations are associated with high sustained virological response (SVR) of interferon-α plus ribavirin therapy in Taiwanese chronic HCV infection","Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection patients exhibit different sustained virological responses (SVRs) following the treatment with pegylated interferon-α (IFN-α) and ribavirin. Genome-wide association studies consistently linked SVR of IFN-α-based therapy to the IL28B single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 19q.13 in various populations. This study was undertaken to investigate the association of IL28B SNPs with SVR in a cohort of Taiwanese chronic HCV patients. Ten SNPs of IL28B were genotyped in 728 chronic HCV patients and 960 healthy controls. Genotype distributions, allele frequencies and haplotypes were tested for SVR and susceptibility in Taiwanese chronic HCV patients. Non-genotype 1 infection (adjusted P=3.3 × 10−12, odds ratio (OR) 0.179; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.110–0.290) and low HCV viral load (<400 000 IU ml–1) (adjusted P=3.5 × 10−9, OR 0.299; 95% CI: 0.200–0.446) were two major factors identified for high SVR. Notably, eight IL28B SNPs including previously described disease-associated SNPs (Trend test P=0.005) were significantly associated with SVR. Our data indicate that IL28B polymorphisms are the essential contributing factors for high SVR in Taiwanese chronic HCV patients. Combination of virus genotyping and host genetic data may be used to select the optimal treatment regimes in IFN-based therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene20111"
"gene","Interferon-inducible gene 202b controls CD8+ T cell-mediated suppression in anti-DNA Ig peptide-treated (NZB × NZW) F1 lupus mice","Administration of an artificial peptide (pConsensus) based on anti-DNA IgG sequences that contain major histocompatibility complex class I and class II T-cell determinants, induces immune tolerance in NZB/NZW F1 female (BWF1) mice. To understand the molecular basis of CD8+ Ti-mediated suppression, we previously performed microarray analysis to identify genes that were differentially expressed following tolerance induction with pCons. CD8+ T cells from mice tolerized with pCons showed more than two-fold increase in Ifi202b mRNA, an interferon inducible gene, versus cells from untolerized mice. Ifi202b expression increased through weeks 1–4 after tolerization and then decreased, reapproaching baseline levels at 6 weeks. In vitro polyclonal activation of tolerized CD8+ T cells significantly increased Ifi202b mRNA expression. Importantly, silencing of Ifi202b abrogated the suppressive capacity of CD8+ Ti cells. This was associated with decreased expression of Foxp3, and decreased gene and protein expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)β and interleukin-2 (IL-2), but not of interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-10, or IL-17. Silencing of another IFN-induced gene upregulated in tolerized CD8+ T cells, IFNAR1, had no effect on the ability of CD8+ T cells to suppress autoantibody production. Our findings indicate a potential role for Ifi202b in the suppressive capacity of peptide-induced regulatory CD8+ Ti cells through effects on the expression of Foxp3 and the synthesis of TGFβ.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene20114"
"gene","The human G1m1 allotype associates with CD4+ T-cell responsiveness to a highly conserved IgG1 constant region peptide and confers an asparaginyl endopeptidase cleavage site","The human G1m1 allotype comprises two amino acids, D12 and L14, in the CH3 domain of IGHG1. Although the G1m1 allotype is prevalent in human populations, ∼40% of Caucasiods are homozygous for the nG1m1 allotype corresponding to E12 and M14. Peptides derived from the G1m1 region were tested for their ability to induce CD4+ T-cell proliferative responses in vitro. A peptide immediately downstream from the G1m1 sequence was recognized by CD4+ T cells in a large percentage of donors (peptide CH315−29). CD4+ T-cell proliferative responses to CH315−29 were found at an increased frequency in nG1m1 homozygous donors. Homozygous nG1m1 donors possessing the HLA-DRB1*07 allele displayed the highest magnitudes of proliferation. CD4+ T cells from donors homozygous for nG1m1 proliferated to G1m1-carrying Fc-fragment proteins, whereas CD4+ T cells from G1m1 homozygous donors did not. The G1m1 sequence creates an enzymatic cleavage site for asparaginyl endopeptidase in vitro. Proteolytic activity at D12 may allow the presentation of the CH315−29 peptide, which in turn may result in the establishment of tolerance to this peptide in G1m1-positive donors. Homozygous nG1m1 patients may be more likely to develop CD4+ T-cell-mediated immune responses to therapeutic antibodies carrying the G1m1 allotype.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201068"
"gene","Transcriptional repression and DNA looping associated with a novel regulatory element in the final exon of the lymphotoxin-β gene","Transcriptional regulation has a critical role in the coordinate and context-specific expression of a cluster of genes encoding members of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily found at chromosome 6p21, comprising TNF, LTA (encoding lymphotoxin-α) and LTB (encoding lymphotoxin-β). This is important, as dysregulated expression of these genes is implicated in susceptibility to many autoimmune, inflammatory and infectious diseases. We describe here a novel regulatory element in the fourth exon of LTB, which is highly conserved, localises to the only CpG island in the locus, and is associated with a DNase I hypersensitive site and specific histone modifications. We find evidence of binding by Yin Yang 1 (YY1), cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB) and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) to this region in Jurkat T cells, which is associated with transcriptional repression on reporter gene analysis. Chromatin conformation capture experiments show evidence of DNA looping, involving interaction of this element with the LTB promoter, LTA promoter and TNF 3′ untranslated region (UTR). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments demonstrate a functional role for YY1 and CREB in LTB expression. Our findings provide evidence of additional complexity in the transcriptional regulation of LTB with implications for coordinate expression of genes in this important genomic locus.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201062"
"gene","PTX3 genetic variations affect the risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway colonization in cystic fibrosis patients","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common life-threatening autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population, and the gene responsible is the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Patients with CF have repeated bacterial infection of the airways caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), which is one of the predominant pathogen, and endobronchial chronic infection represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is a gene that encodes the antimicrobial protein, PTX3, which is believed to have an important role in innate immunity of lung. To address the role of PTX3 in the risk of PA lung colonization, we investigated five single nucleotide polymorphisms of PTX3 gene in 172 Caucasian CF patients who were homozygous for the F508del mutation. We observed that PTX3 haplotype frequencies were significantly different between patients with PA colonization, as compared with noncolonized patients. Moreover, a protective effect was found in association with a specific haplotype (odds ratio 0.524). Our data suggest that variations within PTX3 affect lung colonization of Pseudomonas in patients with CF.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201041"
"gene","Surfing a genetic association interaction network to identify modulators of antibody response to smallpox vaccine","The variation in antibody response to vaccination likely involves small contributions of numerous genetic variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which interact in gene networks and pathways. To accumulate the bits of genetic information relevant to the phenotype that are distributed throughout the interaction network, we develop a network eigenvector centrality algorithm (SNPrank) that is sensitive to the weak main effects, gene–gene interactions and small higher-order interactions through hub effects. Analogous to Google PageRank, we interpret the algorithm as the simulation of a random SNP surfer (RSS) that accumulates bits of information in the network through a dynamic probabilistic Markov chain. The transition matrix for the RSS is based on a data-driven genetic association interaction network (GAIN), the nodes of which are SNPs weighted by the main-effect strength and edges weighted by the gene–gene interaction strength. We apply SNPrank to a GAIN analysis of a candidate-gene association study on human immune response to smallpox vaccine. SNPrank implicates a SNP in the retinoid X receptor α (RXRA) gene through a network interaction effect on antibody response. This vitamin A- and D-signaling mediator has been previously implicated in human immune responses, although it would be neglected in a standard analysis because its significance is unremarkable outside the context of its network centrality. This work suggests SNPrank to be a powerful method for identifying network effects in genetic association data and reveals a potential vitamin regulation network association with antibody response.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201037"
"gene","Association of the CCR5 gene with juvenile idiopathic arthritis","The CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) has been shown to be important in the recruitment of T-helper cells to the synovium, where they accumulate, drive the inflammatory process and the consequent synovitis and joint destruction. A 32 base-pair insertion/deletion variant (CCR5Δ32) within the gene leads to a frame shift and a nonfunctional receptor. CCR5Δ32 has been investigated for its association with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), with conflicting results. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CCR5Δ32 is associated with JIA in an UK population. CCR5Δ32 was genotyped in JIA cases (n=1054) and healthy controls (n=3129) and genotype and allele frequencies were compared. A meta-analysis of our study combined with previously published studies was performed. CCR5Δ32 was significantly associated with protection from developing JIA, in this UK data set (Ptrend=0.006, odds ratio (OR) 0.79 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.66–0.94). The meta-analysis of all published case–control association studies confirmed the protective association with JIA (P=0.001 OR 0.82 95% CI: 0.73–0.93). CCR5Δ32 is a functional variant determining the number of receptors on the surface of T cells, and it is hypothesized that the level of CCR5 expression could influence the migration of proinflammatory T cells into the synovium and thus susceptibility to JIA.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene201025"
"gene","Association of the AFF3 gene and IL2/IL21 gene region with juvenile idiopathic arthritis","Recent genetic studies have led to identification of numerous loci that are associated with susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. The strategy of using information from these studies has facilitated the identification of novel juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) susceptibility loci, specifically, PTPN22 and IL2RA. Several novel autoimmune susceptibility loci have recently been identified, and we hypothesise that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within these genes may also be JIA susceptibility loci. Five SNPs within the genes AFF3, IL2/IL21, IL7R, CTLA4 and CD226, previously associated with multiple autoimmune diseases were genotyped, in a large data set of Caucasian JIA patients and controls, and tested for association with JIA. We identified two susceptibility loci for JIA, AFF3 and the IL2/IL21 region and additional weak evidence supporting an association with the CTLA4 and IL7R genes, which warrant further investigation. All results require validation in independent JIA data sets. Further characterisation of the specific causal variants will be required before functional studies can be performed.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene2009105"
"gene","Insulin gene VNTR genotype associates with frequency and phenotype of the autoimmune response to proinsulin","Immune responses to autoantigens are in part controlled by deletion of autoreactive cells through genetically regulated selection mechanisms. We have directly analyzed peripheral CD4+ proinsulin (PI) 76–90 (SLQPLALEGSLQKRG)-specific T cells using soluble fluorescent major histocompatibility complex class II tetramers. Subjects with type I diabetes and healthy controls with high levels of peripheral proinsulin-specific T cells were characterized by the presence of a disease-susceptible polymorphism in the insulin variable number of tandem repeats (INS-VNTR) gene. Conversely, subjects with a ‘protective’ polymorphism in the INS-VNTR gene had nearly undetectable levels of proinsulin tetramer-positive T cells. These results strongly imply a direct relationship between genetic control of autoantigen expression and peripheral autoreactivity, in which proinsulin genotype restricts the quantity and quality of the potential T-cell response. Using a modified tetramer to isolate low-avidity proinsulin-specific T cells from subjects with the susceptible genotype, transcript arrays identified several induced pro-apoptotic genes in the control, but not diabetic subjects, likely representing a second peripheral mechanism for maintenance of tolerance to self antigens.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene2009108"
"gene","HLA-class I markers and multiple sclerosis susceptibility in the Italian population","Previous studies reported an association with multiple sclerosis (MS) of distinct HLA-class I markers, namely HLA-A*02, HLA-Cw*05 and MOG-142L. In this work, we tested the association with MS of A*02 and Cw*05 in 1273 Italian MS patients and 1075 matched controls, which were previously analyzed for MOG-142, and explored the relationship among these three markers in modulating MS risk. HLA-A*02 conferred a statistically robust MS protection (odds ratio, OR=0.61; 95% confidence intervals, CI=0.51–0.72, P<10−9), which was independent of DRB1*15 and of any other DRB1* allele and remained similar after accounting for the other two analyzed class I markers. Conversely, the protective effect we previously observed for MOG-142L was secondary to its linkage disequilibrium with A*02. Cw*05 was not associated considering the whole sample, but its presence significantly enhanced the protection in the HLA-A*02-positive group, independently of DRB1: the OR conferred by A*02 in Cw*05-positive individuals (0.22, 95% CI=0.13–0.38) was significantly lower than in Cw*05-negative individuals (0.69, 95% CI=0.58–0.83) with a significant (P=4.94 × 10−5) multiplicative interaction between the two markers. In the absence of A*02, Cw*05 behaved as a risk factor, particularly in combination with DRB1*03 (OR=3.89, P=0.0006), indicating that Cw*05 might be a marker of protective or risk haplotypes, respectively.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene2009101"
"gene","A functional SNP in the regulatory region of the decay-accelerating factor gene associates with extraocular muscle pareses in myasthenia gravis","Complement activation in myasthenia gravis (MG) may damage muscle endplate and complement regulatory proteins such as decay-accelerating factor (DAF) or CD55 may be protective. We hypothesize that the increased prevalence of severe extraocular muscle (EOM) dysfunction among African MG subjects reported earlier may result from altered DAF expression. To test this hypothesis, we screened the DAF gene sequences relevant to the classical complement pathway and found an association between myasthenics with EOM paresis and the DAF regulatory region c.-198C>G SNP (odds ratio=8.6; P=0.0003). This single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) results in a twofold activation of a DAF 5′-flanking region luciferase reporter transfected into three different cell lines. Direct matching of the surrounding SNP sequence within the DAF regulatory region with the known transcription factor-binding sites suggests a loss of an Sp1-binding site. This was supported by the observation that the c.-198C>G SNP did not show the normal lipopolysaccharide-induced DAF transcriptional upregulation in lymphoblasts from four patients. Our findings suggest that at critical periods during autoimmune MG, this SNP may result in inadequate DAF upregulation with consequent complement-mediated EOM damage. Susceptible individuals may benefit from anti-complement therapy in addition to immunosuppression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene200961"
"gene","Variation in the upstream region of P-Selectin (SELP) is a risk factor for SLE","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease. Genome-wide linkage studies implicated a region containing the adhesion molecule P-Selectin. This family-based study revealed two regions of association within P-Selectin. The strongest signal, from a 21.4-kb risk haplotype, stretched from the promoter into the first two consensus repeat (CR) regions (P=8 × 10−4), with a second association from a 14.6-kb protective haplotype covering CR 2–9 (P=0.0198). The risk haplotype is tagged by the rare C allele of rs3753306, which disrupts the binding site of the trans-activating transcription factor HNF-1. One other variant (rs3917687) on the risk haplotype was significant after permutation (P10000<1 × 10−5), replicated in independent pseudo case-control analysis and was significant by meta-analysis (P=4.37 × 10−6). A third associated variant on the risk haplotype (rs3917657) replicated in 306 US SLE families and was significant in a joint UK-SLE data set after permutation. The protective haplotype is tagged by rs6133 (a non-synonymous variant in CR8 (P=9.00 × 10−4), which also shows association in the pseudo case-control analysis (P=1.09 × 10−3) and may contribute to another signal in P-Selectin. We propose that polymorphism in the upstream region may reduce expression of P-Selectin, the mechanism by which this promotes autoimmunity is unknown, although it may reduce the production of regulatory T cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene200917"
"gene","Association of BANK1 and TNFSF4 with systemic lupus erythematosus in Hong Kong Chinese","Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a prototypic autoimmune disease with complex genetic inheritance. Recently, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BANK1 and TNFSF4 have been shown to be associated with SLE in Caucasian populations, but it is not known whether they are also involved in the disease in other ethnic groups. Recent data from our genome-wide association study (GWAS) for 314 SLE cases and 920 controls collected in Hong Kong identified SNPs in and around BANK1 and TNFSF4 to be associated with SLE risk. On the basis of the results of the reported studies and our GWAS, SNPs were selected for further genotyping in 949 SLE patients (overlapping with the 314 cases in our GWAS) and non-overlapping 1042 healthy controls. We confirmed the associations of BANK1 and TNFSF4 with SLE in Chinese (BANK1, rs3733197, odds ratio (OR)=0.84, P=0.021; BANK1, rs17266594, OR=0.61, P=4.67 × 10−9; TNFSF4, rs844648, OR=1.22, P=2.47 × 10−3; TNFSF4, rs2205960, OR=1.30, P=2.41 × 10−4). Another SNP located in intron 1 of BANK1, rs4522865, was separately replicated by Sequenom in 360 cases and 360 controls and was also confirmed to be associated with SLE (OR=0.725, P=2.93 × 10−3). Logistic regression analysis showed that rs3733197 (A383T in ankyrin domain) and rs17266594 (a branch point-site SNP) from BANK1 had independent contributions towards the disease association (P=0.037 and 6.63 × 10−8, respectively). In TNFSF4, rs2205960 was associated with SLE independently from the effect of rs844648 (P=6.26 × 10−3), but not vice versa (P=0.55). These findings suggest that multiple independent genetic variants may be present within the gene locus, which exert their effects on SLE pathogenesis through different mechanisms.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gene200916"
