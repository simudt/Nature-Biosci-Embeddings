"gt","Immunobiology of a rationally-designed AAV2 capsid following intravitreal delivery in mice","Adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) is a viral vector that can be used to deliver therapeutic genes to diseased cells in the retina. One strategy for altering AAV2 vectors involves the mutation of phosphodegron residues, which are thought to be phosphorylated/ubiquitinated in the cytosol, facilitating degradation of the vector and the inhibition of transduction. As such, mutation of phosphodegron residues have been correlated with increased transduction of target cells, however, an assessment of the immunobiology of wild-type and phosphodegron mutant AAV2 vectors following intravitreal (IVT) delivery to immunocompetent animals is lacking in the current literature. In this study, we show that IVT of a triple phosphodegron mutant AAV2 capsid is associated with higher levels of humoral immune activation, infiltration of CD4 and CD8 T-cells into the retina, generation of splenic germinal centre reactions, activation of conventional dendritic cell subsets, and elevated retinal gliosis compared to wild-type AAV2 capsids. However, we did not detect significant changes in electroretinography arising after vector administration. We also demonstrate that the triple AAV2 mutant capsid is less susceptible to neutralisation by soluble heparan sulphate and anti-AAV2 neutralising antibodies, highlighting a possible utility for the vector in terms of circumventing pre-existing humoral immunity. In summary, the present study highlights novel aspects of rationally-designed vector immunobiology, which may be relevant to their application in preclinical and clinical settings.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00409-x"
"gt","RapaCaspase-9-based suicide gene applied to the safety of IL-1RAP CAR-T cells","Even if adoptive cell transfer (ACT) has already shown great clinical efficiency in different types of disease, such as cancer, some adverse events consistently occur, and suicide genes are an interesting system to manage these events. Our team developed a new medical drug candidate, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeting interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP), which needs to be evaluated in clinical trials with a clinically applicable suicide gene system. To prevent side effects and ensure the safety of our candidate, we devised two constructs carrying an inducible suicide gene, RapaCasp9-G or RapaCasp9-A, containing a single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs1052576) affecting the efficiency of endogenous caspase 9. These suicide genes are activated by rapamycin and based on the fusion of human caspase 9 with a modified human FK-binding protein, allowing conditional dimerization. RapaCasp9-G- and RapaCasp9-A-expressing gene-modified T cells (GMTCs) were produced from healthy donors (HDs) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) donors. The RapaCasp9-G suicide gene demonstrated better efficiency, and we showed its in vitro functionality in different clinically relevant culture conditions. Moreover, as rapamycin is not pharmacologically inert, we also demonstrated its safe use as part of our therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00404-2"
"gt","Repeat or single-dose lentiviral vector administration to mouse lungs? It's all about the timing","Lentiviral vectors are attractive delivery vehicles for cystic fibrosis gene therapy owing to their low immunogenicity and ability to integrate into the host cell genome, thereby producing long-term, stable gene expression. Nonetheless, repeat dosing may be required to increase initial expression levels, and/or boost levels when they wane. The primary aim of this study was to determine if repeat dosing of a VSV-G pseudotyped LV vector delivered into mouse lungs is more effective than a single dose. C57Bl/6 mouse lungs were conditioned with lysophosphatidylcholine, followed one-hour later by a LV vector carrying the luciferase reporter gene, using six different short-term (≤1 wk) and long-term (>1 wk) dosing schedules. Luciferase expression was quantified using bioluminescence imaging over 12 months. Most dosing schedules produced detectable bioluminescence over the 12-month period, but the shorter intervals (≤1 wk) produced higher levels of flux than the longest interval (five doses at least 1-month apart). Ex vivo lung analysis at 12 months showed that the estimated mean flux for the group that received two doses 1-week apart was significantly greater than the single dose group and the two groups that received doses over a period greater than 1-week. These results suggest that early consecutive multiple doses are more effective at improving gene expression in mouse lungs at 12 months, than longer repeat dosing intervals.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00403-3"
"gt","Review of cardiac safety in onasemnogene abeparvovec gene replacement therapy: translation from preclinical to clinical findings","Human gene replacement therapies such as onasemnogene abeparvovec (OA) use recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors to treat monogenic disorders. The heart and liver are known target organs of toxicity in animals; with cardiac and hepatic monitoring recommended in humans after OA dosing. This manuscript provides a comprehensive description of cardiac data from preclinical studies and clinical sources including clinical trials, managed access programs and the post-marketing setting following intravenous OA administration through 23 May 2022. Single dose mouse GLP-Toxicology studies revealed dose-dependent cardiac findings including thrombi, myocardial inflammation and degeneration/regeneration, which were associated with early mortality (4-7 weeks) in the high dose groups. No such findings were documented in non-human primates (NHP) after 6 weeks or 6 months post-dose. No electrocardiogram or echocardiogram abnormalities were noted in NHP or humans. After OA dosing, some patients developed isolated elevations in troponin without associated signs/symptoms; the reported cardiac adverse events in patients were considered of secondary etiology (e.g. respiratory dysfunction or sepsis leading to cardiac events). Clinical data indicate cardiac toxicity observed in mice does not translate to humans. Cardiac abnormalities have been associated with SMA. Healthcare professionals should use medical judgment when evaluating the etiology and assessment of cardiac events post OA dosing so as to consider all possibilities and manage the patient accordingly.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00401-5"
"gt","rAAV-PHP.B escapes the mouse eye and causes lethality whereas rAAV9 can transduce aniridic corneal limbal stem cells without lethality","Recently safety concerns have been raised in connection with high doses of recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAV). Therefore, we undertook a series of experiments to test viral capsid (rAAV9 and rAAV-PHP.B), dose, and route of administration (intrastromal, intravitreal, and intravenous) focused on aniridia, a congenital blindness that currently has no cure. The success of gene therapy for aniridia may depend on the presence of functional limbal stem cells (LSCs) in the damaged aniridic corneas and whether rAAV can transduce them. Both these concerns were unknown, and thus were also addressed by our studies. For the first time, we report ataxia and lethality after intravitreal or intrastromal rAAV-PHP.B virus injections. We demonstrated virus escape from the eye and transduction of non-ocular tissues by rAAV9 and rAAV-PHP.B capsids. We have also shown that intrastromal and intravitreal delivery of rAAV9 can transduce functional LSCs, as well as all four PAX6-expressing retinal cell types in aniridic eye, respectively. Overall, lack of adverse events and successful transduction of LSCs and retinal cells makes it clear that rAAV9 is the capsid of choice for future aniridia gene therapy. Our finding of rAAV lethality after intraocular injections will be impactful for other researchers developing rAAV-based gene therapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00400-6"
"gt","Combinatorial gene therapy for epilepsy: Gene sequence positioning and AAV serotype influence expression and inhibitory effect on seizures","Gene therapy with AAV vectors carrying genes for neuropeptide Y and its receptor Y2 has been shown to inhibit seizures in multiple animal models of epilepsy. It is however unknown how the AAV serotype or the sequence order of these two transgenes in the expression cassette affects the actual parenchymal gene expression levels and the seizure-suppressant efficacy. To address these questions, we compared three viral vector serotypes (AAV1, AAV2 and AAV8) and two transgene sequence orders (NPY-IRES-Y2 and Y2-IRES-NPY) in a rat model of acutely induced seizures. Wistar male rats were injected bilaterally with viral vectors and 3 weeks later acute seizures were induced by a subcutaneous injection of kainate. The latency until 1st motor seizure, time spent in motor seizure and latency to status epilepticus were measured to evaluate the seizure-suppressing efficacy of these vectors compared to an empty cassette control vector. Based on the results, the effect of the AAV1-NPY-IRES-Y2 vector was further investigated by in vitro electrophysiology, and its ability to achieve transgene overexpression in resected human hippocampal tissue was evaluated. The AAV1-NPY-IRES-Y2 proved to be better to any other serotype or gene sequence considering both transgene expression and ability to suppress induced seizures in rats. The vector also demonstrated transgene-induced decrease of glutamate release from excitatory neuron terminals and significantly increased both NPY and Y2 expression in resected human hippocampal tissue from patients with drug-resistant temporal lobe epilepsy. These results validate the feasibility of NPY/Y2 receptor gene therapy as a therapeutic opportunity in focal epilepsies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00399-w"
"gt","Large-scale purification of functional AAV particles packaging the full genome using short-term ultracentrifugation with a zonal rotor","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-based gene therapy is potentially curative for various genetic diseases; however, the development of a scalable purification method for full-genome AAV vectors remains crucial to increase productivity and reduce cost of GMP production. In this study, we developed a large-scale short-term purification method for functional full-genome AAV particles by using 2-step cesium chloride (CsCl) density-gradient ultracentrifugation with a zonal rotor. The 2-step CsCl method with a zonal rotor improves separation between empty and full-genome AAV particles, reducing the ultracentrifugation time (4–5 h) and increasing the AAV volume for purification. The highly purified full-genome AAV particles were confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in the whole region of the AAV vector genome, transduction efficiency in target cells, and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). The high-purity AAV9 particles were obtained using culture supernatant during vector preparation rather than cell lysate. CsCl could be simply removed by a hydroxyapatite column. Interestingly, ddPCR analysis revealed that “empty” AAV particles contain small fragments of the inverted terminal repeat (ITR), probably due to unexpected packaging of Rep-mediated ITR fragments. This large-scale functional AAV vector purification with ultracentrifugation would be effective for gene therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00398-x"
"gt","Terminal hairpins improve protein expression in IRES-initiated mRNA in the absence of a cap and polyadenylated tail","Synthesizing mRNA in vitro is a standard and simple procedure. Adding the 5' cap and 3' polyadenylated (poly(A)) tail to make this mRNA functional for use as a vaccine or therapy increases the time and cost of production and usually decreases the yield, however. We designed mRNA that lacked a cap and poly(A) tail but included an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) to initiate protein translation. To protect the 5′ and 3′ ends of mRNA from exonucleases, we added stable terminal hairpins. When compared against typical mRNA (i.e., mRNA that contained a cap and poly(A) tail but lacked hairpins), expression of the delivered reporter protein in HEK293 cells was similar. Using a triple instead of a single hairpin at each end increased protein expression even more. This method has the potential to simplify the production and reduce the cost of synthesizing exogenous mRNA for use as biologics or vaccines.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-023-00391-4"
"gt","Improving adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector-mediated transgene expression in retinal ganglion cells: comparison of five promoters","Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) are an effective system for gene transfer. AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) is commonly used to deliver transgenes to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) via intravitreal injection. The AAV serotype however is not the only factor contributing to the effectiveness of gene therapies. Promoters influence the strength and cell-selectivity of transgene expression. This study compares five promoters designed to maximise AAV2 cargo space for gene delivery: chicken β-actin (CBA), cytomegalovirus (CMV), short CMV early enhancer/chicken β-actin/short β-globulin intron (sCAG), mouse phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and human synapsin (SYN). The promoters driving enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were examined in adult C57BL/6J mice eyes and tissues of the visual system. eGFP expression was strongest in the retina, optic nerves and brain when driven by the sCAG and SYN promoters. CBA, CMV, and PGK had moderate expression by comparison. The SYN promoter had almost exclusive transgene expression in RGCs. The PGK promoter had predominant expression in both RGCs and AII amacrine cells. The ubiquitous CBA, CMV, and sCAG promoters expressed eGFP in a variety of cell types across multiple retinal layers including Müller glia and astrocytes. We also found that these promoters could transduce human retina ex vivo, although expression was predominantly in glial cells due to low RGC viability. Taken together, this promoter comparison study contributes to optimising AAV-mediated transduction in the retina, and could be valuable for research in ocular disorders, particularly those with large or complex genetic cargos.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00380-z"
"gt","Preclinical evaluation of FLT190, a liver-directed AAV gene therapy for Fabry disease","Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by loss of alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity and is characterized by progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipids in multiple cells and tissues. FLT190, an investigational gene therapy, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with Fabry disease (NCT04040049). FLT190 consists of a potent, synthetic capsid (AAVS3) containing an expression cassette with a codon-optimized human GLA cDNA under the control of a liver-specific promoter FRE1 (AAV2/S3-FRE1-GLAco). For mouse studies FLT190 genome was pseudotyped with AAV8 for efficient transduction. Preclinical studies in a murine model of Fabry disease (Gla-deficient mice), and non-human primates (NHPs) showed dose-dependent increases in plasma α-Gal A with steady-state observed 2 weeks following a single intravenous dose. In Fabry mice, AAV8-FLT190 treatment resulted in clearance of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) in plasma, urine, kidney, and heart; electron microscopy analyses confirmed reductions in storage inclusion bodies in kidney and heart. In NHPs, α-Gal A expression was consistent with the levels of hGLA mRNA in liver, and no FLT190-related toxicities or adverse events were observed. Taken together, these studies demonstrate preclinical proof-of-concept of liver-directed gene therapy with FLT190 for the treatment of Fabry disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00381-y"
"gt","Glyco-binding domain chimeric antigen receptors as a new option for cancer immunotherapy","In the last decade, treatment using Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) are largely studied and demonstrate the potential of immunotherapeutic strategies, as seen mainly for blood related cancers. Still, efficient CAR-T cell approaches especially for the treatment of solid tumors are needed. Tn- and Sialyl-Tn antigens are tumor associated carbohydrate antigens correlating with poor prognosis and tumor metastasis on a variety of tumor entities. These glycans can be recognized by CD301 (CLEC10A, MGL), which is a surface receptor found primarily on immune cells. In the present study, we hypothesized, that it is possible to use newly generated CD301-bearing CARs, enabling cytotoxic effector cells to recognize and eliminate breast cancer cells. Thus, we genetically modified human NK92 cells with different chimeric receptors based on the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) of human CD301. We assessed their cytotoxic activity in vitro demonstrating the specific recognition of CD301 ligand positive cell lines. These results were confirmed by degranulation assays and in cytokine release assays. Overall, this study demonstrates CD301-CARs represent a cost-effective and fast alternative to conventional scFv CARs for cancer immunotherapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00374-x"

"gt","Survey of perspectives of people with inherited retinal diseases on ocular gene therapy in Australia","Many gene therapies are in development for treating people with inherited retinal diseases (IRD). We hypothesized that potential recipients of gene therapy would have knowledge gaps regarding treatment. We aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of genetic therapies among potential recipients with IRD, using a novel instrument we designed (Attitudes to Gene Therapy-Eye (AGT-Eye)) and their associations with demographic data, self-reported visual status, and tools assessing quality of life and attitudes toward clinical trials using a community-based cross-sectional survey of Australian adults with IRD. AGT-Eye, overall quality of life EQ-5D-5L, National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) and Patient Attitudes to Clinical Trials (PACT-22) instruments were administered. Six hundred and eighty-one people completed the study, 51.7% women of mean age 53.5 years (SD ± 15.8). Most participants (91.6%) indicated they would likely accept gene therapy if it was available to them or family members. However, only 28.3% agreed that they had good knowledge of gene therapy. Most obtained information about gene therapy from the internet (49.3%). Respondents with post-graduate degrees scored highest compared to other educational levels on methods (p < 0.001) and outcomes (p = 0.003) and were more likely to see economic value of treatment (p = 0.043). Knowledge gaps were present regarding methods and outcomes of gene therapy. This survey has shown high level of interest in the IRD community for gene therapies, and highlights areas for improved clinician and patient education.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00364-z"
"gt","Multiplex viral tropism assay in complex cell populations with single-cell resolution","Gene therapy constitutes one of the most promising mode of disease treatments. Two key properties for therapeutic delivery vectors are its transduction efficiency (how well the vector delivers therapeutic cargo to desired target cells) and specificity (how well it avoids off-target delivery into unintended cells within the body). Here we developed an integrated bioinformatics and experimental pipeline that enables multiplex measurement of transduction efficiency and specificity, particularly by measuring how libraries of delivery vectors transduce libraries of diverse cell types. We demonstrated that pairing high-throughput measurement of AAV identity with high-resolution single-cell RNA transcriptomic sequencing maps how natural and engineered AAV variants transduce individual cells within human cerebral and ocular organoids. We further demonstrate that efficient AAV transduction observed in organoids is recapitulated in vivo in non-human primates. This library-on-library technology will be important for determining the safety and efficacy of therapeutic delivery vectors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00360-3"
"gt","Preclinical assessment of antigen-specific chimeric antigen receptor regulatory T cells for use in solid organ transplantation","A primary goal in transplantation medicine is the induction of a tolerogenic environment for prevention of transplant rejection without the need for long-term pharmacological immunosuppression. Generation of alloantigen-specific regulatory T cells (Tregs) by transduction with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) is a promising strategy to achieve this goal. This publication reports the preclinical characterization of Tregs (TR101) transduced with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*02 CAR lentiviral vector (TX200) designated to induce immunosuppression of allograft-specific effector T cells in HLA-A*02-negative recipients of HLA-A*02-positive transplants. In vitro results demonstrated specificity, immunosuppressive function, and safety of TX200-TR101. In NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice, TX200-TR101 prevented graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in a xenogeneic GvHD model and TX200-TR101 Tregs localized to human HLA-A*02-positive skin transplants in a transplant model. TX200-TR101 persisted over the entire duration of a 3-month study in humanized HLA-A*02 NSG mice and remained stable, without switching to a proinflammatory phenotype. Concomitant tacrolimus did not impair TX200-TR101 Treg survival or their ability to inhibit peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) engraftment. These data demonstrate that TX200-TR101 is specific, stable, efficacious, and safe in preclinical models, and provide the basis for a first-in-human study.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00358-x"
"gt","Clinical enrollment assay to detect preexisting neutralizing antibodies to AAV6 with demonstrated transgene expression in gene therapy trials","Recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are the leading platform for gene delivery for a variety of clinical applications. Patients with preexisting antibodies to AAV are currently excluded from most AAV gene therapy trials to avoid vector neutralization and ensure response to therapy. Anti-AAV neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) are typically assessed by in vitro cell-based transduction inhibition (TI) assays. However, clinical relevance of the determined enrollment cutoff and the inherent variability of a cell-based assay present challenges for use as an enrollment screening test. Here, we describe an enrollment cutoff that was clinically validated and strategies to overcome assay challenges to enable long-term stable performance. A validated anti-AAV6 cell-based TI assay was used to support clinical enrollment across multiple investigational gene therapies and to evaluate AAV6 seroprevalence in healthy and disease populations. The clinical enrollment cutoff was determined statistically using samples collected from healthy donors, applying a 0.1% false error rate with the inclusion of a minimum significant ratio (MSR) metric and in consideration of results from in vivo mouse passive transfer studies. Our strategy for long-term monitoring and control of assay performance employed plate quality control samples flanking the predefined cutoff. An approach using donor samples was implemented to bridge different lots of critical reagents without the need to redefine the cutoff.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00353-2"
"gt","Splicing mutations in the CFTR gene as therapeutic targets","The marketing approval, about ten years ago, of the first disease modulator for patients with cystic fibrosis harboring specific CFTR genotypes (~5% of all patients) brought new hope for their treatment. To date, several therapeutic strategies have been approved and the number of CFTR mutations targeted by therapeutic agents is increasing. Although these drugs do not reverse the existing disease, they help to increase the median life expectancy. However, on the basis of their CFTR genotype, ~10% of patients presently do not qualify for any of the currently available CFTR modulator therapies, particularly patients with splicing mutations (~12% of the reported CFTR mutations). Efforts are currently made to develop therapeutic agents that target disease-causing CFTR variants that affect splicing. This highlights the need to fully identify them by scanning non-coding regions and systematically determine their functional consequences. In this review, we present some examples of CFTR alterations that affect splicing events and the different therapeutic options that are currently developed and tested for splice switching.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00347-0"
"gt","Onasemnogene abeparvovec gene replacement therapy for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy: a real-world observational study","Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a genetically inherited recessive neuromuscular disease that causes muscular atrophy and weakness. Onasemnogene abeparvovec (formerly AVXS-101, Zolgensma®, Novartis) is a targeted therapy approved to treat patients with SMA in >40 countries worldwide. This study describes the clinical efficacy and tolerability of gene replacement therapy with onasemnogene abeparvovec over a 3-month period in 9 SMA type 1 patients aged 1.7–48 months, with 7 patients on stable nusinersen (i.e., had received all four nusinersen loading doses before inclusion in this study). Liver function (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin), troponin I, platelet counts, creatinine levels, and motor function (CHOP-INTEND) were monitored. For the seven patients on stable nusinersen, the median baseline CHOP-INTEND score increased significantly during nusinersen treatment (Wilcoxon signed-rank test p = 0.018) and at 3 months after switching to onasemnogene abeparvovec (Wilcoxon signed-rank test p = 0.0467). We also identified two patients who responded poorly to nusinersen but showed the largest increase in baseline CHOP-INTEND scores at 1 and 3 months after switching, which could suggest that poor responders to nusinersen may respond favorably to onasemnogene abeparvovec. No unknown adverse events occurred. One patient developed moderate/severe thrombocytopenia 1 week after onasemnogene abeparvovec administration that resolved after treatment. Our study suggests the possibility of a change in the dynamic of CHOP-INTEND for patients who respond poorly to nusinersen after switching therapy to onasemnogene abeparvovec. Alternatively, patient age at treatment initiation may impact the response to onasemnogene abeparvovec. Testing in larger patient populations must be undertaken to assess the plausibility of these hypotheses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00341-6"
"gt","Enzymatically amplified linear dbDNATM as a rapid and scalable solution to industrial lentiviral vector manufacturing","Traditional bacterial fermentation techniques used to manufacture plasmid are time-consuming, expensive, and inherently unstable. The production of sufficient GMP grade material thus imposes a major bottleneck on industrial-scale manufacturing of lentiviral vectors (LVV). Touchlight’s linear doggybone DNA (dbDNATM) is an enzymatically amplified DNA vector produced with exceptional speed through an in vitro dual enzyme process, enabling industrial-scale manufacturing of GMP material in a fraction of the time required for plasmid. We have previously shown that dbDNATM can be used to produce functional LVV; however, obtaining high LVV titres remained a challenge. Here, we aimed to demonstrate that dbDNATM could be optimised for the manufacture of high titre LVV. We found that dbDNATM displayed a unique transfection and expression profile in the context of LVV production, which necessitated the optimisation of DNA input and construct ratios. Furthermore, we demonstrate that efficient 3’ end processing of viral genomic RNA (vgRNA) derived from linear dbDNATM transfer vectors required the addition of a strong 3’ termination signal and downstream spacer sequence to enable efficient vgRNA packaging. Using these improved vector architectures along with optimised transfection conditions, we were able to produce a CAR19h28z LVV with equivalent infectious titres as achieved using plasmid, demonstrating that dbDNATM technology can provide a highly effective solution to the plasmid bottleneck.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00343-4"

"gt","HIV- 1 lentivirus tethering to the genome is associated with transcription factor binding sites found in genes that favour virus survival","Lentiviral vectors (LV) are attractive for permanent and effective gene therapy. However, integration into the host genome can cause insertional mutagenesis highlighting the importance of understanding of LV integration. Insertion site (IS) tethering is believed to involve cellular proteins such as PSIP1/LEDGF/p75, which binds to the virus pre-integration complexes (PICs) helping to target the virus genome. Transcription factors (TF) that bind both the vector LTR and host genome are also suspected influential to this. To determine the role of TF in the tethering process, we mapped predicted transcription factor binding sites (pTFBS) near to IS chosen by HIV-1 LV using a narrow 20 bp window in infected human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their hepatocyte-like cell (HLC) derivatives. We then aligned the pTFBS with these sequences found in the LTRs of native and self-inactivated LTRs. We found significant enrichment of these sequences for pTFBS essential to HIV-1 life cycle and virus survival. These same sites also appear in HIV-1 patient IS and in mice infected with HIV-1 based LV. This in silco data analysis suggests pTFBS present in the virus LTR and IS sites selected by HIV-1 LV are important to virus survival and propagation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00335-4"

"gt","Effective viral-mediated lung gene therapy: is airway surface preparation necessary?","Gene-based therapeutics are actively being pursued for the treatment of lung diseases. While promising advances have been made over the last decades, the absence of clinically available lung-directed genetic therapies highlights the difficulties associated with this effort. Largely, progress has been hindered by the presence of inherent physical and physiological airway barriers that significantly reduce the efficacy of gene transfer. These barriers include surface mucus, mucociliary action, cell-to-cell tight junctions, and the basolateral cell membrane location of viral receptors for many commonly used gene vectors. Accordingly, airway surface preparation methods have been developed to disrupt these barriers, creating a more conducive environment for gene uptake into the target airway cells. The two major approaches have been chemical and physical methods. Both have proven effective for increasing viral-mediated gene transfer pre-clinically, although with variable effect depending on the specific strategy employed. While such methods have been explored extensively in experimental settings, they have not been used clinically. This review covers the airway surface preparation strategies reported in the literature, the advantages and disadvantages of each method, as well as a discussion about applying this concept in the clinic.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00332-7"
"gt","Exon skipping induced by CRISPR-directed gene editing regulates the response to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung carcinoma cells","We have been developing CRISPR-directed gene editing as an augmentative therapy for the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) by genetic disruption of Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (NRF2). NRF2 promotes tumor cell survival in response to therapeutic intervention and thus its disablement should restore or enhance effective drug action. Here, we report how NRF2 disruption leads to collateral damage in the form of CRISPR-mediated exon skipping. Heterogeneous populations of transcripts and truncated proteins produce a variable response to chemotherapy, dependent on which functional domain is missing. We identify and characterize predicted and unpredicted transcript populations and discover that several types of transcripts arise through exon skipping; wherein one or two NRF2 exons are missing. In one specific case, the presence or absence of a single nucleotide determines whether an exon is skipped or not by reorganizing Exonic Splicing Enhancers (ESEs). We isolate and characterize the diversity of clones induced by CRISPR activity in a NSCLC tumor cell population, a critical and often overlooked genetic byproduct of this exciting technology. Finally, gRNAs must be designed with care to avoid altering gene expression patterns that can account for variable responses to solid tumor therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00324-7"
"gt","Toward gene therapy of Laron syndrome","The growth hormone (GH)-insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) endocrine axis has a fundamental role in growth and development throughout life [1,2,3]. As originally postulated by Salmon and Daughaday in the mid-1950s, most of the biological actions of GH are mediated by a liver-produced peptide initially termed somatomedin and, subsequently, IGF1 [4]. IGF1 is structurally and evolutionarily related to the insulin molecule. IGF1 developed early in evolution, probably as a regulator of cellular proliferation in relation to nutrient availability.

"gt","Insidious Insights: Implications of viral vector engineering for pathogen enhancement","Optimizing viral vectors and their properties will be important for improving the effectiveness and safety of clinical gene therapy. However, such research may generate dual-use insights relevant to the enhancement of pandemic pathogens. In particular, reliable and generalizable methods of immune evasion could increase viral fitness sufficient to cause a new pandemic. High potential for misuse is associated with (1) the development of universal genetic elements for immune modulation, (2) specific insights on capsid engineering for antibody evasion applicable to viruses with pandemic potential, and (3) the development of computational methods to inform capsid engineering. These risks may be mitigated by prioritizing non-viral delivery systems, pharmacological immune modulation methods, non-genetic vector surface modifications, and engineering methods specific to AAV and other viruses incapable of unassisted human-to-human transmission. We recommend that computational vector engineering and the publication of associated code and data be limited to AAV until a technical solution for preventing malicious access to viral engineering tools has been established.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00312-3"
"gt","Lentiviral standards to determine the sensitivity of assays that quantify lentiviral vector copy numbers and genomic insertion sites in cells","With an increasing number of gene therapy clinical trials and drugs reaching the market, it becomes important to standardize the methods that evaluate the efficacy and safety of gene therapy. We herein report the generation of lentiviral standards which are stable, cloned human cells prepared from the diploid HCT116 cell line and which carry a known number of lentiviral vector copies in their genome. These clones can be used as reference cellular materials for the calibration or qualification of analytical methods that quantify vector copy numbers in cells (VCN) or lentiviral vector genomic integration sites (IS). Cellular standards were used to show the superior precision of digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) over quantitative PCR (qPCR) for VCN determination. This enabled us to develop a new sensitive and specific VCN ddPCR method specific for the integrated provirus and not recognizing the transfer plasmid. The cellular standards, were also useful to assess the sensitivity and limits of a ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR) method to measure IS showing that at least 1% abundance of a single IS can be detected in a polyclonal population but that not all IS can be amplified with similar efficiency. Thus, lentiviral standards should be systematically used in all assays that assess lentiviral gene therapy efficacy and safety.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00315-8"

Herein, we assessed the potential for germline transmission of AAV5-hFVIII-SQ in mice. Male B6.129S6-Rag2tm1Fwa N12 mice received a single intravenous dose of vehicle or 6 × 1013 vg/kg AAV5-hFVIII-SQ. Vehicle and AAV5-hFVIII-SQ-treated mice were mated with naïve females 4 days after dosing, when the concentration of vector genomes was expected to be at its peak in semen, and 37 days after dosing, when a full spermatogenesis cycle was estimated to be complete. Quantitative PCR was used to evaluate the presence of transgene DNA in liver and testes from F0 males dosed with AAV5-hFVIII-SQ and liver tissue of F1 offspring. Transgene DNA was detected in liver and testes of all F0 males dosed with AAV5-hFVIII-SQ, confirming successful transduction. Importantly, no transgene DNA was detected in any tested F1 offspring derived from F0 males dosed with AAV5-hFVIII-SQ. Using a novel 2-stage statistical model that takes into account the number of males dosed with AAV5-hFVIII-SQ and the number of offspring sired by these males, we estimate that the risk of germline transmission is <5% with a 99.2% confidence level.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00318-5"
"gt","AAV2-VEGF-B gene therapy failed to induce angiogenesis in ischemic porcine myocardium due to inflammatory responses","Therapeutic angiogenesis induced by gene therapy is a promising approach to treat patients suffering from severe coronary artery disease. In small experimental animals, adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) have shown good transduction efficacy and long-term transgene expression in heart muscle and other tissues. However, it has been difficult to achieve cardiac-specific angiogenic effects with AAV vectors. We tested the hypothesis whether AAV2 gene transfer (1 × 1013 vg) of vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGF-B186) together with immunosuppressive corticosteroid treatment can induce long-term cardiac-specific therapeutic effects in the porcine ischemic heart. Gene transfers were delivered percutaneously using direct intramyocardial injections, improving targeting and avoiding direct contact with blood, thus reducing the likelihood of immediate immune reactions. After 1- and 6-month time points, the capillary area was analyzed, myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) was measured with radiowater positron emission tomography ([15O]H2O-PET), and fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) uptake was used to evaluate myocardial viability. Clinical chemistry and immune responses were analyzed using standard methods. After 1- and 6-month follow-up, AAV2-VEGF-B186 gene transfer failed to induce angiogenesis and improve myocardial perfusion and viability. Here, we show that inflammatory responses attenuated the therapeutic effect of AAV2 gene transfer by significantly reducing successful transduction and long-term gene expression despite the efforts to reduce the likelihood of immune reactions and the use of targeted local gene transfer methods.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00322-9"

The response is suboptimal and associated with progressive obesity. In this study, we treated 4–5-week-old Laron dwarf mice (GHR−/−) with an adeno-associated virus expressing murine GHR (AAV-GHR) injection at a dose of 4 × 1010 vector genome per mouse. Serum growth hormone (GH) levels decreased, and GH-responsive IGF1, IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) and acid labile subunit (ALS) increased. There was a significant but limited increase in body weight and length, similar to the response to rhIGF1 treatment in LS patients. All the major organs increased in weight except the brain. Our study is the first to use gene therapy to treat GH-receptor deficiency. We propose that gene therapy with AAV-GHR may eventually be useful for the treatment of human LS.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00313-w"
"gt","Antisense oligonucleotides as a potential treatment for brain deficits observed in myotonic dystrophy type 1","Myotonic dystrophy, or dystrophia myotonica type 1 (DM1), is a multi-systemic disorder and is the most common adult form of muscular dystrophy. It affects not only muscles but also many organs, including the brain. Cerebral impairments include cognitive deficits, daytime sleepiness, and loss of visuospatial and memory functions. The expression of mutated transcripts with CUG repeats results in a gain of toxic mRNA function. The antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) strategy to treat DM1 brain deficits is limited by the fact that ASOs do not cross the blood–brain barrier after systemic administration, indicating that other methods of delivery should be considered. ASO technology has emerged as a powerful tool for developing potential new therapies for a wide variety of human diseases, and its potential has been proven in a recent clinical trial. Targeting DMPK mRNA in neural cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells obtained from a DM1 patient with the IONIS 486178 ASO abolished CUG-expanded foci, enabled nuclear redistribution of MBNL1/2, and corrected aberrant splicing. Intracerebroventricular injection of the IONIS 486178 ASO in DMSXL mice decreased the levels of mutant DMPK mRNAs by up to 70% throughout different brain regions. It also reversed behavioral abnormalities following neonatal administration. The present study indicated that the IONIS 486178 ASO targets mutant DMPK mRNAs in the brain and strongly supports the feasibility of a therapy for DM1 patients based on the intrathecal injection of an ASO.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00316-7"
"gt","Getting the upper hand in ALS","Ubiquitin is perhaps the most aptly described molecule—ubiquitous to tissues throughout the body. Multiple copies of ubiquitin (polyubiquitin) tag proteins for degradation and this plays an important role in various neurodegenerative diseases. This discovery earned a Nobel prize and has become a critical area of research and drug discovery. Genc et al. provide strong evidence that UCHL1—an enzyme crucial for regulating polyubiquinated proteins at multiple levels—may be able to reverse degeneration of upper motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), one of the most aggressive neurodegenerative diseases. ALS, defined by Charcot in 1869, has to involve the loss of both upper and lower motor neurons leading to paralysis of voluntary muscles over a period of 3–5 years. While ~10% of all ALS cases are associated with specific gene mutations involving C9orf72, TDP-43 and SOD1 and others, the majority are “sporadic” with no known genetic origin. ALS is also now considered a proteinopathy with TDP-43 as the central player.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-022-00314-9"
"gt","A short hepatitis C virus NS5A peptide expression by AAV vector modulates human T cell activation and reduces vector immunogenicity","Viral vector-mediated gene therapies have the potential to treat many human diseases; however, host immune responses against the vector and/or the transgene pose a safety risk to the patients and can negatively impact product efficacy. Thus, novel strategies to reduce vector immunogenicity are critical for the advancement of these therapies. T cell activation (TCA) is required for the development of immune responses during gene therapy. We hypothesized that modulation of TCA by incorporating a novel viral immunomodulatory factor into a viral vector may reduce unwanted TCA and immune responses during gene therapy. To test this hypothesis, we identified an immunomodulatory domain of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS protein 5A (NS5A) protein and studied the effect of viral vectors expressing NS5A peptide on TCA. Lentiviral vector-mediated expression of a short 20-mer peptide derived from the NS5A protein in human T cells was sufficient to inhibit TCA. Synthetic 20-mer NS5A peptide also inhibited TCA in primary human T cells. Mechanistically, the NS5A protein interacted with Lck and inhibited proximal TCR signaling. Importantly, NS5A peptide expression did not cause global T cell signaling dysfunction as distal T cell signaling was not inhibited. Finally, recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expressing the 20-mer NS5A peptide reduced both the recall antigen and the TCR-mediated activation of human T cells and did not cause global T cell signaling dysfunction. Together, these data suggest that expression of a 20-mer NS5A peptide by an AAV vector may reduce unwanted TCA and may contribute to lower vector immunogenicity during gene therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00302-5"
"gt","Dystrophin and mini-dystrophin quantification by mass spectrometry in skeletal muscle for gene therapy development in Duchenne muscular dystrophy","Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a lethal, degenerative muscle disorder caused by mutations in the DMD gene, leading to severe reduction or absence of the protein dystrophin. Gene therapy strategies that aim to increase expression of a functional dystrophin protein (mini-dystrophin) are under investigation. The ability to accurately quantify dystrophin/mini-dystrophin is essential in assessing the level of gene transduction. We demonstrated the validation and application of a novel peptide immunoaffinity liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (IA-LC-MS/MS) assay. Data showed that dystrophin expression in Becker muscular dystrophy and DMD tissues, normalized against the mean of non-dystrophic control tissues (n = 20), was 4–84.5% (mean 32%, n = 20) and 0.4–24.1% (mean 5%, n = 20), respectively. In a DMD rat model, biceps femoris tissue from dystrophin-deficient rats treated with AAV9.hCK.Hopti-Dys3978.spA, an adeno-associated virus vector containing a mini-dystrophin transgene, showed a dose-dependent increase in mini-dystrophin expression at 6 months post-dose, exceeding wildtype dystrophin levels at high doses. Validation data showed that inter- and intra-assay precision were ≤20% (≤25% at the lower limit of quantification [LLOQ]) and inter- and intra-run relative error was within ±20% (±25% at LLOQ). IA-LC-MS/MS accurately quantifies dystrophin/mini-dystrophin in human and preclinical species with sufficient sensitivity for immediate application in preclinical/clinical trials.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00300-7"

We investigated the pre-clinical development of SMA genetic therapies in rodent models and whether this can predict clinical efficacy. We have performed a systematic review of relevant publications and extracted median survival and details of experimental design. A random effects meta-analysis was used to estimate and compare efficacy. We stratified by experimental design (type of genetic therapy, mouse model, route and time of administration) and sought any evidence of publication bias. 51 publications were identified containing 155 individual comparisons, comprising 2573 animals in total. Genetic therapies prolonged survival in SMA mouse models by 3.23-fold (95% CI 2.75–3.79) compared to controls. Study design characteristics accounted for significant heterogeneity between studies and greatly affected observed median survival ratios. Some evidence of publication bias was found. These data are consistent with the extended average lifespan of Spinraza- and Zolgensma-treated children in the clinic. Together, these results support that SMA has been particularly amenable to genetic therapy approaches and highlight SMA as a trailblazer for therapeutic development.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00292-4"

We investigated the long-term safety and efficacy of AdVEGF-D GT. 30 patients (24 in VEGF-D group and 6 blinded, randomized controls) were followed for 8.2 years (range 6.3–10.4 years). Patients were interviewed for the current severity of symptoms (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class, CCS) and perceived benefit from GT. Medical records were reviewed to assess the incidence of major cardiovascular adverse event (MACE) and other predefined safety endpoints. MACE occurred in 15 patients in VEGF-D group and in five patients in control group (21.5 vs. 24.9 per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio 0.97; 95% confidence interval 0.36–2.63; P = 0.95). Mortality and new-onset comorbidity were similar between the groups. Angina symptoms (CCS) were less severe compared to baseline in VEGF-D group (1.9 vs. 2.9; P = 0.006) but not in control group (2.2 vs. 2.6; P = 0.414). Our study indicates that intramyocardial AdVEGF-D GT is safe in the long-term.

In order to work with an eye larger than mouse, we generated and characterized an Rs1h−/y knockout rat model created by removing exon 3. This rat model expresses no normal RS1 protein. The model shares features of an early onset and more severe phenotype of human XLRS. The morphologic pathology includes schisis cavities at postnatal day 15 (p15), photoreceptors that are misplaced into the subretinal space and OPL, and a reduction of photoreceptor cell numbers by p21. By 6 mo age only 1–3 rows of photoreceptors nuclei remain, and the inner/outer segment layers and the OPL shows major changes. Electroretinogram recordings show functional loss with considerable reduction of both the a-wave and b-wave by p28, indicating early age loss and dysfunction of photoreceptors. The ratio of b-/a-wave amplitudes indicates impaired synaptic transmission to bipolar cells in addition. Supplementing the Rs1h−/y exon3-del retina with normal human RS1 protein using AAV8-RS1 delivery improved the retinal structure. This Rs1h−/y rat model provides a further tool to explore underlying mechanisms of XLRS pathology and to evaluate therapeutic intervention for the XLRS condition.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00290-6"

Since the first trial in 1990, to treat a rare immunodeficiency due to the lack of adenosine deaminase (ADA), clinical exploitation of diverse gene therapeutics all around the globe has clearly shown the immense potential of curing human diseases with genes. However, the path has not always been plain sailing, and tragic events during this 30- year-long journey, even though limited in number, have led to the development of more cautious approaches and thorough regulatory processes prior to clinical approval.

This culminated in 2020 with the Nobel Prize in Chemistry award going to the two researchers that developed a breakthrough method for precise genome editing, the CRISPR-Cas9.

"gt","Development and biological characterization of a clinical gene transfer vector for the treatment of MAK-associated retinitis pigmentosa","By combining next generation whole exome sequencing and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology we found that an Alu repeat inserted in exon 9 of the MAK gene results in a loss of normal MAK transcript and development of human autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Although a relatively rare cause of disease in the general population, the MAK variant is enriched in individuals of Jewish ancestry. In this population, 1 in 55 individuals are carriers and one third of all cases of recessive RP is caused by this gene. The purpose of this study was to determine if a viral gene augmentation strategy could be used to safely restore functional MAK protein as a step toward a treatment for early stage MAK-associated RP. Patient iPSC-derived photoreceptor precursor cells were generated and transduced with viral vectors containing the MAK transcript. One week after transduction, transcript and protein could be detected via rt-PCR and western blotting respectively. Using patient-derived fibroblast cells and mak knockdown zebra fish we demonstrate that over-expression of the retinal MAK transgene restored the cells ability to regulate primary cilia length. In addition, the visual defect in mak knockdown zebrafish was mitigated via treatment with the retinal MAK transgene. There was no evidence of local or systemic toxicity at 1-month or 3-months following subretinal delivery of clinical grade vector into wild type rats. The findings reported here will help pave the way for initiation of a phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of patients with MAK-associated RP.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00291-5"

Despite this success, a massive gap exists between the companies, clinics, and researchers developing these therapeutic approaches, and their availability to the patients who need them. The unacceptable reality is a geographic exclusion of low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) in gene therapy development and ultimately the provision of gene therapies to patients in LMIC. This is particularly relevant for gene therapies to treat human immunodeficiency virus infection and hemoglobinopathies, global health crises impacting tens of millions of people primarily located in LMIC. Bridging this divide will require research, clinical and regulatory infrastructural development, capacity-building, training, an approval pathway and community adoption for success and sustainable affordability. In 2020, the Global Gene Therapy Initiative was formed to tackle the barriers to LMIC inclusion in gene therapy development. This working group includes diverse stakeholders from all sectors and has set a goal of introducing two gene therapy Phase I clinical trials in two LMIC, Uganda and India, by 2024.

"gt","Ultra-sensitive AAV capsid detection by immunocapture-based qPCR following factor VIII gene transfer","Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy vectors are replication-incompetent and thus pose minimal risk for horizontal transmission or release into the environment. In studies with AAV5-FVIII-SQ (valoctocogene roxaparvovec), an investigational gene therapy for hemophilia A, residual vector DNA was detectable in blood, secreta, and excreta, but it remained unclear how long structurally intact AAV5 vector capsids were present. Since a comprehensive assessment of vector shedding is required by regulatory agencies, we developed a new method (termed iqPCR) that utilizes capsid-directed immunocapture followed by qPCR amplification of encapsidated DNA. The limit of detection for AAV5 vector capsids was 1.17E+04 and 2.33E+04 vg/mL in plasma and semen, respectively. Acceptable precision, accuracy, selectivity, and specificity were verified; up to 1.00E+09 vg/mL non-encapsidated vector DNA showed no interference. Anti-AAV5 antibody plasma concentrations above 141 ng/mL decreased AAV5 capsid quantification, suggesting that iqPCR mainly detects free capsids and not those complexed with antibodies. In a clinical study, AAV5-FVIII-SQ capsids were found in plasma and semen but became undetectable within nine weeks after dose administration. Hence, iqPCR monitors the presence and shedding kinetics of intact vector capsids following AAV gene therapy and informs the potential risk for horizontal transmission.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00287-1"

Polymeric vectors offer an attractive alternative to viruses as delivery vectors due to their large packaging capacity and safety profile. In this paper, we have demonstrated the potential use of a highly branched poly(β-amino ester) polymer, HPAE-EB, to enable genomic editing via CRISPRCas9-targeted genomic excision of exon 80 in the COL7A1 gene, through a dual-guide RNA sequence system. The biophysical properties of HPAE-EB were screened in a human embryonic 293 cell line (HEK293), to elucidate optimal conditions for efficient and cytocompatible delivery of a DNA construct encoding Cas9 along with two RNA guides, obtaining 15–20% target genomic excision. When translated to human recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) keratinocytes, transfection efficiency and targeted genomic excision dropped. However, upon delivery of CRISPR–Cas9 as a ribonucleoprotein complex, targeted genomic deletion of exon 80 was increased to over 40%. Our study provides renewed perspective for the further development of polymer delivery systems for application in the gene editing field in general, and specifically for the treatment of RDEB.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00282-6"

This study aimed to describe Qatari experience with onasemnogene abeparvovec by reviewing the clinical outcomes of 9 SMA children (7 SMA type 1 and 2 with SMA type 2) aged 4‒23 months treated between November 2019 and July 2020. Children <2 years with 5q SMA with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene were eligible for gene therapy.

In mice, in vivo lentiviral transduction of alveolar macrophages (AMs) has been described to yield protective pulmonary AAT levels and ameliorate emphysema development. We here investigated the pulmonary transplantation of macrophages (PMT) transgenic for AAT as a potential therapy for AAT deficiency-associated lung pathology. Employing third-generation SIN-lentiviral vectors expressing the human AAT cDNA from the CAG or Cbx-EF1α promoter, we obtained high-level AAT secretion in a murine AM cell line as well as murine bone marrow-derived macrophages differentiated in vitro (AAT MΦ). Secreted AAT demonstrated a physiologic glycosylation pattern as well as elastase-inhibitory and anti-apoptotic properties. AAT MΦ preserved normal morphology, surface phenotype, and functionality. Furthermore, in vitro generated murine AAT MΦ successfully engrafted in AM-deficient Csf2rb–/– mice and converted into a CD11c+/Siglec-F+ AM phenotype as detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and homogenized lung tissue 2 months after PMT. Moreover, human AAT was detected in the lung epithelial lining fluid of transplanted animals. Efficient AAT expression and secretion were also demonstrated for human AAT MΦ, confirming the applicability of our vectors in human cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00269-3"

Truncation of the reading frame in this terminal exon ablates the functionally important C-terminal domain. We hypothesized that targeted excision in ORF15 by CRISPR/Cas9 and the ensuing repair by non-homologous end joining could restore RPGR reading frame in a portion of mutant photoreceptors thereby correcting gene function in vivo. We tested this hypothesis in the rd9 mouse, a naturally occurring mutant line that carries a frameshift mutation in RPGRORF15, through a combination of germline and somatic gene therapy approaches. In germline gene-edited rd9 mice, probing with RPGR domain-specific antibodies demonstrated expression of full length RPGRORF15 protein. Hallmark features of RPGR mutation-associated early disease phenotypes, such as mislocalization of cone opsins, were no longer present. Subretinal injections of the same guide RNA (sgRNA) carried in AAV sgRNA and SpCas9 expression vectors restored reading frame of RPGRORF15 in a subpopulation of cells with broad distribution throughout the retina, confirming successful correction of the mutation. These data suggest that a simplified form of genome editing mediated by CRISPR, as described here, could be further developed to repair RPGRORF15 mutations in vivo.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00258-6"

Therefore, reducing protein aggregation could hold therapeutic potential. We previously identified a novel chaperone protein, serine-rich chaperone protein 1 (SRCP1), that effectively prevents protein aggregation in cell culture and zebrafish models of Huntington’s disease. Here we tested whether this benefit extends to aggregated proteins found in ALS. We used viral-mediated expression of SRCP1 in in vitro and in vivo models of ALS. We found that SRCP1 reduced insoluble SOD1 protein levels in HEK293T cells overexpressing either the A4V or G93R mutant SOD1. However, the reduction of insoluble protein was not observed in either mutant C9orf72 or SOD1 ALS iPSC-derived motor neurons infected with a lentivirus expressing SRCP1. SOD1-G93A ALS mice injected with AAV-SRCP1 showed a small but significant reduction in insoluble and soluble SOD1 in both the brain and spinal cord, but SRCP1 expression did not improve mouse survival. These data indicate that SRCP1 likely reduces insoluble protein burden in a protein and/or context-dependent manner indicating a need for additional insight into SRCP1 function and therapeutic potential.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00276-4"
"gt","Novel tool to quantify with single-cell resolution the number of incoming AAV genomes co-expressed in the mouse nervous system","Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are an established and safe gene delivery tool to target the nervous system. However, the payload capacity of <4.9 kb limits the transfer of large or multiple genes. Oversized payloads could be delivered by fragmenting the transgenes into separate AAV capsids that are then mixed. This strategy could increase the AAV cargo capacity to treat monogenic, polygenic diseases and comorbidities only if controlled co-expression of multiple AAV capsids is achieved on each transduced cell. We developed a tool to quantify the number of incoming AAV genomes that are co-expressed in the nervous system with single-cell resolution. By using an isogenic mix of three AAVs each expressing single fluorescent reporters, we determined that expression of much greater than 31 AAV genomes per neuron in vitro and 20 genomes per neuron in vivo is obtained across different brain regions including anterior cingulate, prefrontal, somatomotor and somatosensory cortex areas, and cerebellar lobule VI. Our results demonstrate that multiple AAV vectors containing different transgenes or transgene fragments, can efficiently co-express in the same neuron. This tool can be used to design and improve AAV-based interrogation of neuronal circuits, map brain connectivity, and treat genetic diseases affecting the nervous system.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00272-8"

The underlying pathophysiology includes a defect in neural crest cells migration, proliferation and differentiation, which are partially explained by identified genetic and epigenetic alterations. Despite the high success rate of the curative surgeries, they are associated with significant adverse outcomes such as enterocolitis, fecal soiling, and chronic constipation. In addition, some patients suffer from extensive lethal variants of the disease, all of which justify the need for an alternative cure.

This review will provide concise background information on HSCR, outline the future approaches of stem cell-based HSCR therapy, review recent key publications, discuss technical and ethical challenges the field faces prior to clinical translation, and tackle such challenges by proposing solutions and evaluating existing approaches to progress further.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00268-4"
"gt","Optimisation of a TALE nuclease targeting the HIV co-receptor CCR5 for clinical application","Disruption of the C-C-Chemokine-receptor-5 (CCR5) gene induces resistance towards CCR5-tropic HIV. Here we optimised our previously described CCR5-Uco-TALEN and its delivery by mRNA electroporation. The novel variant, CCR5-Uco-hetTALEN features an obligatory heterodimeric Fok1-cleavage domain, which resulted in complete abrogation of off-target activity at previously found homodimeric as well as 7/8 in silico predicted, potential heterodimeric off-target sites, the only exception being highly homologous CCR2. Prevailing 18- and 10-bp deletions at the on-target site revealed microhomology-mediated end-joining as a major repair pathway. Notably, the CCR5Δ55–60 protein resulting from the 18-bp deletion was almost completely retained in the cytosol. Simultaneous cutting at CCR5 and CCR2 induced rearrangements, mainly 15-kb deletions between the cut sites, in up to 2% of T cells underlining the necessity to restrict TALEN expression. We optimised in vitro mRNA production and showed that CCR5-on- and CCR2 off-target activities of CCR5-Uco-hetTALEN were limited to the first 72 and 24–48 h post-mRNA electroporation, respectively. Using single-cell HRMCA, we discovered high rates of TALEN-induced biallelic gene editing of CCR5, which translated in large numbers of CCR5-negative cells resistant to HIVenv-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. We conclude that CCR5-Uco-hetTALEN transfected by mRNA electroporation facilitates specific, high-efficiency CCR5 gene-editing (30%–56%) and it is highly suited for clinical translation subject to further characterisation of off-target effects.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00271-9"

"gt","Prime editing – an update on the field","At Gene Therapy, we are continually monitoring the landscape of research, noting those technologies which advance the goal of clinical translation of the field. In one of the most exciting ‘needle-shifting’ gene editing publications published in 2019, David Liu et al., (who pioneered base editing; BE [1]), developed ‘Prime editing (PE) [2]’, erasing several limits of CRISPR that have caused bottlenecks in its therapeutic and biotechnological applicability. Traditional gene editing strategies directing specific changes to the genome sequence itself largely reply on a common step – creating a double-strand break (DSB) to attract and exploit the DNA repair pathway machinery in executing the desired repair. This necessary ‘injury’ to the cell concomitantly contributes to many of the concerns in shifting gene editing to the clinic. This is where BE, and now PE, present technological inflection points on the road to advancing patient treatment. Put another way, say goodbye to DSBs and hello nicks. Thus, with the increased precision potential of PE, we can now accelerate clinical gene editing even further.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00263-9"

Here, we report a lentivirus-based system that helps improve specificity and verification by (a) targeting a selected molecular mechanism, (b) in vivo reporting of expression, and (c) allowing the option to independently silence all regional neural activity. Specifically, we modulate cholinergic signaling of striatal interneurons by shRNAmir and pair it with hM4Di_CFP, a chemogenetic receptor that can function as an in vivo and in situ reporter. Quantitative analyses by visual and deep-learning assisted methods show an inverse linear relation between hM4Di_CFP and ChAT protein expression for several shRNAmir constructs. This approach successfully applies shRNAmir to modulating gene expression in the primate brain and shows that hM4Di_CFP can act as a readout for this modulation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00260-y"

A reflux-free subretinal injection is important to allow effective, safe, and cost-effective gene therapy to the retina. We report on a comparison between manual and robotic assistance in simulated subretinal injections using an artificial retina model. Nine surgeons carried out the procedure with and without the Preceyes Surgical System, using an OPMI Lumera 700 Zeiss surgical microscope equipped with intra-operative optical coherence tomography. Success in creating a bleb without reflux, injection duration, drift, tremor, and increase in the diameter of the puncture hole were analyzed. Robotic assistance improved drift (median 16 vs 212 µm), tremor (median 1 vs 18 µm), enlargement of the retinal hole, and allowed for prolonged injection times (median 52 vs 29 sec). Robotic assistance allowed higher rate of bleb formation (8/9 vs 4/9 attempts) with a moderate reduction in reflux (7/9 vs 8/9 attempts) in this artificial model. Robotic assistance can significantly contribute to subretinal injections and provide quantifiable parameters in assessing surgical and clinical success of novel retinal gene therapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00262-w"

One of those strategies is directed at the protection of CD4+-T helper cells from HIV infection in HIV-positive individuals. To this end, we have developed and optimised a CCR5-targeting TALE nuclease, CCR5-Uco-hetTALEN, mediating high-efficiency knockout of C-C motif chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), the HIV co-receptor essential during initial infection. Clinical translation of the knockout approach requires up-scaling of the manufacturing process to clinically relevant cell numbers in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP). Here we present a GMP-compatible mRNA electroporation protocol for the automated production of CCR5-edited CD4+-T cells in the closed CliniMACS Prodigy system. The automated process reliably produced high amounts of CCR5-edited CD4+-T cells (>1.5 × 109 cells with >60% CCR5 editing) within 12 days. Of note, about 40% of total large-scale produced cells showed a biallelic CCR5 editing, and between 25 and 42% of produced cells had a central memory T-cell phenotype. In conclusion, transfection of primary T cells with CCR5-Uco-hetTALEN mRNA is readily scalable for GMP-compatible production and hence suitable for application in HIV gene therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00259-5"

A key ambition of the CARAMBA project is to provide clinical proof-of-concept for virus-free CAR gene transfer using advanced Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon technology. SB transposition in CAR-T engineering is attractive due to the high rate of stable CAR gene transfer enabled by optimized hyperactive SB100X transposase and transposon combinations, encoded by mRNA and minicircle DNA, respectively, as preferred vector embodiments. This approach bears the potential to facilitate and expedite vector procurement, CAR-T manufacturing and distribution, and the promise to provide a safe, effective, and economically sustainable treatment. As an exemplary and novel target for SB-based CAR-T cells, the CARAMBA consortium has selected the SLAMF7 antigen in multiple myeloma. SLAMF7 CAR-T cells confer potent and consistent anti-myeloma activity in preclinical assays in vitro and in vivo. The CARAMBA clinical trial (Phase-I/IIA; EudraCT: 2019-001264-30) investigates the feasibility, safety, and anti-myeloma efficacy of autologous SLAMF7 CAR-T cells.

"gt","Enhanced CNS transduction from AAV.PHP.eB infusion into the cisterna magna of older adult rats compared to AAV9","The development of high efficiency, central nervous system (CNS) targeting AAV-based gene therapies is necessary to address challenges in both pre-clinical and clinical investigations. The engineered capsids, AAV.PHP.B and AAV.PHP.eB, show vastly improved blood-brain barrier penetration compared to their parent serotype, AAV9, but with variable effect depending on animal system, strain, and delivery route. As most characterizations of AAV.PHP variants have been performed in mice, it is currently unknown whether AAV.PHP variants improve CNS targeting when delivered intrathecally in rats. We evaluated the comparative transduction efficiencies of equititer doses (6 × 1011vg) of AAV.PHP.eB-CAG-GFP and AAV9-CAG-GFP when delivered into the cisterna magna of 6–9-month old rats. Using both quantitative and qualitative assessments, we observed consistently superior biodistribution of GFP+ cells and fibers in animals treated with AAV.PHP.eB compared to those treated with AAV9. Enhanced GFP signal was uniformly observed throughout rostrocaudal brain regions in AAV.PHP.eB-treated animals with matching GFP protein expression detected in the forebrain, midbrain, and cerebellum. Collectively, these data illustrate the benefit of intracisternal infusions of AAV.PHP.eB as an optimal system to distribute CNS gene therapies in preclinical investigations of rats, and may have important translational implications for the clinical CNS targeting.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00244-y"

Lately, CAR-NK cell therapies have also come into focus as novel therapeutic options to address hurdles related to CAR-T cell therapies, such as therapy-induced side effects. Currently, more than 500 CAR-T and 17 CAR-NK cell trials are being conducted worldwide including the four CAR-T cell products Kymriah, Yescarta, Tecartus and Breyanzi, which are already available on the market. Most CAR-T cell-based gene therapy products that are under clinical evaluation consist of autologous enriched T cells, whereas CAR-NK cell-based approaches can be generated from allogeneic donors. Besides modification based on a second-generation CAR, more advanced CAR-immune cell therapeutics are being tested, which utilize precise insertion of genes to circumvent graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or employ a dual targeting approach and adapter CARs in order to avoid therapy resistance caused by antigen loss.

The bus journey from the airport took me along tree-lined streets where the spring green of the new leaves was so bright and so crisp that I was sure my jet lagged brain must have mistakenly processed their natural hue for something surreal. The Ontario lake was in my peripheral vision the entire time, and it was so vast my mind kept defaulting to the thought of it as an ocean. The bus driver shouted out that my stop was next so I got off, looked around and was struck by the smell of humid wet air tinged with the intoxicating scent of freshly cut grass. And then I could not breathe. And my heart started beating so fast in my chest that I was sure it was going to give a final manic squeeze and that I would die right there on a pavement halfway across the world from my loved ones and my life.I was in Toronto to give a talk at one of the biggest HIV conferences held every 2 years, and the city was awash with delegates, sponsors, and activists. I was a Ph.D. graduate at the time and wrapped up deeply in the world of how HIV manipulates the ancient and innate RNA interference pathway in human cells in order to create an optimal environment for itself. My advisor secured funding that allowed me to fly from the southern tip of Africa across the planet to mingle with a slice of the HIV community and broaden my network in an effort to open up my options for doing a postdoc somewhere in the developed world. Hard work had gotten me here. But so too had the immense fortune of simply being born into a middle class white family in South Africa. And an incredible amount of good luck. I had received several bursaries over the years that had eased the fiscal pressure of putting me through tertiary education in a country where a significant number of people face daily difficulties in affording basic resources. Coupled with my deep curiosity for figuring out how pathogens make us ill, the HIV burden in our country presented a clear path for my career as a scientist, although I was still unsure what my next step would be.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00242-0"

We developed a gene therapy approach for CMT1X using an AAV9 vector to deliver the GJB1/Cx32 gene under the myelin protein zero (Mpz) promoter for targeted expression in Schwann cells. Lumbar intrathecal injection of the AAV9-Mpz.GJB1 resulted in widespread biodistribution in the peripheral nervous system including lumbar roots, sciatic and femoral nerves, as well as in Cx32 expression in the paranodal non-compact myelin areas of myelinated fibers. A pre-, as well as post-onset treatment trial in Gjb1-null mice, demonstrated improved motor performance and sciatic nerve conduction velocities along with improved myelination and reduced inflammation in peripheral nerve tissues. Blood biomarker levels were also significantly ameliorated in treated mice.

Dysregulation of the complement system is thought to play an important role in disease pathology and supplementation of Complement Factor I (CFI), a key regulator of the complement system, has the potential to provide a treatment option for AMD. In this study, we demonstrate the generation of AAV constructs carrying the human CFI sequence and expression of CFI in cell lines and in the retina of C57BL/6 J mice. Four codon optimised constructs were compared to the most common human CFI sequence. All constructs expressed CFI protein; however, most codon optimised sequences resulted in significantly reduced CFI secretion compared to the non-optimised CFI sequence. In vivo expression analysis showed that CFI was predominantly expressed in the RPE and photoreceptors. Secreted protein in vitreous humour was demonstrated to be functionally active. The findings presented here have led to the formulation of an AAV-vectored gene therapy product currently being tested in a first-in-human clinical trial in subjects with geographic atrophy secondary to dry AMD (NCT03846193).","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00239-9"
"gt","Alternative oxidase encoded by sequence-optimized and chemically-modified RNA transfected into mammalian cells is catalytically active","Plants and other organisms, but not insects or vertebrates, express the auxiliary respiratory enzyme alternative oxidase (AOX) that bypasses mitochondrial respiratory complexes III and/or IV when impaired. Persistent expression of AOX from Ciona intestinalis in mammalian models has previously been shown to be effective in alleviating some metabolic stresses produced by respiratory chain inhibition while exacerbating others. This implies that chronic AOX expression may modify or disrupt metabolic signaling processes necessary to orchestrate adaptive remodeling, suggesting that its potential therapeutic use may be confined to acute pathologies, where a single course of treatment would suffice. One possible route for administering AOX transiently is AOX-encoding nucleic acid constructs. Here we demonstrate that AOX-encoding chemically-modified RNA (cmRNA), sequence-optimized for expression in mammalian cells, was able to support AOX expression in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts (iMEFs), human lung carcinoma cells (A549) and primary mouse pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). AOX protein was detectable as early as 3 h after transfection, had a half-life of ~4 days and was catalytically active, thus supporting respiration and protecting against respiratory inhibition. Our data demonstrate that AOX-encoding cmRNA optimized for use in mammalian cells represents a viable route to investigate and possibly treat mitochondrial respiratory disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00235-z"
"gt","Use of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of CNS cell type genes to profile transduction of AAV by neonatal intracerebroventricular delivery in mice","Adeno-associated virus (AAV) transduction efficiency and tropism are conventionally determined by high expression of a fluorescent reporter gene. Emerging data has suggested that such conventional methods may underestimate AAV transduction for cells in which reporter expression from AAV vectors is undetectable. To explore an alternative method that captures AAV transduction in cells in which low expression of a cargo is sufficient for the intended activity, we sought after CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption. In this study, we use AAV to deliver CRISPR/guide RNA designed to abolish the genes NeuN, GFAP, or MOG expressed specifically in neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes respectively in the central nervous system (CNS) of mice. Abrogated expression of these cell-type-specific genes can be measured biochemically in CNS subregions and provides quantitative assessment of AAV transduction in these CNS cell types. By using this method, we compared CNS transduction of AAV9, AAV-PHP.B, and AAV-PHP.eB delivered via intracerebroventricular injection (ICV) in neonatal mice. We found both AAV-PHP.B and AAV-PHP.eB resulted in marked disruption of the NeuN gene by CRISPR/Cas9, significantly greater than AAV9 in several brain regions and spinal cord. In contrast, only modest disruption of the GFAP gene and the MOG gene was observed by all three AAV variants. Since the procedure of ICV circumvents the blood–brain barrier, our data suggests that, independent of their ability to cross the blood–brain barrier, AAV-PHP.B variants also exhibit remarkably improved neuronal transduction in the CNS. We anticipate this approach will facilitate profiling of AAV cellular tropism in murine CNS.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00223-3"

Yet, allogeneic HSCT bear considerable risks for the patient such as non-engraftment, or graft-versus host disease. Transplanting gene modified autologous HSCs is a promising approach not only for inherited blood/immune cell diseases, but also for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. However, there is emerging evidence for substantial heterogeneity of HSCs in situ as well as ex vivo that is also observed after HSCT. Thus, HSC gene modification concepts are suggested to consider that different blood disorders affect specific hematopoietic cell types. We will discuss the relevance of HSC heterogeneity for the development and manufacture of gene therapies and in exemplary diseases with a specific emphasis on the key target HSC types myeloid-biased, lymphoid-biased, and balanced HSCs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00229-x"

The exact mechanism of loss is not known, prior evidence suggests this is through oxidative stress to either neighboring cells or RGC specifically. We investigated the neuroprotective potential of RGC-selective SIRT1 gene therapy in the optic nerve crush (ONC) model. We hypothesized that AAV-mediated overexpression of SIRT1 in RGCs reduces RGC loss, thereby preserving visual function. Cohorts of C57Bl/6J mice received intravitreal injection of experimental or control AAVs using either a ganglion cell promoter or a constitutive promoter and ONC was performed. Visual function was examined by optokinetic response (OKR) for 7 days following ONC. Retina and optic nerves were harvested to investigate RGC survival by immunolabeling. The AAV7m8-SNCG.SIRT1 vector showed 44% transduction efficiency for RGCs compared with 25% (P > 0.05) by AAV2-CAG.SIRT1, and AAV7m8-SNCG.SIRT1 drives expression selectively in RGCs in vivo. Animals modeling ONC demonstrated reduced visual acuity compared to controls. Intravitreal delivery of AAV7m8-SNCG.SIRT1 mediated significant preservation of the OKR and RGC survival compared to AAV7m8-SNCG.eGFP controls, an effect not seen with the AAV2 vector. RGC-selective expression of SIRT1 offers a targeted therapy for an animal model with significant ganglion cell loss. Over-expression of SIRT1 through AAV-mediated gene transduction suggests a RGC selective component of neuro-protection using the ONC model. This study expands our understanding of SIRT1 mediated neuroprotection in the context of compressive or traumatic optic neuropathy, making it a strong therapeutic candidate for testing in all optic neuropathies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00219-z"
"gt","Gene delivery to the hypoglossal motor system: preclinical studies and translational potential","Dysfunction and/or reduced activity in the tongue muscles contributes to conditions such as dysphagia, dysarthria, and sleep disordered breathing. Current treatments are often inadequate, and the tongue is a readily accessible target for therapeutic gene delivery. In this regard, gene therapy specifically targeting the tongue motor system offers two general strategies for treating lingual disorders. First, correcting tongue myofiber and/or hypoglossal (XII) motoneuron pathology in genetic neuromuscular disorders may be readily achieved by intralingual delivery of viral vectors. The retrograde movement of viral vectors such as adeno-associated virus (AAV) enables targeted distribution to XII motoneurons via intralingual viral delivery. Second, conditions with impaired or reduced tongue muscle activation can potentially be treated using viral-driven chemo- or optogenetic approaches to activate or inhibit XII motoneurons and/or tongue myofibers. Further considerations that are highly relevant to lingual gene therapy include (1) the diversity of the motoneurons which control the tongue, (2) the patterns of XII nerve branching, and (3) the complexity of tongue muscle anatomy and biomechanics. Preclinical studies show considerable promise for lingual directed gene therapy in neuromuscular disease, but the potential of such approaches is largely untapped.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00225-1"

On the one hand, neutralizing antibodies and cytotoxic T cells can have a dramatic impact on the efficacy and safety of human gene therapies. On the other hand, regulatory T cells (Treg) can promote tolerance toward transgenes thereby enabling long-term benefits of in vivo gene therapy after a single administration. Pre-existing antibodies and T cell immunity has been a major obstacle for in vivo gene therapies with viral vectors. As CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing advances toward the clinics, the technology’s inherent immunogenicity must be addressed in order to guide clinical treatment decisions. This review summarizes the recent evidence on Cas9-specific immunity in humans—including early results from clinical trials—and discusses the risks for in vivo gene therapies. Finally, we focus on solutions and highlight the potential role of Cas9-specific Treg cells to promote immune tolerance. As a “beneficial alliance” beyond Cas9-immunity, antigen-specific Treg cells may serve as a living and targeted immunosuppressant to increase safety and efficacy of gene therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00232-2"

"gt","Highly efficient neuronal gene knockout in vivo by CRISPR-Cas9 via neonatal intracerebroventricular injection of AAV in mice","CRISPR-Cas systems have emerged as a powerful tool to generate genetic models for studying normal and diseased central nervous system (CNS). Targeted gene disruption at specific loci has been demonstrated successfully in non-dividing neurons. Despite its simplicity, high specificity and low cost, the efficiency of CRISPR-mediated knockout in vivo can be substantially impacted by many parameters. Here, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to disrupt the neuronal-specific gene, NeuN, and optimized key parameters to achieve effective gene knockout broadly in the CNS in postnatal mice. Three cell lines and two primary neuron cultures were used to validate the disruption of NeuN by single-guide RNAs (sgRNA) harboring distinct spacers and scaffold sequences. This triage identified an optimal sgRNA design with the highest NeuN disruption in in vitro and in vivo systems. To enhance CRISPR efficiency, AAV-PHP.B, a vector with superior neuronal transduction, was used to deliver this sgRNA in Cas9 mice via neonatal intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection. This approach resulted in 99.4% biallelic indels rate in the transduced cells, leading to greater than 70% reduction of total NeuN proteins in the cortex, hippocampus and spinal cord. This work contributes to the optimization of CRISPR-mediated knockout and will be beneficial for fundamental and preclinical research.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00224-2"

Now, almost 140 years later, MΦ are known as incredible cell types with unique functions and capabilities. In fact, Ilya Metchnikoff paved our understanding of peripheral blood monocytes and MΦ in the clearance of pathogens, while follow-up studies described MΦ in various organs in which their defined functions are directly linked to a divergent onset (Fig. 1).MΦ are found in all organs, typically forming a three-dimensional network that supports tissue function by production of growth factors and phagocytosis of dead and dying cells during steady state. Moreover, MΦ are among the first cells encountering pathogens, debris, or tumor cells in diseased tissue. Given these and other multifarious functions and their important role in the onset and/or progression of various diseases, MΦ are therefore rendered as a perfect candidate in cell-based immunotherapies.Against a great body of newly emerging data, scientists still encounter in the MΦ research literature the terminology of MΦ polarization, most commonly into the M1 (classically activated) and M2 (alternatively activated) phenotypes (see also review [2]). Thus, also therapy approaches aim at using this apparent plasticity of MΦ and “simply” try to switch them from M1 to M2 or the other way around, depending on whether anti- or pro-inflammatory responses are required. However, these M1/M2 definitions stem from cells treated with interferon-γ or interleukin-4, respectively, and ignore the fact that these defined and isolated stimuli in vitro do not emerge in vivo. In contrast, under physiological conditions a plethora of stimuli (e.g., cytokines, bacteria, foreign antigens, or the tissue niche) modulate MΦ function in an orchestrated fashion, which can be difficult to recapitulate in vitro [2].","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00221-5"

The outcome measures included functional, electrophysiological and histological assessments. At 9-months of age, NT-3 treated mice showed no functional decline with normalized compound muscle action potential amplitudes. Myelin thickness and nerve conduction velocity significantly improved compared with untreated cohort.

"gt","Genome editing for Duchenne muscular dystrophy: a glimpse of the future?","Mutations in Dystrophin, one of the largest proteins in the mammalian body, are causative for a severe form of muscle disease, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), affecting not only skeletal muscle, but also the heart. In particular, exons 45–52 constitute a hotspot for DMD mutations. A variety of molecular therapies have been developed, comprising vectors encoding micro- and minidystrophins as well as utrophin, a protein with partially overlapping functions. With the advent of the CRISPR-Cas9-nuclease, genome editing offers a novel option of correction of the disease-cuasing mutations. Full restoration of the healthy gene by homology directed repair is a rare event. However, non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) may restore the reading frame by causing exon excision. This approach has first been demonstrated in mice and then translated to large animals (dogs, pigs). This review discusses the potential opportunities and limitations of genome editing in DMD, including the generation of appropriate animal models as well as new developments in genome editing tools.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00222-4"
"gt","Human MiniPromoters for ocular-rAAV expression in ON bipolar, cone, corneal, endothelial, Müller glial, and PAX6 cells","Small and cell-type restricted promoters are important tools for basic and preclinical research, and clinical delivery of gene therapies. In clinical gene therapy, ophthalmic trials have been leading the field, with over 50% of ocular clinical trials using promoters that restrict expression based on cell type. Here, 19 human DNA MiniPromoters were bioinformatically designed for rAAV, tested by neonatal intravenous delivery in mouse, and successful MiniPromoters went on to be tested by intravitreal, subretinal, intrastromal, and/or intravenous delivery in adult mouse. We present promoter development as an overview for each cell type, but only show results in detail for the recommended MiniPromoters: Ple265 and Ple341 (PCP2) ON bipolar, Ple349 (PDE6H) cone, Ple253 (PITX3) corneal stroma, Ple32 (CLDN5) endothelial cells of the blood–retina barrier, Ple316 (NR2E1) Müller glia, and Ple331 (PAX6) PAX6 positive. Overall, we present a resource of new, redesigned, and improved MiniPromoters for ocular gene therapy that range in size from 784 to 2484 bp, and from weaker, equal, or stronger in strength relative to the ubiquitous control promoter smCBA. All MiniPromoters will be useful for therapies involving small regulatory RNA and DNA, and proteins ranging from 517 to 1084 amino acids, representing 62.9–90.2% of human proteins.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00227-z"
"gt","Single-cell mapping of focused ultrasound-transfected brain","Gene delivery via focused ultrasound (FUS) mediated blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening is a disruptive therapeutic modality. Unlocking its full potential will require an understanding of how FUS parameters (e.g., peak-negative pressure (PNP)) affect transfected cell populations. Following plasmid (mRuby) delivery across the BBB with 1 MHz FUS, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing to ascertain that distributions of transfected cell types were highly dependent on PNP. Cells of the BBB (i.e., endothelial cells, pericytes, and astrocytes) were enriched at 0.2 MPa PNP, while transfection of cells distal to the BBB (i.e., neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia) was augmented at 0.4 MPa PNP. PNP-dependent differential gene expression was observed for multiple cell types. Cell stress genes were upregulated proportional to PNP, independent of cell type. Our results underscore how FUS may be tuned to bias transfection toward specific brain cell types in vivo and predict how those cells will respond to transfection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00226-0"
"gt","Targeted multi-epitope switching enables straightforward positive/negative selection of CAR T cells","Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell technology has enabled successfully novel concepts to treat cancer patients, with substantial remission rates in lymphoid malignancies. This cell therapy is based on autologous T lymphocytes that are genetically modified to express a CAR that recognizes tumor-associated antigens and mediates the elimination of the respective tumor cells. Current limitations include laborious manufacturing procedures as well as severe immunological side effects upon administration of CAR T cells. To address these limitations, we integrated RQR8, a multi-epitope molecule harboring a CD34 epitope and two CD20 mimotopes, alongside a CD19-targeting CAR, into the CD52 locus. Using CRISPR-Cas9 and adeno-associated virus-based donor vectors, some 60% of genome-edited T cells were CAR+/CD20+/CD34+/CD52− without further selection. This could be increased to >95% purity after CD34 tag-based positive selection. These epitope-switched CAR T cells retained cell killing competence against CD19+ tumor cells, and were resistant to alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) but sensitive to rituximab (anti-CD20) in complement-dependent cytotoxicity assays. In conclusion, gene editing-based multiple epitope switching represents a promising development with the potential to improve both the manufacturing procedure as well as the clinical safety of CAR T cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-021-00220-6"
"gt","Development of a dual hybrid AAV vector for endothelial-targeted expression of von Willebrand factor","Von Willebrand disease (VWD), the most common inherited bleeding disorder in humans, is caused by quantitative or qualitative defects in von Willebrand factor (VWF). VWD represents a potential target for gene therapy applications, as a single treatment could potentially result in a long-term correction of the disease. In recent years, several liver-directed gene therapy approaches have been exploited for VWD, but their efficacy was generally limited by the large size of the VWF transgene and the reduced hemostatic activity of the protein produced from hepatocytes. In this context, we aimed at developing a gene therapy strategy for gene delivery into endothelial cells, the natural site of biosynthesis of VWF. We optimized an endothelial-specific dual hybrid AAV vector, in which the large VWF cDNA was put under the control of an endothelial promoter and correctly reconstituted upon cell transduction by a combination of trans-splicing and homologous recombination mechanisms. In addition, we modified the AAV vector capsid by introducing an endothelial-targeting peptide to improve the efficiency for endothelial-directed gene transfer. This vector platform allowed the reconstitution of full-length VWF transgene both in vitro in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and in vivo in VWD mice, resulting in long-term expression of VWF.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-00218-6"
"gt","Validation of an IFN-gamma ELISpot assay to measure cellular immune responses against viral antigens in non-human primates","Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV)-based gene therapy vectors are in development for many inherited human disorders. In nonclinical studies, cellular immune responses mediated by cytotoxic T cells may target vector-transduced cells, which could impact safety and efficacy. Here, we describe the bioanalytical validation of an interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)-based Enzyme-Linked Immunospot (ELISpot) assay for measuring T cell responses against viral antigens in cynomolgus monkeys. Since ELISpots performed with antigen-derived peptides offer a universal assay format, method performance characteristics were validated using widely available peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) responsive to cytomegalovirus peptides. The limit of detection and confirmatory cut point were established using statistical methods; precision, specificity, and linearity were confirmed. Monkey PBMCs from an AAV5 gene therapy study were then analyzed, using peptide pools spanning the vector capsid and transgene product. AAV5-specific T cell responses were detected only in 2 of 18 monkeys at Day 28, but not at Day 13 and 56 after vector administration, with no correlation to liver enzyme elevations or transgene expression levels. No transgene product-specific T cell responses occurred. In conclusion, while viral peptide-specific IFN-γ ELISpots can be successfully validated for monkey PBMCs, monitoring peripheral T cell responses in non-clinical AAV5 gene therapy studies was of limited value to interpret safety or efficacy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-00214-w"
"gt","Double viral vector technology for selective manipulation of neural pathways with higher level of efficiency and safety","Pathway-selective gene delivery would be critical for future gene therapy against neuropsychiatric disorders, traumatic neuronal injuries, or neurodegenerative diseases, because the impaired functions depend on neural circuits affected by the insults. Pathway-selective gene delivery can be achieved by double viral vector techniques, which combine an injection of a retrograde transport viral vector into the projection area of the target neurons and that of an anterograde viral vector into their somas. In this study, we tested the efficiency of gene delivery with different combinations of viral vectors to the pathway extending from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) to the cortical motor regions in rats, considered to be critical in the promotion of motor recovery from neural injuries. It was found that retrograde recombinant adeno-associated virus 2-retro (rAAV2reto) combined with anterograde AAVDJ (type2/type4/type5/type8/type9/avian/bovine/caprine chimera) exhibited the highest transduction efficiency in the short term (3–6 weeks) but high toxicity in the long term (3 months). In contrast, the same rAAV2reto combined with anterograde AAV5 displayed moderate transduction efficiency in the short term but low toxicity in the long term. These data suggest that the combination of anterograde AAV5 and retrograde rAAV2retro is suitable for safe and efficient gene delivery to the VTA-cortical pathway.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-00212-y"
"gt","Site-specific modifications to AAV8 capsid yields enhanced brain transduction in the neonatal MPS IIIB mouse","Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB (MPS IIIB) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal disease caused by defective production of the enzyme α-N-acetylglucosaminidase. It is characterized by severe and complex central nervous system degeneration. Effective therapies will likely target early onset disease and overcome the blood–brain barrier. Modifications of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector capsids that enhance transduction efficiency have been described in the retina. Herein, we describe for the first time, a transduction assessment of two intracranially administered adeno-associated virus serotype 8 variants, in which specific surface-exposed tyrosine (Y) and threonine (T) residues were substituted with phenylalanine (F) and valine (V) residues, respectively. A double-mutant (Y444 + 733F) and a triple-mutant (Y444 + 733F + T494V) AAV8 were evaluated for their efficacy for the potential treatment of MPS IIIB in a neonatal setting. We evaluated biodistribution and transduction profiles of both variants compared to the unmodified parental AAV8, and assessed whether the method of vector administration would modulate their utility. Vectors were administered through four intracranial routes: six sites (IC6), thalamic (T), intracerebroventricular, and ventral tegmental area into neonatal mice. Overall, we conclude that the IC6 method resulted in the widest biodistribution within the brain. Noteworthy, we demonstrate that GFP intensity was significantly more robust with AAV8 (double Y–F + T–V) compared to AAV8 (double Y–F). This provides proof of concept for the enhanced utility of IC6 administration of the capsid modified AAV8 (double Y–F + T–V) as a valid therapeutic approach for the treatment of MPS IIIB, with further implications for other monogenic diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-00206-w"
"gt","The stability of envelope-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors","Lentiviral vectors have become popular tools for stable genetic modification of mammalian cells. In some applications of lentiviral vector-transduced cells, infectious-lentiviral particles should be absent. Quantification of the free-vector particles that remain from the inoculum can be difficult. Therefore a formula was established that yields an estimation of the ‘Reduction Ratio.’ This ratio represents the loss of titer based on a number of vector-inactivating effects. In this study, we evaluated several parameters and assumptions that were used in the current formula. We generated new data on the stability and trypsin sensitivity of lentiviral vectors pseudotyped with eight heterologous envelope proteins and the loss of vectors by washing or passaging the cell cultures. Our data demonstrate that the loss of virus titer under the influence of trypsin as well as the half-life of the particles in tissue culture medium is dependent on the vector’s envelope protein. While VSV-G-envelope-pseudotyped particles were unsensitive to trypsin, the titer of vectors pseudotyped with other envelope proteins decreased 2–110-fold. The half-life in culture medium ranged from 8 to 40 h for the different envelope-pseudotyped vectors, with 35 h for VSV-G-envelope-pseudotyped vector particles. Additionally, we found that removal of the culture medium from Ø35 mm to Ø10 cm dishes reduces the amount of vector particles in the culture by 50-fold and 20-fold, respectively. Together these data can be used to more precisely estimate the maximum number of free lentiviral vector particles in cell cultures.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-00193-y"

We are only beginning to identify the molecular variables that influence the specificity and the efficiency of CRISPR- directed gene editing, including the position of the cleavage site and the inherent variability among patient samples selected for CRISPR-directed gene editing. Here, we target the beta globin gene in human CD34+ cells to assess the impact of these two variables and find that both contribute to the global diversity of genetic outcomes. Our study demonstrates a unique genetic profile of indels that is generated based on where along the beta globin gene attempts are made to correct the SCD single base mutation. Interestingly, even within the same patient sample, the location of where along the beta globin gene the DNA is cut, HDR activity varies widely. Our data establish a framework upon which realistic protocols inform strategies for gene editing for SCD overcoming the practical hurdles that often impede clinical success.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-00192-z"

The SERCA-LVAD trial was one of a program of AAV1/SERCA2a cardiac gene therapy trials including CUPID1, CUPID 2 and AGENT trials. Enroled subjects were randomised to receive a single intracoronary infusion of 1 × 1013 DNase-resistant AAV1/SERCA2a particles or a placebo solution in a double-blinded design, stratified by presence of neutralising antibodies to AAV. Elective endomyocardial biopsy was performed at 6 months unless the subject had undergone cardiac transplantation, with myocardial samples assessed for the presence of exogenous viral DNA from the treatment vector. Safety assessments including ELISPOT were serially performed. Although designed as a 24 subject trial, recruitment was stopped after five subjects had been randomised and received infusion due to the neutral result from the CUPID 2 trial. Here we describe the results from the 5 patients at 3 years follow up, which confirmed that viral DNA was delivered to the failing human heart in 2 patients receiving gene therapy with vector detectable at follow up endomyocardial biopsy or cardiac transplantation. Absolute levels of detectable transgene DNA were low, and no functional benefit was observed. There were no safety concerns in this small cohort. This trial identified some of the challenges of performing gene therapy trials in this LVAD patient cohort which may help guide future trial design.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-0171-7"

"gt","Maximizing lentiviral vector gene transfer in the CNS","Gene transfer is a widely developed technique for studying and treating genetic diseases. However, the development of therapeutic strategies is challenging, due to the cellular and functional complexity of the central nervous system (CNS), its large size and restricted access. We explored two parameters for improving gene transfer efficacy and capacity for the selective targeting of subpopulations of cells with lentiviral vectors (LVs). We first developed a second-generation LV specifically targeting astrocytes for the efficient expression or silencing of genes of interest, and to better study the importance of cell subpopulations in neurological disorders. We then made use of the retrograde transport properties of a chimeric envelope to target brain circuits affected in CNS diseases and achieve a broad distribution. The combination of retrograde transport and specific tropism displayed by this LV provides opportunities for delivering therapeutic genes to specific cell populations and ensuring high levels of transduction in interconnected brain areas following local administration. This new LV and delivery strategy should be of greater therapeutic benefit and opens up new possibilities for the preclinical development of gene therapy for neurodegenerative diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-0172-6"
"gt","Optimization of adeno-associated viral vector-mediated transduction of the corticospinal tract: comparison of four promoters","Adeno-associated viral vectors are widely used as vehicles for gene transfer to the nervous system. The promoter and viral vector serotype are two key factors that determine the expression dynamics of the transgene. A previous comparative study has demonstrated that AAV1 displays efficient transduction of layer V corticospinal neurons, but the optimal promoter for transgene expression in corticospinal neurons has not been determined yet. In this paper, we report a side-by-side comparison between four commonly used promoters: the short CMV early enhancer/chicken β actin (sCAG), human cytomegalovirus (hCMV), mouse phosphoglycerate kinase (mPGK) and human synapsin (hSYN) promoter. Reporter constructs with each of these promoters were packaged in AAV1, and were injected in the sensorimotor cortex of rats and mice in order to transduce the corticospinal tract. Transgene expression levels and the cellular transduction profile were examined after 6 weeks. The AAV1 vectors harbouring the hCMV and sCAG promoters resulted in transgene expression in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The mPGK and hSYN promoters directed the strongest transgene expression. The mPGK promoter did drive expression in cortical neurons and oligodendrocytes, while transduction with AAV harbouring the hSYN promoter resulted in neuron-specific expression, including perineuronal net expressing interneurons and layer V corticospinal neurons. This promoter comparison study contributes to improve transgene delivery into the brain and spinal cord. The optimized transduction of the corticospinal tract will be beneficial for spinal cord injury research.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-0169-1"

It is caused by defects of the phagocytic NADPH oxidase, a multicomponent enzyme system responsible for effective pathogen killing. A phase I/II clinical trial of lentiviral gene therapy is underway for the most common form of CGD, X-linked, caused by mutations in the gp91phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase. We propose to use a similar strategy to tackle p47phox-deficient CGD, caused by mutations in NCF1, which encodes the p47phox cytosolic component of the enzymatic complex. We generated a pCCLCHIM-p47phox lentiviral vector, containing the chimeric Cathepsin G/FES myeloid promoter and a codon-optimised version of the human NCF1 cDNA. Here we show that transduction with the pCCLCHIM-p47phox vector efficiently restores p47phox expression and biochemical NADPH oxidase function in p47phox-deficient human and murine cells. We also tested the ability of our gene therapy approach to control infection by challenging p47phox-null mice with Salmonella Typhimurium, a leading cause of sepsis in CGD patients, and found that mice reconstituted with lentivirus-transduced hematopoietic stem cells had a reduced bacterial load compared with untreated mice. Overall, our results potentially support the clinical development of a gene therapy approach using the pCCLCHIM-p47phox vector.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-0164-6"

First, we investigate the susceptibility of cancer cells to NDV infection, HepG2, MDA-MB-231, and SH-SY5Y cells were susceptible, A549, MCF7, and LoVo cells were less susceptible. To investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for cancer cell susceptibility, transcriptome sequencing was carried out. We found that the levels of alpha-sialic acid acyltransferase were upregulated in MDA-MB-231 cells compared with MCF7 cells, and the interferon was downregulated. Second, to optimize the oncolytic capacity of the wild-type rClone30, a series of chimeric viruses rClone30-Anh(HN), rClone30-Anh(F), and rClone30-Anh(HN-F) were constructed by exchanging the HN gene, F gene or both of non-lytic rClone30 strain with lytic strain Anhinga. rClone30-Anh(F) and rClone30-Anh(HN-F) enhanced the oncolytic effect of the rClone30, and this enhancement is more obvious in the susceptible cells. The oncolytic mechanism of rClone30-Anh(F) was analyzed by transcriptome analyses, in comparison with rClone30, rClone30-Anh(F) upregulated the expression of ATG5, Beclin 1, and MAP1LC3B, thus activating autophagy and promoting the production of syncytia. In conclusion, our study provides a strategy to enhance the oncolytic effect of rClone30.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-0145-9"

In this study, we reported the use of natural polyphenol to facilitate the condensation of single-strand oligonucleotides by cationic polymers. Green tea catechin complexed with single-strand oligonucleotides to form anionic nanoparticles, which were further coated by low molecular weight cationic polymers to increase their cell internalization. The resulting core-shell structured nanoparticles, so-called green nanoparticles (GNPs), showed improved cargo stability, and achieved high efficiency in the delivery of several types of single-strand oligonucleotides including antisense oligonucleotides, anti-miRNA, and DNAzyme.

Here, we investigated the effects of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated cardiac wild-type desmin expression in homozygous desmin knockout (DKO) and homozygous R349P desmin knockin (DKI) mice. These mice serve as disease models for two subforms of autosomal-recessive desminopathies, the former for the one with a complete lack of desmin protein and the latter for the one with solely mutant desmin protein expression in conjunction with protein aggregation pathology in striated muscle. Two-month-old mice were injected with either a single dose of 5 × 1012 AAV9-hTNT2-mDes (AAV-Des) vector genomes or NaCl as control. One week after injection, mice were subjected to a forced swimming exercise protocol for 4 weeks. Cardiac function was monitored over a period of 15 month after injection and before the mice were sacrificed for biochemical and morphological analysis. AAV-mediated cardiac expression of wild-type desmin in both the homozygous DKO and DKI backgrounds reached levels seen in wild-type mice. Notably, AAV-Des treated DKO mice showed a regular subcellular distribution of desmin as well as a normalization of functional and morphological cardiac parameters. Treated DKI mice, however, showed an aberrant subcellular localization of desmin, unchanged functional cardiac parameters, and a trend toward an increased cardiac fibrosis. In conclusion, the effect of a high-dose AAV9-based desmin gene therapy is highly beneficial for the heart in DKO animals, but not in DKI mice.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-0147-7"
"gt","Muscle overexpression of Klf15 via an AAV8-Spc5-12 construct does not provide benefits in spinal muscular atrophy mice","Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disease caused by loss of the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene. While there are currently two approved gene-based therapies for SMA, availability, high cost, and differences in patient response indicate that alternative treatment options are needed. Optimal therapeutic strategies will likely be a combination of SMN-dependent and -independent treatments aimed at alleviating symptoms in the central nervous system and peripheral muscles. Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15) is a transcription factor that regulates key metabolic and ergogenic pathways in muscle. We have recently reported significant downregulation of Klf15 in muscle of presymptomatic SMA mice. Importantly, perinatal upregulation of Klf15 via transgenic and pharmacological methods resulted in improved disease phenotypes in SMA mice, including weight and survival. In the current study, we designed an adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) vector to overexpress a codon-optimized Klf15 cDNA under the muscle-specific Spc5-12 promoter (AAV8-Klf15). Administration of AAV8-Klf15 to severe Taiwanese Smn−/−;SMN2 or intermediate Smn2B/− SMA mice significantly increased Klf15 expression in muscle. We also observed significant activity of the AAV8-Klf15 vector in liver and heart. AAV8-mediated Klf15 overexpression moderately improved survival in the Smn2B/− model but not in the Taiwanese mice. An inability to specifically induce Klf15 expression at physiological levels in a time- and tissue-dependent manner may have contributed to this limited efficacy. Thus, our work demonstrates that an AAV8-Spc5-12 vector induces high gene expression as early as P2 in several tissues including muscle, heart, and liver, but highlights the challenges of achieving meaningful vector-mediated transgene expression of Klf15.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-0146-8"

Furthermore, ease of accessibility and ocular immune privilege makes the retina an ideal target for gene therapies. In this study, the nuclear hormone receptor gene Nr2e3 was evaluated for efficacy as broad-spectrum therapy to attenuate early to intermediate stages of retinal degeneration in five unique mouse models of retinitis pigmentosa (RP). RP is a group of heterogenic inherited retinal diseases associated with over 150 gene mutations, affecting over 1.5 million individuals worldwide. RP varies in age of onset, severity, and rate of progression. In addition, ~40% of RP patients cannot be genetically diagnosed, confounding the ability to develop personalized RP therapies. Remarkably, Nr2e3 administered therapy resulted in reduced retinal degeneration as observed by increase in photoreceptor cells, improved electroretinogram, and a dramatic molecular reset of key transcription factors and associated gene networks. These therapeutic effects improved retinal homeostasis in diseased tissue. Results of this study provide evidence that Nr2e3 can serve as a broad-spectrum therapy to treat multiple forms of RP.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-0134-z"

Few reports, however, have examined the utility of pigs in gene therapy. Pigs are potentially useful in preclinical studies because of their anatomical and physiological similarity to humans. Here, we evaluated the utility of microminipigs for liver-targeted gene therapy. These pigs were intravenously inoculated with an AAV8 vector encoding the luciferase gene, and gene expression was assessed by an in vivo imaging system. Robust transgene expression was observed almost exclusively in the liver, even though the pig showed a low-titer of neutralizing antibody (NAb) against the AAV8 capsid. We assessed the action of NAbs against AAV, which interfere with AAV vector-mediated gene transfer by intravascular delivery. When a standard dose of vector was administered intravenously, transgene expression was observed in both NAb-negative and low-titer (14×)-positive subjects, whereas gene expression was not observed in animals with higher titers (56×). These results are compatible with our previous observations using nonhuman primates, indicating that pigs are useful in gene therapy experiments, and that the role of low-titer NAb in intravenous administration of the AAV vector shows similarities across species.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-020-0125-0"
"gt","Integrating gene delivery and gene-editing technologies by adenoviral vector transfer of optimized CRISPR-Cas9 components","Enhancing the intracellular delivery and performance of RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases (RGNs) remains in demand. Here, we show that nuclear translocation of commonly used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) proteins is suboptimal. Hence, we generated eCas9.4NLS by endowing the high-specificity eSpCas9(1.1) nuclease (eCas9.2NLS) with additional nuclear localization signals (NLSs). We demonstrate that eCas9.4NLS coupled to prototypic or optimized guide RNAs achieves efficient targeted DNA cleavage and probe the performance of SpCas9 proteins with different NLS compositions at target sequences embedded in heterochromatin versus euchromatin. Moreover, after adenoviral vector (AdV)-mediated transfer of SpCas9 expression units, unbiased quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy revealed 2.3-fold higher eCas9.4NLS nuclear enrichment levels than those observed for high-specificity eCas9.2NLS. This improved nuclear translocation yielded in turn robust gene editing after nonhomologous end joining repair of targeted double-stranded DNA breaks. In particular, AdV delivery of eCas9.4NLS into muscle progenitor cells resulted in significantly higher editing frequencies at defective DMD alleles causing Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) than those achieved by AdVs encoding the parental, eCas9.2NLS, protein. In conclusion, this work provides a strong rationale for integrating viral vector and optimized gene-editing technologies to bring about enhanced RGN delivery and performance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-019-0119-y"

"gt","Transduction optimization of AAV vectors for human gene therapy of glaucoma and their reversed cell entry characteristics","The trabecular meshwork (TM) of the eye is responsible for maintaining physiological intraocular pressure (IOP). Dysfunction of this tissue results in elevated IOP, subsequent optic nerve damage and glaucoma, the world’s leading cause of irreversible blindness. IOP regulation by delivering candidate TM genes would offer an enormous clinical advantage to the current daily-drops/surgery treatment. Initially, we showed that a double-stranded AAV2 (scAAV2) transduced the human TM very efficiently, while its single-stranded form (ssAAV2) did not. Here, we quantified transduction and entry of single- and double-strand serotypes 1, 2.5, 5, 6, 8, and 9 in primary, single individual-derived human TM cells (HTM). scAAV2 exhibited highest transduction in all individuals, distantly followed by scAAV2.5, scAAV6, and scAAV5. Transduction of scAAV1, scAAV8, and scAAV9 was negligible. None of the ssAAV serotypes transduced, but their cell entries were significantly higher than those of their corresponding scAAV. Tyrosine scAAV2 capsid mutants increased transduction in HTM cultured cells and all TM-outflow layers of perfused postmortem human eyes. These studies provide the first serotype optimization for gene therapy of glaucoma in humans. They further reveal biological differences between the AAV forms in HTM cells, whose understanding could contribute to the development of gene therapy of glaucoma.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-019-0105-4"
"gt","Downregulation of the human peripheral myelin protein 22 gene by miR-29a in cellular models of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease","The majority of hereditary neuropathies are caused by duplication of the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) gene. Therefore, mechanisms to suppress the expression of the PMP22 gene have high therapeutic significance. Here we asked whether the human PMP22 gene is a target for regulation by microRNA 29a (miR-29a). Using bioinformatics, we determined that the human PMP22 gene contains the conserved seed sequence of the miR-29a binding site and this regulatory motif is included in the duplicated region in neuropathic patients. Using luciferase reporter assays in HEK293 cells, we demonstrated that transient transfection of a miR-29a mimic is associated with reduction in PMP22 3′UTR reporter activity. Transfecting normal and humanized transgenic neuropathic mouse Schwann cells with a miR-29a expression plasmid effectively lowered both the endogenous mouse and the transgenic human PMP22 transcripts compared with control vector. In dermal fibroblasts derived from neuropathic patients, ectopic expression of miR-29a led to ~50% reduction in PMP22 mRNA, which corresponded to ~20% decrease in PMP22 protein levels. Significantly, miR-29a-mediated reduction in PMP22 mitigated the reduced mitotic capacity of the neuropathic cells. Together, these results support further testing of miR-29a and/or PMP22-targeting siRNAs as therapeutic agents for correcting the aberrant expression of PMP22 in neuropathic patients.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-019-0098-z"
"gt","Inside out: optimization of lipid nanoparticle formulations for exterior complexation and in vivo delivery of saRNA","Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) is a promising biotherapeutic tool that has been used as a vaccine against both infectious diseases and cancer. saRNA has been shown to induce protein expression for up to 60 days and elicit immune responses with lower dosing than messenger RNA (mRNA). Because saRNA is a large (~9500 nt), negatively charged molecule, it requires a delivery vehicle for efficient cellular uptake and degradation protection. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have been widely used for RNA formulations, where the prevailing paradigm is to encapsulate RNA within the particle, including the first FDA-approved small-interfering siRNA therapy. Here, we compared LNP formulations with cationic and ionizable lipids with saRNA either on the interior or exterior of the particle. We show that LNPs formulated with cationic lipids protect saRNA from RNAse degradation, even when it is adsorbed to the surface. Furthermore, cationic LNPs deliver saRNA equivalently to particles formulated with saRNA encapsulated in an ionizable lipid particle, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that cationic and ionizable LNP formulations induce equivalent antibodies against HIV-1 Env gp140 as a model antigen. These studies establish formulating saRNA on the surface of cationic LNPs as an alternative to the paradigm of encapsulating RNA.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-019-0095-2"
"gt","A next-generation sequencing method for gene doping detection that distinguishes low levels of plasmid DNA against a background of genomic DNA","Gene doping confers health risks for athletes and is a threat to fair competition in sports. Therefore the anti-doping community has given attention on its detection. Previously published polymerase chain reaction-based methodologies for gene doping detection are targeting exon–exon junctions in the intron-less transgene. However, because these junctions are known, it would be relatively easy to evade detection by tampering with the copyDNA sequences. We have developed a targeted next-generation sequencing based assay for the detection of all exon–exon junctions of the potential doping genes, EPO, IGF1, IGF2, GH1, and GH2, which is resistant to tampering. Using this assay, all exon–exon junctions of copyDNA of doping genes could be detected with a sensitivity of 1296 copyDNA copies in 1000 ng of genomic DNA. In addition, promotor regions and plasmid-derived sequences are readily detectable in our sequence data. While we show the reliability of our method for a selection of genes, expanding the panel to detect other genes would be straightforward. As we were able to detect plasmid-derived sequences, we expect that genes with manipulated junctions, promotor regions, and plasmid or virus-derived sequences will also be readily detected.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-019-0091-6"

Unfortunately, the vast majority of patients may not benefit from cell and gene therapies.

Gene delivery to the CNS has largely been neuron centric but advances in AAV technology are facilitating the development of approaches to enable transduction of glial cells. Considering the role of astrocytes in the on-going secondary damage in spinal cord injury (SCI), an AAV vector that targets astrocytes could show benefit as a potential treatment. Transduction efficiency, transgene expression and cellular tropism were compared for the AAV serotypes AAV5, AAV9 and AAVRec2 whereby destabilised yellow fluorescent protein (dYFP) was controlled by the GFAP or the truncated GfaABC1D promoter. The vectors were tested in primary spinal cord astrocyte cell culture, spinal cord slice culture and an in vivo model of SCI contusion. AAV5 resulted in greater transduction efficiency, transgene expression and astrocyte tropism compared with AAV9 and AAVRec2. In a rodent model of SCI, robust transgene expression by AAV5-GFAP/GfaABC1D-dYFP was observed through 12 mm of spinal cord tissue and expression was largely restricted to astrocytes. Thus, AAV5-GFAP/GfaABC1D carries the potential as a potential gene therapy vector, particularly for transducing astrocytes in the damaged spinal cord.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-019-0075-6"
"gt","Production of lentiviral vectors using novel, enzymatically produced, linear DNA","The manufacture of large quantities of high-quality DNA is a major bottleneck in the production of viral vectors for gene therapy. Touchlight Genetics has developed a proprietary abiological technology that addresses the major issues in commercial DNA supply. The technology uses ‘rolling-circle’ amplification to produce large quantities of concatameric DNA that is then processed to create closed linear double-stranded DNA by enzymatic digestion. This novel form of DNA, Doggybone™ DNA (dbDNA™), is structurally distinct from plasmid DNA. Here we compare lentiviral vectors production from dbDNA™ and plasmid DNA. Lentiviral vectors were administered to neonatal mice via intracerebroventricular injection. Luciferase expression was quantified in conscious mice continually by whole-body bioluminescent imaging. We observed long-term luciferase expression using dbDNA™-derived vectors, which was comparable to plasmid-derived lentivirus vectors. Here we have demonstrated that functional lentiviral vectors can be produced using the novel dbDNA™ configuration for delivery in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, this could enable lentiviral vector packaging of complex DNA sequences that have previously been incompatible with bacterial propagation systems, as dbDNA™ technology could circumvent such restrictions through its phi29-based rolling-circle amplification.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-018-0056-1"

"gt","GDNF-mediated rescue of the nigrostriatal system depends on the degree of degeneration","Glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a promising therapeutic molecule to treat Parkinson’s disease. Despite an excellent profile in experimental settings, clinical trials testing GDNF have failed. One of the theories to explain these negative outcomes is that the clinical trials were done in late-stage patients that have advanced nigrostriatal degeneration and may therefore not respond to a neurotrophic factor therapy. Based on this idea, we tested if the stage of nigrostriatal degeneration is important for GDNF-based therapies. Lentiviral vectors expressing regulated GDNF were delivered to the striatum of rats to allow GDNF expression to be turned on either while the nigrostriatal system was degenerating or after the nigrostriatal system had been fully lesioned by 6-OHDA. In the group of animals where GDNF expression was on during degeneration, neurons were rescued and there was a reversal of motor deficits. Turning GDNF expression on after the nigrostriatal system was lesioned did not rescue neurons or reverse motor deficits. In fact, these animals were indistinguishable from the control groups. Our results suggest that GDNF can reverse motor deficits and nigrostriatal pathology despite an ongoing nigrostriatal degeneration, if there is still a sufficient number of remaining neurons to respond to therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-018-0049-0"
"gt","Immunosuppression overcomes insulin- and vector-specific immune responses that limit efficacy of AAV2/8-mediated insulin gene therapy in NOD mice","We report the restoration of euglycaemia in chemically induced diabetic C57BL/6 mice and spontaneously diabetic Non Obese Diabetic (NOD) mice by intravenous systemic administration of a single-stranded adeno-associated virus (ssAAV2/8) codon optimised (co) vector encoding furin cleavable human proinsulin under a liver-specific promoter. There were no immunological barriers to efficacy of insulin gene therapy in chemically induced C57BL/6 mice, which enjoyed long-lasting correction of hyperglycaemia after therapy, up to 250 days. Euglycaemia was also restored in spontaneously diabetic NOD mice, although these mice required a 7–10-fold higher dose of vector to achieve similar efficacy as the C57BL/6 mice and the immunodeficient NODscid mice. We detected CD8+ T cell reactivity to insulin and mild inflammatory infiltration in the livers of gene therapy recipient NOD mice, neither of which were observed in the treated C57BL/6 mice. Efficacy of the gene therapy in NOD mice was partially improved by targeting the immune system with anti-CD4 antibody treatment, while transfer of NOD mouse AAV2/8-reactive serum to recipients prevented successful restoration of euglycaemia in AAV2/8-HLP-hINSco-treated NODscid mice. Our data indicate that both immune cells and antibodies form a barrier to successful restoration of euglycaemia in autoimmune diabetic recipient mice with insulin gene therapy, but that this barrier can be overcome by increasing the dose of vector and by suppressing immune responses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-018-0052-5"

We recently optimized our IL-12 gene delivery platform to increase transgene expression and efficacy in preclinical models. Here we analyze the immunological changes induced with the new IT-pIL12/EP platform in both electroporated and distant, non-electroporated lesions. IT-pIL12/EP-treated tumors demonstrated rapid induction of IL-12-regulated pathways, as well as other cytokines and chemokines pathways, and upregulation of antigen presentation machinery. The distant tumors showed an increase in infiltrating lymphocytes and gene expression changes indicative of a de novo immune response in these untreated lesions. Flow cytometric analyses revealed a KLRG1hi CD8+ effector T-cell population uniquely present in mice treated with IT-pIL12/EP. Despite being highly activated, this population expressed diminished levels of PD-1 when re-exposed to antigen in the PD-L1-rich tumor. Other T-cell exhaustion markers appeared to be downregulated in concert, suggesting an orchestrated “armoring” of these effector T cells against T-cell checkpoints when primed in the presence of IL-12 in situ. These cells may represent an important mechanism by which local IL-12 gene therapy can induce a systemic antitumor immune response without the associated toxicity of systemic IL-12 exposure.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-018-0044-5"
"gt","Epistasis between Pax6Sey and genetic background reinforces the value of defined hybrid mouse models for therapeutic trials","The small eye (Sey) mouse is a model of PAX6-aniridia syndrome (aniridia). Aniridia, a congenital ocular disorder caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in PAX6, needs new vision saving therapies. However, high phenotypic variability in Sey mice makes development of such therapies challenging. We hypothesize that genetic background is a major source of undesirable variability in Sey mice. Here we performed a systematic quantitative examination of anatomical, histological, and molecular phenotypes on the inbred C57BL/6J, hybrid B6129F1, and inbred 129S1/SvImJ backgrounds. The Sey allele significantly reduced eye weight, corneal thickness, PAX6 mRNA and protein levels, and elevated blood glucose levels. Surprisingly, Pax6Sey/Sey brains had significantly elevated Pax6 transcripts compared to Pax6+/+ embryos. Genetic background significantly influenced 12/24 measurements, with inbred strains introducing severe ocular and blood sugar phenotypes not observed in hybrid mice. Additionally, significant interactions (epistasis) between Pax6 genotype and genetic background were detected in measurements of eye weight, cornea epithelial thickness and cell count, retinal mRNA levels, and blood glucose levels. The number of epistatic interactions was reduced in hybrid mice. In conclusion, severe phenotypes in the unnatural inbred strains reinforce the value of more naturalistic F1 hybrid mice for the development of therapies for aniridia and other disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-018-0043-6"

High-yield manufacturing of high-quality vectors can be achieved using the baculovirus expression vector system. However, efficient production of rAAV in this insect cell-based system requires a genetic redesign of the viral protein 1 (VP1) operon. In this study, we generated a library of rationally designed rAAV serotype 5 variants with modulations in the translation-initiation region of VP1 and investigated the potency of the resulting vectors. We found that the initiation strength at the VP1 translational start had downstream effects on the VP2/VP3 ratio. Excessive incorporation of VP3 into a vector type decreased potency, even when the VP1/VP2 ratio was in balance. Finally, we successfully generated a potent rAAV vector based on serotype 5 with a balanced VP1/VP2/VP3 stoichiometry.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-018-0034-7"

Here, we evaluate the use of rSIV.F/HN for production of secreted proteins. We assessed whether rSIV.F/HN transduction of the lung generates therapeutically relevant levels of secreted proteins in the lung and systemic circulation using human α1-anti-trypsin (hAAT) and factor VIII (hFVIII) as exemplars. Sedated mice were transduced with rSIV.F/HN carrying either the secreted reporter gene Gaussia luciferase or the hAAT or hFVIII cDNAs by nasal sniffing. rSIV.F/HN-hAAT transduction lead to therapeutically relevant hAAT levels (70 μg/ml) in epithelial lining fluid, with stable expression persisting for at least 19 months from a single application. Secreted proteins produced in the lung were released into the circulation and stable expression was detectable in blood. The levels of hFVIII in murine blood approached therapeutically relevant targets. rSIV.F/HN was also able to produce secreted hAAT and hFVIII in transduced human primary airway cells. rSIV.F/HN transduction of the murine lungs leads to long-lasting and therapeutically relevant levels of secreted proteins in the lung and systemic circulation. These data broaden the use of this vector platform for a large range of disease indications.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-018-0025-8"

To increase the potency of adoptively transferred T cells, patients are conditioned with lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimens prior to adoptive T-cell transfer (ACT), and data suggest that fludarabine is an important component of an effective regimen. In a recent clinical trial using CAR-T cells engineered to target the CD19 B-cell antigen to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia, JCAR-015 (NCT02535364), two patient deaths due to cerebral edema led to trial suspension. The lymphodepleting agent fludarabine was suggested as the causative agent, in part due to its known association with neurotoxicity and its ability to induce greater potency. In a similar CAR-T study also incorporating fludarabine in the preconditioning regimen, ZUMA-1 (NCT02348216), one patient died of cerebral edema. However, subsequent deaths in the JCAR-015 study after removal of fludarabine and improved understanding behind the mechanisms of CAR-T-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES) indicate that fludarabine is not the primary causative agent of cerebral edema and that it can be safely incorporated into the preconditioning regimen for ACT. Since entering clinical use in the late 1980s as a chemotherapy agent, fludarabine and similar analogs have been associated with lethal neurological toxicity, yet the manifestation and timing of symptoms are distinct to those observed recently in ACT. Herein, we review the history of fludarabine development as a chemotherapeutic agent, and discuss the safety of its continued use in preconditioning regimens for ACT.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-018-0019-6"

These diseases are promising targets for genetic interventions. Gene therapies using viral vectors have been used to introduce correct copies of the disease-causing gene in preclinical and clinical studies. However, these studies highlighted that disease-alleviating gene expression is lost over time. Integration into a specific chromosomal site could provide lasting therapeutic expression to overcome this major limitation. Additionally, targeted integration could avoid detrimental mutagenesis associated with integrative vectors, such as tumorigenesis or functional gene perturbation. To test if adenoviral vectors can facilitate long-term gene expression through targeted integration, we somatically incorporated the human alpha-1-antitrypsin gene into the ROSA26 “safe harbor” locus in murine livers, using CRISPR/Cas9. We found adenoviral-mediated delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 achieved gene editing outcomes persisting over 200 days. Furthermore, gene knock-in maintained greater levels of the serum protein than provided by episomal expression. Importantly, our “knock-in” approach is generalizable to other serum proteins and supports in vivo cDNA replacement therapy to achieve stable gene expression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-018-0003-1"

Since this synapse provides the major information pathway from the cochlea to the auditory brain, it is important to maintain its integrity. Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) has been known to play an important role in the development and the functional maintenance of this synapse. Application of exogenous NT-3, or overexpression of this gene in a transgenic animal model, have shown the value to protect this synapse from noise-induced damage. In the present study, NT-3 overexpression was induced by cochlear gene transfection before noise exposure via the use of an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector. We found that such an overexpression provided a significant synaptic protection against a noise exposure that caused massive damage to the synapses, likely due to it promoting the repair of the synapse after the initial damage.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41434-018-0012-0"

This study compared three of the most efficacious AAV vectors known to date in a mouse model of retinal degeneration (rd1 mouse) and macaque and human retinal explants. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by a ubiquitous promoter was packaged into three AAV capsids: AAV2/8(Y733F), AAV2/2(quad Y-F) and AAV2/2(7m8). Overall, AAV2/2(7m8) transduced the largest area of retina and resulted in the highest level of GFP expression, followed by AAV2/2(quad Y-F) and AAV2/8(Y733F). AAV2/2(7m8) and AAV2/2(quad Y-F) both resulted in similar patterns of transduction whether they were injected intravitreally or subretinally. AAV2/8(Y733F) transduced a significantly smaller area of retina when injected intravitreally compared with subretinally. Retinal ganglion cells, horizontal cells and retinal pigment epithelium expressed relatively high levels of GFP in the mouse retina, whereas amacrine cells expressed low levels of GFP and bipolar cells were infrequently transduced. Cone cells were the most frequently transduced cell type in macaque retina explants, whereas Müller cells were the predominant transduced cell type in human retinal explants.

Here, we demonstrate the delivery and immunogenicity of a DNA vaccine into subcutaneous adipose tissue cells using noninvasive EP. Using finite element analysis, we predicted that plate electrodes, when oriented properly, could effectively concentrate the electric field within adipose tissue. In practice, these electrodes generated widespread gene expression persisting for at least 60 days in vivo within interscapular subcutaneous fat pads of guinea pigs. We then applied this adipose-EP protocol to deliver a DNA vaccine coding for an influenza antigen into guinea pigs. The resulting host immune responses elicited were of a similar magnitude to those achieved by skin delivery with EP. The onset of the humoral immune response was more rapid when the DNA dose was spread over multiple injection sites, and increasing the voltage of the EP device increased the magnitude of the immune response. This study supports further development of EP protocols delivering gene-based therapies to subcutaneous fat.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201796"

However, individuals with pre-existing immunity to adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) may be less likely to benefit from AAV vector-based therapies. To study pre-existing AAV5 immunity in humans, we validated two complementary, sensitive, and scalable in vitro assays to detect AAV5 total antibodies and transduction inhibition (TI). Using these two assays, we found that 53% of samples from 100 healthy male individuals were negative in both assays, 18% were positive in both assays, 5% were positive for total antibodies but negative for TI and, of interest, 24% were negative for total antibodies but positive for TI activity, suggesting the presence of non-antibody-based neutralizing factors in human plasma. Similar findings were obtained with 24 samples from individuals with hemophilia A. On the basis of these results, we describe the development of a dual-assay strategy to identify individuals without total AAV5 antibodies or neutralizing factors who may be more likely to respond to AAV5-directed gene therapy. These assays offer a universal, transferrable platform across laboratories to assess the global prevalence of AAV5 antibodies and neutralizing factors in large patient populations to help inform clinical development strategies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201795"

However, scaling up the production methods of LVs in order to produce high-quality vectors for clinical purposes has proven to be difficult. In this article, we present a scalable and efficient method to produce LVs with transient transfection of adherent 293T cells in a fixed-bed bioreactor. The disposable iCELLis bioreactors are scalable with a large three-dimensional (3D) growth area range between 0.53 and 500 m2, an integrated perfusion system, and a controllable environment for production. In this study, iCELLis Nano (2.67–4 m2) was used for optimizing production parameters for scale-up. Transfections were first done using traditional calcium phosphate method, but in later runs polyethylenimine was found to be more reliable and easier to use. For scalable LV production, perfusion rate control by measuring cell metabolite concentrations in the bioreactor leads to higher productivity and reduced costs. Optimization of cell seeding density for targeted cell concentration during transfection, use of low compaction fixed-bed and lowering the culture pH have a positive effect on LV productivity. These results show for the first time that iCELLis bioreactor is scalable from bench level to clinical scale LV production.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201791"

Cancer-targeting gene virotherapy using oncolytic adenoviruses (OAds) armed with anticancer genes has shown efficacy and safety in clinical trials. Nowadays, both inhibitor of growth 4 (ING4), as a multimodal tumor suppressor gene, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), as a potent apoptosis-inducing gene, are experiencing a renaissance in cancer gene therapy. Herein we investigated the antitumor activity and safety of mono- and combined therapy with OAds armed with ING4 (Ad-ΔB/ING4) and TRAIL (Ad-ΔB/TRAIL) gene, respectively, on preclinical models of human HCC. OAd-mediated expression of ING4 or TRAIL transgene was confirmed. Ad-ΔB/TRAIL and/or Ad-ΔB/ING4 exhibited potent killing effect on human HCC cells (HuH7 and Hep3B) but not on normal liver cells. Most importantly, systemic therapy with Ad-ΔB/ING4 plus Ad-ΔB/TRAIL elicited more eradicative effect on an orthotopic mouse model of human HCC than their monotherapy, without causing obvious overlapping toxicity. Mechanistically, Ad-ΔB/ING4 and Ad-ΔB/TRAIL were remarkably cooperated to induce antitumor apoptosis and immune response, and to repress tumor angiogenesis. This is the first study showing that concomitant therapy with Ad-ΔB/ING4 and Ad-ΔB/TRAIL may provide a potential strategy for HCC therapy and merits further investigations to realize its possible clinical translation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201786"

Reflecting their high mutation rates, occurrences of target oligonucleotides evidently fluctuate in viral populations and often disappear. Time-series analysis of the one-base changed sequences derived from each original target identified the oligonucleotide that shows a compensatory increase and will potentially become the ‘awaiting-type oligonucleotide’; the combined use of this oligonucleotide with the original can provide therapeutics with long utility.

To date, there is no treatment to halt or reverse the course of HD. Lowering of either total or only the mutant HTT expression is expected to have therapeutic benefit. This can be achieved by engineered micro (mi)RNAs targeting HTT transcripts and delivered by an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector. We have previously showed a miHTT construct to induce total HTT knock-down in Hu128/21 HD mice, while miSNP50T and miSNP67T constructs induced allele-selective HTT knock-down in vitro. In the current preclinical study, the mechanistic efficacy and gene specificity of these selected constructs delivered by an AAV serotype 5 (AAV5) vector was addressed using an acute HD rat model. Our data demonstrated suppression of mutant HTT messenger RNA, which almost completely prevented mutant HTT aggregate formation, and ultimately resulted in suppression of DARPP-32-associated neuronal dysfunction. The AAV5-miHTT construct was found to be the most efficient, although AAV5-miSNP50T demonstrated the anticipated mutant HTT allele selectivity and no passenger strand expression. Ultimately, AAV5-delivered-miRNA-mediated HTT lowering did not cause activation of microglia or astrocytes suggesting no immune response to the AAV5 vector or therapeutic precursor sequences. These preclinical results suggest that using gene therapy to knock-down HTT may provide important therapeutic benefit for HD patients and raised no safety concerns, which supports our ongoing efforts for the development of an RNA interference-based gene therapy product for HD.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201771"
"gt","AAV9-based gene therapy partially ameliorates the clinical phenotype of a mouse model of Leigh syndrome","Leigh syndrome (LS) is the most common infantile mitochondrial encephalopathy. No treatment is currently available for this condition. Mice lacking Ndufs4, encoding NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase iron-sulfur protein 4 (NDUFS4) recapitulates the main findings of complex I (cI)-related LS, including severe multisystemic cI deficiency and progressive neurodegeneration. In order to develop a gene therapy approach for LS, we used here an AAV2/9 vector carrying the human NDUFS4 coding sequence (hNDUFS4). We administered AAV2/9-hNDUFS4 by intravenous (IV) and/or intracerebroventricular (ICV) routes to either newborn or young Ndufs4−/− mice. We found that IV administration alone was only able to correct the cI deficiency in peripheral organs, whereas ICV administration partially corrected the deficiency in the brain. However, both treatments failed to improve the clinical phenotype or to prolong the lifespan of Ndufs4−/− mice. In contrast, combined IV and ICV treatments resulted, along with increased cI activity, in the amelioration of the rotarod performance and in a significant prolongation of the lifespan. Our results indicate that extraneurological organs have an important role in LS pathogenesis and provide an insight into current limitations of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy in multisystem disorders. These findings warrant future investigations to develop new vectors able to efficiently target multiple organs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201753"
"gt","The importance of international collaboration for rare diseases research: a European perspective","Over the last two decades, important contributions were made at national, European and international levels to foster collaboration into rare diseases research. The European Union (EU) has put much effort into funding rare diseases research, encouraging national funding organizations to collaborate together in the E-Rare program, setting up European Reference Networks for rare diseases and complex conditions, and initiating the International Rare Diseases Research Consortium (IRDiRC) together with the National Institutes of Health in the USA. Co-ordination of the activities of funding agencies, academic researchers, companies, regulatory bodies, and patient advocacy organizations and partnerships with, for example, the European Research Infrastructures maximizes the collective impact of global investments in rare diseases research. This contributes to accelerating progress, for example, in faster diagnosis through enhanced discovery of causative genes, better understanding of natural history of rare diseases through creation of common registries and databases and boosting of innovative therapeutic approaches. Several examples of funded pre-clinical and clinical gene therapy projects show that integration of multinational and multidisciplinary expertize generates new knowledge and can result in multicentre gene therapy trials. International collaboration in rare diseases research is key to improve the life of people living with a rare disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201729"
"gt","The clinical landscape for SMA in a new therapeutic era","Despite significant advances in basic research, the treatment of degenerative diseases of the nervous system remains one of the greatest challenges for translational medicine. The childhood onset motor neuron disorder spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) has been viewed as one of the more tractable targets for molecular therapy due to a detailed understanding of the molecular genetic basis of the disease. In SMA, inactivating mutations in the SMN1 gene can be partially compensated for by limited expression of SMN protein from a variable number of copies of the SMN2 gene, which provides both a molecular explanation for phenotypic severity and a target for therapy. The advent of the first tailored molecular therapy for SMA, based on modulating the splicing behaviour of the SMN2 gene provides, for the first time, a treatment which alters the natural history of motor neuron degeneration. Here we consider how this will change the landscape for diagnosis, clinical management and future therapeutic trials in SMA, as well as the implications for the molecular therapy of other neurological diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201752"
"gt","Characterization of retroviral infectivity and superinfection resistance during retrovirus-mediated transduction of mammalian cells","Retroviral vectors including lentiviral vectors are commonly used tools to stably express transgenes or RNA molecules in mammalian cells. Their utilities are roughly divided into two categories, stable overexpression of transgenes and RNA molecules, which requires maximal transduction efficiency, or functional selection with retrovirus (RV)-based libraries, which takes advantage of retroviral superinfection resistance. However, the dynamic features of RV-mediated transduction are not well characterized. Here, we engineered two murine stem cell virus-based retroviral vectors expressing dual fluorescence proteins and antibiotic markers, and analyzed virion production efficiency and virion stability, dynamic infectivity and superinfection resistance in different cell types, and strategies to improve transduction efficiency. We found that the highest virion production occurred between 60 and 72 h after transfection. The stability of the collected virion supernatant decreased by >60% after 3 days in storage. We found that RV infectivity varied drastically in the tested human cancer lines, while low transduction efficiency was partially overcome with increased virus titer, prolonged infection duration and/or repeated infections. Furthermore, we demonstrated that RV receptors PIT1 and PIT2 were lowly expressed in the analyzed cells, and that PIT1 and/or PIT2 overexpression significantly improved transduction efficiency in certain cell lines. Thus, our findings provide resourceful information for the optimal conditions of retroviral-mediated gene delivery.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201724"

AAV5-CAG-GFP (1 × 1013 vector genomes per milliliter (vg ml−1)) was bilaterally infused either into putamen, thalamus or with the combination left putamen and right thalamus. Robust expression of GFP was seen throughout infusion sites and also in other distal nuclei. Interestingly, thalamic infusion of AAV5 resulted in the transduction of the entire corticospinal axis, indicating transport of AAV5 over long distances. Regardless of site of injection, AAV5 transduced both neurons and astrocytes equally. Our data demonstrate that AAV5 is a very powerful vector for the central nervous system and has potential for treatment of a wide range of neurological pathologies with cortical, subcortical and/or spinal cord affection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201714"
"gt","Live-cell imaging to compare the transfection and gene silencing efficiency of calcium phosphate nanoparticles and a liposomal transfection agent","The processing of DNA (for transfection) and short interfering RNA (siRNA; for gene silencing), introduced into HeLa cells by triple-shell calcium phosphate nanoparticles, was followed by live-cell imaging. For comparison, the commercial liposomal transfection agent Lipofectamine was used. The cells were incubated with these delivery systems, carrying either enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-encoding DNA or siRNA against eGFP. In the latter case, HeLa cells that stably expressed eGFP were used. The expression of eGFP started after 5 h in the case of nanoparticles and after 4 h in the case of Lipofectamine. The corresponding times for gene silencing were 5 h (nanoparticles) and immediately after incubation (Lipofectamine). The expression of eGFP was notably enhanced 2–3 h after cell division (mitosis). In general, the transfection and gene silencing efficiencies of the nanoparticles were lower than those of Lipofectamime, even at a substantially higher dose (factor 20) of nucleic acids. However, the cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles was lower than that of Lipofectamine, making them suitable vectors for in vivo application.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201713"

In particular, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) has shown promise in animal and cell models of Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here, systemic AAV9-GDNF was delivered via tail vein injections to young rats to determine whether this could be a safe and functional strategy to treat the SOD1G93A rat model of ALS and, therefore, translated to a therapy for ALS patients. We found that GDNF administration in this manner resulted in modest functional improvement, whereby grip strength was maintained for longer and the onset of forelimb paralysis was delayed compared to non-treated rats. This did not, however, translate into an extension in survival. In addition, ALS rats receiving GDNF exhibited slower weight gain, reduced activity levels and decreased working memory. Collectively, these results confirm that caution should be applied when applying growth factors such as GDNF systemically to multiple tissues.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt20179"
"gt","Extraneuronal pathology in a canine model of CLN2 neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis after intracerebroventricular gene therapy that delays neurological disease progression","CLN2 neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis is a hereditary lysosomal storage disease with primarily neurological signs that results from mutations in TPP1, which encodes the lysosomal enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (TPP1). Studies using a canine model for this disorder demonstrated that delivery of TPP1 enzyme to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by intracerebroventricular administration of an AAV-TPP1 vector resulted in substantial delays in the onset and progression of neurological signs and prolongation of life span. We hypothesized that the treatment may not deliver therapeutic levels of this protein to tissues outside the central nervous system that also require TPP1 for normal lysosomal function. To test this hypothesis, dogs treated with CSF administration of AAV-TPP1 were evaluated for the development of non-neuronal pathology. Affected treated dogs exhibited progressive cardiac pathology reflected by elevated plasma cardiac troponin-1, impaired cardiac function and development of histopathological myocardial lesions. Progressive increases in the plasma activity levels of alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase indicated development of pathology in the liver and muscles. The treatment also did not prevent disease-related accumulation of lysosomal storage bodies in the heart or liver. These studies indicate that optimal treatment outcomes for CLN2 disease may require delivery of TPP1 systemically as well as directly to the central nervous system.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt20174"
"gt","Balanced secretion of anti-CEA × anti-CD3 diabody chains using the 2A self-cleaving peptide maximizes diabody assembly and tumor-specific cytotoxicity","Adoptive transfer of genetically engineered human cells secreting bispecific T-cell engagers has shown encouraging therapeutic effects in preclinical models of cancer. However, reducing the toxicity and improving the effectiveness of this emerging immunotherapeutic strategy will be critical to its successful application. We have demonstrated that for gene-based bispecific antibody strategies, two-chain diabodies have a better safety profile than single-chain tandem scFvs (single-chain variable fragments), because their reduced tendency to form aggregates reduces the risk of inducing antigen-independent T-cell activation. Here, we demonstrate that the incorporation of a 2A self-processing peptide derived from foot-and-mouth disease virus conveying co-translational cleavage into a two-chain anti-CD3 × anti-CEA diabody gene enables near-equimolar expression of diabody chains 1 and 2, and thus increases the final amount of assembled diabody. This was found to maximize diabody-mediated T-cell activation and cytotoxicity against carcinoembryonic antigen-positive tumor cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt20173"

Pancreatic cancer has a high M2 content that has shown responsive to anti-CD40 agonist therapy and CD40 may thus be a suitable target for immune activation in these patients. In this study, a novel oncolytic adenovirus armed with a trimerized membrane-bound extracellular CD40L (TMZ-CD40L) was evaluated as a treatment of pancreatic cancer. Further, the CD40L mechanisms of action were elucidated in cancer models. The results demonstrated that the virus transferring TMZ-CD40L had oncolytic capacity in pancreatic cancer cells and could control tumor progression. TMZ-CD40L was a potent stimulator of human myeloid cells and T-cell responses. Further, CD40L-mediated stimulation increased tumor-infiltrating T cells in vivo, which may be due to a direct activation of endothelial cells to upregulate receptors for lymphocyte attachment and transmigration. In conclusion, CD40L-mediated gene therapy is an interesting concept for the treatment of tumors with high levels of M2 macrophages, such as pancreatic cancer, and an oncolytic virus as carrier of CD40L may further boost tumor killing and immune activation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201680"
"gt","Development of an optimized AAV2/5 gene therapy vector for Leber congenital amaurosis owing to defects in RPE65","Leber congenital amaurosis is a group of inherited retinal dystrophies that cause severe sight impairment in childhood; RPE65-deficiency causes impaired rod photoreceptor function from birth and progressive impairment of cone photoreceptor function associated with retinal degeneration. In animal models of RPE65 deficiency, subretinal injection of recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) 2/2 vectors carrying RPE65 cDNA improves rod photoreceptor function, and intervention at an early stage of disease provides sustained benefit by protecting cone photoreceptors against retinal degeneration. In affected humans, administration of these vectors has resulted to date in relatively modest improvements in photoreceptor function, even when retinal degeneration is comparatively mild, and the duration of benefit is limited by progressive retinal degeneration. We conclude that the demand for RPE65 in humans is not fully met by current vectors, and predict that a more powerful vector will provide more durable benefit. With this aim we have modified the original AAV2/2 vector to generate AAV2/5-OPTIRPE65. The new configuration consists of an AAV vector serotype 5 carrying an optimized hRPE65 promoter and a codon-optimized hRPE65 gene. In mice, AAV2/5-OPTIRPE65 is at least 300-fold more potent than our original AAV2/2 vector.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201666"
"gt","Lentivirus-meditated frataxin gene delivery reverses genome instability in Friedreich ataxia patient and mouse model fibroblasts","Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by deficiency of frataxin protein, with the primary sites of pathology being the large sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia and the cerebellum. FRDA is also often accompanied by severe cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus. Frataxin is important in mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster (ISC) biogenesis and low-frataxin expression is due to a GAA repeat expansion in intron 1 of the FXN gene. FRDA cells are genomically unstable, with increased levels of reactive oxygen species and sensitivity to oxidative stress. Here we report the identification of elevated levels of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in FRDA patient and YG8sR FRDA mouse model fibroblasts compared to normal fibroblasts. Using lentivirus FXN gene delivery to FRDA patient and YG8sR cells, we obtained long-term overexpression of FXN mRNA and frataxin protein levels with reduced DSB levels towards normal. Furthermore, γ-irradiation of FRDA patient and YG8sR cells revealed impaired DSB repair that was recovered on FXN gene transfer. This suggests that frataxin may be involved in DSB repair, either directly by an unknown mechanism, or indirectly via ISC biogenesis for DNA repair enzymes, which may be essential for the prevention of neurodegeneration.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201661"
"gt","Construction and validation of an RNA trans-splicing molecule suitable to repair a large number of COL7A1 mutations","RNA trans-splicing has become a versatile tool in the gene therapy of monogenetic diseases. This technique is especially valuable for the correction of mutations in large genes such as COL7A1, which underlie the dystrophic subtype of the skin blistering disease epidermolysis bullosa. Over 800 mutations spanning the entire length of the COL7A1 gene have been associated with defects in type VII collagen, leading to excessive fragility of epithelial tissues, the hallmark of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB). In the present study, we designed an RNA trans-splicing molecule (RTM) that is capable of repairing any given mutation within a 4200 nucleotide region spanning the 3′ half of COL7A1. The selected RTM, RTM28, was able to induce accurate trans-splicing into endogenous COL7A1 pre-mRNA transcripts in a type VII collagen-deficient DEB patient-derived cell line. Correct trans-splicing was detected at the RNA level by semiquantitative RT-PCR and correction of full-length type VII collagen was confirmed at the protein level by immunofluorescence and western blot analyses. Our results demonstrate that RTM28, which covers >60% of all mutations reported in DEB and is thus the longest RTM described so far for the repair of COL7A1, represents a promising candidate for therapeutic applications.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201657"
"gt","Therapeutic efficacy in a hemophilia B model using a biosynthetic mRNA liver depot system","DNA-based gene therapy has considerable therapeutic potential, but the challenges associated with delivery continue to limit progress. Messenger RNA (mRNA) has the potential to provide for transient production of therapeutic proteins, without the need for nuclear delivery and without the risk of insertional mutagenesis. Here we describe the sustained delivery of therapeutic proteins in vivo in both rodents and non-human primates via nanoparticle-formulated mRNA. Nanoparticles formulated with lipids and lipid-like materials were developed for delivery of two separate mRNA transcripts encoding either human erythropoietin (hEPO) or factor IX (hFIX) protein. Dose-dependent protein production was observed for each mRNA construct. Upon delivery of hEPO mRNA in mice, serum EPO protein levels reached several orders of magnitude (>125 000-fold) over normal physiological values. Further, an increase in hematocrit (Hct) was established, demonstrating that the exogenous mRNA-derived protein maintained normal activity. The capacity of producing EPO in non-human primates via delivery of formulated mRNA was also demonstrated as elevated EPO protein levels were observed over a 72-h time course. Exemplifying the possible broad utility of mRNA drugs, therapeutically relevant amounts of human FIX (hFIX) protein were achieved upon a single intravenous dose of hFIX mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles in mice. In addition, therapeutic value was established within a hemophilia B (FIX knockout (KO)) mouse model by demonstrating a marked reduction in Hct loss following injury (incision) to FIX KO mice.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201646"
"gt","Development of an AAV9 coding for a 3XFLAG-TALEfrat#8-VP64 able to increase in vivo the human frataxin in YG8R mice","Artificially designed transcription activator-like effector (TALE) proteins fused to a transcription activation domain (TAD), such as VP64, are able to activate specific eukaryotic promoters. They thus provide a good tool for targeted gene regulation as a therapy. However, the efficacy of such an agent in vivo remains to be demonstrated as the majority of studies have been carried out in cell culture. We produced an adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9) coding for a TALEfrat#8 containing 13 repeat variable diresidues able to bind to the proximal promoter of human frataxin (FXN) gene. This TALEfrat#8 was fused with a 3XFLAG at its N terminal and a VP64 TAD at its C terminal, and driven by a CAG promoter. This AAV9_3XFLAG-TALEfrat#8-VP64 was injected intraperitoneally to 9-day-old and 4-month-old YG8R mice. After 1 month, the heart, muscle and liver were removed and their FXN mRNA and FXN protein were analyzed. The results show that the AAV9_3XFLAG-TALEfrat#8-VP64 increased the FXN mRNA and FXN protein in the three organs studied. These results corroborate our previous in vitro studies in the FRDA human fibroblasts. Our study indicates that an AAV coding for a TALE protein coupled with a TAD may be used to increase gene expression in vivo as a possible treatment not only for FRDA but also for other haploinsufficiency diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201636"
"gt","AAV9-mediated gene transfer of desmin ameliorates cardiomyopathy in desmin-deficient mice","Mutations of the human desmin (DES) gene cause autosomal dominant and recessive myopathies affecting skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue. Desmin knockout mice (DES-KO), which develop progressive myopathy and cardiomyopathy, mirror rare human recessive desminopathies in which mutations on both DES alleles lead to a complete ablation of desmin protein expression. Here, we investigated whether an adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer of wild-type desmin cDNA (AAV-DES) attenuates cardiomyopathy in these mice. Our approach leads to a partial reconstitution of desmin protein expression and the de novo formation of the extrasarcomeric desmin–syncoilin network in cardiomyocytes of treated animals. This finding was accompanied by reduced fibrosis and heart weights and improved systolic left-ventricular function when compared with control vector-treated DES-KO mice. Since the re-expression of desmin protein in cardiomyocytes of DES-KO mice restores the extrasarcomeric desmin–syncoilin cytoskeleton, attenuates the degree of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, and improves contractile function, AAV-mediated desmin gene transfer may be a novel and promising therapeutic approach for patients with cardiomyopathy due to the complete lack of desmin protein expression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201640"
"gt","Ultrasound-targeted hepatic delivery of factor IX in hemophiliac mice","Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) was used to direct the delivery of plasmid and transposase-based vectors encoding human factor IX (hFIX) to the livers of hemophilia B (FIX−/−) mice. The DNA vectors were incorporated into cationic lipid microbubbles, injected intravenously, and transfected into hepatocytes by acoustic cavitation of the bubbles as they transited the liver. Ultrasound parameters were identified that produced transfection of hepatocytes in vivo without substantial damage or bleeding in the livers of the FIX-deficient mice. These mice were treated with a conventional expression plasmid, or one containing a piggyBac transposon construct, and hFIX levels in the plasma and liver were evaluated at multiple time points after UTMD. We detected hFIX in the plasma by western blotting from mice treated with either plasmid during the 12 days after UTMD, and in the hepatocytes of treated livers by immunofluorescence. Reductions in clotting time and improvements in the percentage of FIX activity were observed for both plasmids, conventional (4.15±1.98%), and transposon based (2.70±.75%), 4 to 5 days after UTMD compared with untreated FIX (−/−) control mice (0.92±0.78%) (P=0.001 and P=0.012, respectively). Reduced clotting times persisted for both plasmids 12 days after treatment (reflecting percentage FIX activity of 3.12±1.56%, P=0.02 and 3.08±0.10%, P=0.001, respectively). Clotting times from an additional set of mice treated with pmGENIE3-hFIX were evaluated for long-term effects and demonstrated a persistent reduction in average clotting time 160 days after a single treatment. These data suggest that UTMD could be a minimally invasive, nonviral approach to enhance hepatic FIX expression in patients with hemophilia.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201623"
"gt","The relevance of coagulation factor X protection of adenoviruses in human sera","Intravenous delivery of adenoviruses is the optimal route for many gene therapy applications. Once in the blood, coagulation factor X (FX) binds to the adenovirus capsid and protects the virion from natural antibody and classical complement-mediated neutralisation in mice. However, to date, no studies have examined the relevance of this FX/viral immune protective mechanism in human samples. In this study, we assessed the effects of blocking FX on adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) activity in the presence of human serum. FX prevented human IgM binding directly to the virus. In individual human sera samples (n=25), approximately half of those screened inhibited adenovirus transduction only when the Ad5–FX interaction was blocked, demonstrating that FX protected the virus from neutralising components in a large proportion of human sera. In contrast, the remainder of sera tested had no inhibitory effects on Ad5 transduction and FX armament was not required for effective gene transfer. In human sera in which FX had a protective role, Ad5 induced lower levels of complement activation in the presence of FX. We therefore demonstrate for the first time the importance of Ad–FX protection in human samples and highlight subject variability and species-specific differences as key considerations for adenoviral gene therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201632"

CRISPR/Cas-mediated deletion of miR sequences within the genome requires multiple chromosomal deletions to remove all functional miR family members because of duplications. Here, we report a novel plasmid-based miR inhibitor system (PMIS) that expresses a new RNA molecule, which inhibits miR family members in cells and mice. The PMIS engineered RNA optimal secondary structure, flanking sequences and specific antisense miR oligonucleotide sequence bind the miR in a stable complex to inhibit miR activity. In cells, one PMIS can effectively inhibit miR family members that share the same seed sequence. The PMIS shows no off-target effects or toxicity and is highly specific for miRs sharing identical seed sequences. Transgenic mice expressing both PMIS-miR-17-18 and PMIS-miR-19-92 show similar phenotypes of miR-17-92-knockout mice. Interestingly, mice only expressing PMIS-miR-17-18 have developmental defects distinct from mice only expressing PMIS-miR-19-92 demonstrating usefulness of the PMIS system to dissect different functions of miRs within clusters. Different PMIS miR inhibitors can be linked together to knock down multiple miRs expressed from different chromosomes. Inhibition of the miR-17-92, miR-106a-363 and miR-106b-25 clusters reveals new mechanisms and developmental defects for these miRs. We report a new tool to dissect the role of miRs in development without genome editing, inhibit miR function in cells and as a potential new therapeutic reagent.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201622"

This is now possible utilizing bionic electrode arrays for focal delivery of naked (plasmid) DNA via gene electrotransfer. Here, we establish the properties of array-based electroporation affecting targeted gene delivery. An array with eight 300 μm platinum ring electrodes configured as a cochlear implant bionic interface was used to transduce HEK293 cell monolayers with a plasmid-DNA green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene construct. Electroporation parameters were pulse intensity, number, duration, separation and electrode configuration. The latter determined the shape of the electric fields, which were mapped using a voltage probe. Electrode array-based electroporation was found to require ~100 × lower applied voltages for cell transduction than conventional electroporation. This was found to be due to compression of the field lines orthogonal to the array. A circular area of GFP-positive cells was created when the electrodes were ganged together as four adjacent anodes and four cathodes, whereas alternating electrode polarity created a linear area of GFP-positive cells. The refinement of gene delivery parameters was validated in vivo in the guinea pig cochlea. These findings have significant clinical ramifications, where spatiotemporal control of gene expression can be predicted by manipulation of the electric field via current steering at a cellular level.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt20168"

Addition of therapeutic genes to the viral genome may increase the therapeutic efficacy of vaccinia. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of vaccinia virus expressing the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) in prostate cancer models, combining oncolysis, external beam radiotherapy and NIS-mediated radioiodide therapy. The NIS-expressing vaccinia virus (VV-NIS), GLV-1h153, was tested in in vitro analyzes of viral cell killing, combination with radiotherapy, NIS expression, cellular radioiodide uptake and apoptotic cell death in PC3, DU145, LNCaP and WPMY-1 human prostate cell lines. In vivo experiments were carried out in PC3 xenografts in CD1 nude mice to assess NIS expression and tumor radioiodide uptake. In addition, the therapeutic benefit of radioiodide treatment in combination with viral oncolysis and external beam radiotherapy was measured. In vitro viral cell killing of prostate cancers was dose- and time-dependent and was through apoptotic mechanisms. Importantly, combined virus therapy and iodizing radiation did not adversely affect oncolysis. NIS gene expression in infected cells was functional and mediated uptake of radioiodide both in vitro and in vivo. Therapy experiments with both xenograft and immunocompetent Transgenic Adenocarcinoma of the Mouse Prostate (TRAMP) mouse models showed that the addition of radioiodide to VV-NIS-infected tumors was more effective than each single-agent therapy, restricting tumor growth and increasing survival. In conclusion, VV-NIS is effective in prostate cancer models. This treatment modality would be an attractive complement to existing clinical radiotherapy practice.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt20165"
"gt","Healthy and diseased corticospinal motor neurons are selectively transduced upon direct AAV2-2 injection into the motor cortex","Direct gene delivery to the neurons of interest, without affecting other neuron populations in the cerebral cortex, represent a challenge owing to the heterogeneity and cellular complexity of the brain. Genetic modulation of corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) is required for developing effective and long-term treatment strategies for motor neuron diseases, in which voluntary movement is impaired. Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) have been widely used for neuronal transduction studies owing to long-term and stable gene expression as well as low immunoreactivity in humans. Here we report that AAV2-2 transduces CSMN with high efficiency upon direct cortex injection and that transduction efficiencies are similar during presymptomatic and symptomatic stages in hSOD1G93A transgenic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mice. Our findings reveal that choice of promoter improves selectivity as AAV2-2 chicken β-actin promoter injection results in about 70% CSMN transduction, the highest percentage reported to date. CSMN transduction in both wild-type and transgenic ALS mice allows detailed analysis of single axon fibers within the corticospinal tract in both cervical and lumbar spinal cord and reveals circuitry defects, which mainly occur between CSMN and spinal motor neurons in hSOD1G93A transgenic ALS mice. Our findings set the stage for CSMN gene therapy in ALS and related motor neuron diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2015112"
"gt","Overexpression of a glucokinase point mutant in the treatment of diabetes mellitus","Glucokinase (GCK) is an important enzyme critical for glucose metabolism, and has been targeted as such in the pursuit of a cure for diabetes mellitus. We show that streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic murine model exhibits low GCK expression with high blood glucose levels; moreover, aggravated glomerulonephritis is observed in the model when there is IL10 deficiency. Although T cells infiltrate into the liver and pancreas in STZ-induced diabetes mice, T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 17 (Th17) cells decrease significantly with STZ addition in in vitro polarization. Using a mutant GCK gene (GCK 262) with a knocked out cytosine at position 2643 results in lower protein expression and more ubiquitination-led protein degradation compared with wild-type GCK (GCK 261). We further observed that hsa-mir-1302 can bind to 3′-untranslated region of mutant GCK, which can decrease GCK mRNA translation. Finally, delivery of mutant GCK by subcutaneous injection is more effective at decreasing blood glucose in the STZ-treated (STZ) murine diabetes model than insulin treatment alone. Similarly, mutant GCK consistently and moderately decreases blood glucose levels in GK rats over a period of 12 and 70 days without inducing hypoglycemia, whereas insulin is only effective over 12 h. These results suggest that mutant GCK may be a future cure for diabetes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt20161"
"gt","Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB confers enhanced neonatal intracranial transduction by AAV8 but not by 5, 9 or rh10","Sanfilippo syndrome type B (mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, MPS IIIB) is a lysosomal storage disease resulting from deficiency of N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAGLU) activity. To determine the possible therapeutic utility of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) in early gene therapy-based interventions, we performed a comprehensive assessment of transduction and biodistribution profiles of four central nervous system (CNS) administered rAAV serotypes, -5, -8, -9 and -rh10. To simulate optimal earliest treatment of the disease, each rAAV serotype was injected into the CNS of neonatal MPS IIIB and control animals. We observed marked differences in biodistribution and transduction profiles between the serotypes and this differed in MPS IIIB compared with healthy control mice. Overall, in control mice, all serotypes performed comparably, although some differences were observed in certain focal areas. In MPS IIIB mice, AAV8 was more efficient than AAV5, -9 and -rh10 for gene delivery to most structures analyzed, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and thalamus. Noteworthy, the pattern of biodistribution within the CNS varied by serotype and genotype. Interestingly, AAV8 also produced the highest green fluorescent protein intensity levels compared with any other serotype and demonstrated improved transduction in NAGLU compared with control brains. Importantly, we also show leakage of AAV8, -9 and -rh10, but not AAV5, from CNS parenchyma to systemic organs. Overall, our data suggest that AAV8 represents the best therapeutic gene transfer vector for early intervention in MPS IIIB.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2015111"

The potency and specificity of this system has been used to target dominantly inherited conditions caused by heterozygous missense mutations through inclusion of the mutated base in the short-guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence. This research evaluates a novel approach for targeting heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using CRISPR/Cas9. We determined that a mutation within KRT12, which causes Meesmann’s epithelial corneal dystrophy (MECD), leads to the occurrence of a novel protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). We designed an sgRNA complementary to the sequence adjacent to this SNP-derived PAM and evaluated its potency and allele specificity both in vitro and in vivo. This sgRNA was found to be highly effective at reducing the expression of mutant KRT12 mRNA and protein in vitro. To assess its activity in vivo we injected a combined Cas9/sgRNA expression construct into the corneal stroma of a humanized MECD mouse model. Sequence analysis of corneal genomic DNA revealed non-homologous end-joining repair resulting in frame-shifting deletions within the mutant KRT12 allele. This study is the first to demonstrate in vivo gene editing of a heterozygous disease-causing SNP that results in a novel PAM, further highlighting the potential for CRISPR/Cas9-based therapeutics.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201582"
"gt","Measurement of lentiviral vector titre and copy number by cross-species duplex quantitative PCR","Lentiviruses are the vectors of choice for many preclinical studies and clinical applications of gene therapy. Accurate measurement of biological vector titre before treatment is a prerequisite for vector dosing, and the calculation of vector integration sites per cell after treatment is as critical to the characterisation of modified cell products as it is to long-term follow-up and the assessment of risk and therapeutic efficiency in patients. These analyses are typically based on quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), but as yet compromise accuracy and comparability between laboratories and experimental systems, the former by using separate simplex reactions for the detection of endogene and lentiviral sequences and the latter by designing different PCR assays for analyses in human cells and animal disease models. In this study, we validate in human and murine cells a qPCR system for the single-tube assessment of lentiviral vector copy numbers that is suitable for analyses in at least 33 different mammalian species, including human and other primates, mouse, pig, cat and domestic ruminants. The established assay combines the accuracy of single-tube quantitation by duplex qPCR with the convenience of one-off assay optimisation for cross-species analyses and with the direct comparability of lentiviral transduction efficiencies in different species.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201560"

Secondary axonal loss is prominent in the progressive phase of this neuropathy. Neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) is an important autocrine factor supporting Schwann cell survival and differentiation and stimulates neurite outgrowth and myelination. The anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of NT-3 raised considerations of potential efficacy in the SAPP model that could be applicable to CIDP. For this study, scAAV1.tMCK.NT-3 was delivered to the gastrocnemius muscle of 25-week-old SAPP mice. Measurable NT-3 levels were found in the serum at 7-week postgene delivery. The outcome measures included functional, electrophysiological and histological assessments. At week 32, NT-3-treated mice showed increased hind limb grip strength that correlated with improved compound muscle action potential amplitude. Myelinated fiber density was 1.9 times higher in the NT-3-treated group compared with controls and the number of demyelinated axons was significantly lower. The remyelinated nerve fiber population was significantly increased. These improved histopathological parameters from scAAV1.tMCK.NT-3 treatment occurred in the setting of reduced sciatic nerve inflammation. Collectively, these findings suggest a translational application to CIDP.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201567"

Efficacy studies were hampered by difficulties in ConvDC manufacturing and low potency. Overcoming these issues, we demonstrated higher potency of lentiviral vector (LV)-programmed DCs. Monocytes were directly induced to self-differentiate into DCs (SmartDC-TRP2) upon transduction with a tricistronic LV encoding for cytokines (granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4)) and a melanoma antigen (tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP2)). Here, SmartDC-TRP2 generated with monocytes from five advanced melanoma patients were tested in autologous DC:T cell stimulation assays, validating the activation of functional TRP2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) for all patients. We described methods compliant to good manufacturing practices (GMP) to produce LV and SmartDC-TRP2. Feasibility of monocyte transduction in a bag system and cryopreservation following a 24-h standard operating procedure were achieved. After thawing, 50% of the initial monocyte input was recovered and SmartDC-TRP2 self-differentiated in vitro, showing uniform expression of DC markers, detectable LV copies and a polyclonal LV integration pattern not biased to oncogenic loci. GMP-grade SmartDC-TRP2 expanded TRP2-specific autologous CTLs in vitro. These results demonstrated a simpler GMP-compliant method of manufacturing an effective individualized DC vaccine. Such DC vaccine, when in combination with checkpoint inhibition therapies, might provide higher specificity against melanoma.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201543"

This study investigated the effects of RASSF1A expression restoration using a hypoxia-inducible CEA promoter-driven vector on xenograft tumor growth in nude mice and on the in-vitro regulation of gastric cancer cell viability, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, colony formation and invasion capacity. The data showed that the level of CEA mRNA and protein was much higher in gastric cancer SGC7901 cells than in a second gastric cancer cell line, MKN28, or in the MCF-10A normal epithelial breast cell line. RASSF1A expression was restored in SGC7901 cells compared with the negative control virus-infected SGC7910 cells. RASSF1A expression restoration significantly inhibited gastric cancer cell viability, colony formation and invasion capacity, but induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro, especially under hypoxic culture conditions. At the gene level, restoration of RASSF1A expression under hypoxic culture conditions significantly suppressed matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression and prevented cyclinD1 expression. A nude mouse xenograft assay showed that the restoration of RASSF1A expression reduced gastric cancer xenograft formation and growth. In conclusion, the restoration of RASSF1A expression using a hypoxia-inducible and CEA promoter-driven vector suppressed aggressive phenotypes of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that LV-5HRE-CEAp-RASSF1A gene therapy may be a promising novel approach to treat advanced gastric cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201549"

LEISHDNAVAX is a multi-antigen, T-cell epitope-enriched DNA vaccine candidate against human leishmaniasis. The vaccine candidate has been proven immunogenic and showed prophylactic efficacy in preclinical studies. Here, we describe the safety testing of LEISHDNAVAX in naive mice and rats, complemented by the demonstration of tolerability in Leishmania-infected mice. Biodistribution and persistence were examined following single and repeated intradermal (i.d.) administration to rats. DNA vectors were distributed systemically but did not accumulate upon repeated injections. Although vector DNA was cleared from most other tissues within 60 days after the last injection, it persisted in skin at the site of injection and in draining lymph nodes. Evaluation of single-dose and repeated-dose toxicity of the vaccine candidate after i.d. administration to naive, non-infected mice did not reveal any safety concerns. LEISHDNAVAX was also well tolerated in Leishmania-infected mice. Taken together, our results substantiate a favorable safety profile of LEISHDNAVAX in both naive and infected animals and thus, support the initiation of clinical trials for both preventive and therapeutic applications of the vaccine.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201535"

We have previously developed a therapeutic DNA vaccine encoding calreticulin (CRT) linked to E7, CRT/E7 DNA vaccine, for use in the treatment of HPV-associated lesions. Since the transfection efficiency of DNA vaccines administered in vivo is typically low, we examined the use of electroporation as well as different routes of administration to enhance antigen-specific tumor control. We tested the effects of the CRT/E7 DNA vaccine administered intramuscularly or intravaginally, with or without electroporation, on the generation of CD8+ T-cell immunity and therapeutic antitumor effects in HPV16 E7-expressing cervicovaginal tumor-bearing mice. We found that intravaginal vaccination of CRT/E7 DNA followed by electroporation-induced potent E7-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in the cervicovaginal tract, compared with intramuscular injection followed by electroporation. Furthermore, tumor-bearing mice vaccinated intravaginally followed by electroporation had an enhanced survival, antitumor effects and local production of IFN-γ+CD8+ T cells compared with those vaccinated intramuscularly with electroporation. Thus, we show that intravaginal CRT/E7 DNA vaccination followed by electroporation generates the most potent therapeutic antitumor effects against an orthotopic E7-expressing tumor model. The current study will have significant clinical implications once a clinically applicable electroporation device for intravaginal use becomes available.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201517"
"gt","Preferable sites and orientations of transgene inserted in the adenovirus vector genome: The E3 site may be unfavorable for transgene position","The adenovirus vector (AdV) can carry two transgenes in its genome, the therapeutic gene and a reporter gene, for example. The E3 insertion site has often been used for the expression of the second transgene. A transgene can be inserted at six different sites/orientations: E1, E3 and E4 sites, and right and left orientations. However, the best combination of the insertion sites and orientations as for the titers and the expression levels has not sufficiently been studied. We attempted to construct 18 AdVs producing GFP or LacZ gene driven by the EF1α promoter and Cre gene driven by the α-fetoprotein promoter. The AdV containing GFP gene at E3 in the rightward orientation (GFP-E3R) was not available. The LacZ-E3R AdV showed 20-fold lower titer and 50-fold lower level of fiber mRNA than the control E1L AdV. Notably, we found four aberrantly spliced mRNAs in the LacZ-E3L/R AdVs, probably explaining their very low titers. Although the transgene expression levels in the E4R AdVs were about threefold lower than those in the E1L AdVs, their titers are comparable with that of E1L AdVs. We concluded that E1L and E4R sites/orientations are preferable for expressing the main target gene and a second gene, respectively.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2014124"

Application of pEEVGmCSF-b7.1 led to complete tumour regression in 66% of CT26-treated tumours and 100% in the B16F10-treated tumours at day 150 post-treatment. pEEVGmCSF-b7.1 treatment was found to significantly enhance levels of both innate and adaptive immune populations in tumour and systemic sites, which corresponded to significantly increased tissue levels of proinflammatory cytokines including interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and interleukin-12 (IL-12). In contrast, pEEVGmCSF-b7.1 treatment significantly reduced the T-regulatory populations and also the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Upon further characterisation of functional immune responses, we observed a significant increase in cytotoxic (CD107a+) and IFN-γ-producing natural killer cells and also significantly more in IL-12-producing B cells. Importantly, splenocytes isolated from pEEVGmCSF-b7.1-treated ‘cured’ mice were tumour-specific and afforded significant protection in a tumour rechallenge model (Winn assay). Our data indicate that electroimmunogene therapy with the non-viral pEEVGmCSF-b7.1 is able to induce potent and durable antitumour immune responses that significantly reduce primary and also secondary tumour growth, and thus represents a solid therapeutic platform for pursuing future clinical trials.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201495"
"gt","Intramuscular delivery of heterodimeric IL-15 DNA in macaques produces systemic levels of bioactive cytokine inducing proliferation of NK and T cells","Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a common γ-chain cytokine that has a significant role in the activation and proliferation of T and NK cells and holds great potential in fighting infection and cancer. We have previously shown that bioactive IL-15 in vivo comprises a complex of the IL-15 chain with the soluble or cell-associated IL-15 receptor alpha (IL-15Rα) chain, which together form the IL-15 heterodimer. We have generated DNA vectors expressing the heterodimeric IL-15 by optimizing mRNA expression and protein trafficking. Repeated administration of these DNA plasmids by intramuscular injection followed by in vivo electroporation in rhesus macaques resulted in sustained high levels of IL-15 in plasma, with no significant toxicity. Administration of DNAs expressing heterodimeric IL-15 also resulted in an increased frequency of NK and T cells undergoing proliferation in peripheral blood. Heterodimeric IL-15 led to preferential expansion of CD8+NK cells, all memory CD8+ T-cell subsets and effector memory CD4+ T cells. Expression of heterodimeric IL-15 by DNA delivery to the muscle is an efficient procedure to obtain high systemic levels of bioactive cytokine, without the toxicity linked to the high transient cytokine peak associated with protein injection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201484"
"gt","A dystrophic muscle broadens the contribution and activation of immune cells reacting to rAAV gene transfer","Recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAVs) are used for therapeutic gene transfer in skeletal muscle, but it is unclear if immune reactivity to gene transfer and persistence of transgene are affected by pathologic conditions such as muscular dystrophy. Thus, we compared dystrophic mice devoid of α-sarcoglycan with healthy mice to characterize immune cell activation and cellular populations contributing to the loss of gene-modified myofibers. Following rAAV2/1 delivery of an immunogenic α-sarcoglycan reporter transgene in the muscle, both strains developed strong CD4 and CD8 T-cell-mediated immune responses in lymphoid organs associated with muscle CD3+ T and CD11b+ mononuclear cell infiltrates. Selective cell subset depletion models revealed that CD4+ T cells were essential for transgene rejection in both healthy and pathologic mice, but macrophages and CD8+ T cells additionally contributed as effector cells of transgene rejection only in dystrophic mice. Vectors restricting transgene expression in antigen-presenting cells showed that endogenous presentation of transgene products was the sole mechanism responsible for T-cell priming in normal mice, whereas additional and protracted antigenic presentation occurred in dystrophic animals, leading to secondary CD4+ T-cell activation and failure to maintain transgene expression. Therefore, the dystrophic environment diversifies cellular immune response mechanisms induced by gene transfer, with a negative outcome.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201461"

An efficient and safe delivery system is indispensable when shRNA is delivered into living organisms for gene therapy. Previous studies have proved that DNA and protein can be delivered into dendritic cells (DCs) by non-pathogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae without being degraded. CD40 is closely related to apoptosis of tumor cells and some immune mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrated that recombinant yeast S. cerevisiae efficiently delivered the shRNA of immune-associated gene (CD40) into mouse intestinal DCs via oral administration. Western blot analysis of isolated intestinal DCs indicated that the inhibition of CD40 gene expression reached up to 56–91%. The secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ in intestinal DCs had varying degrees of changes. In conclusion, we found that orally administered recombinant yeast can be used as an efficient shRNA delivery system for intestinal DC-specific gene silencing and immunomodulation in vivo.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201450"

Wild-type and synthetic codon optimized (co) NS3/4A DNA vaccines have previously been shown to be immunogenic in mice, rabbits and humans, although we have very poor knowledge about the longevity of the immune responses primed. We therefore analyzed the functionality of primed NS3/4A-specific immune responses in BALB/c (H-2d) and/or C57BL/6J (H-2b) mice 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 and 16 months after the last immunization. Mice were immunized one, two, three or four times using gene gun delivery to the skin or by intramuscular administration. Immunological responses after immunization were monitored by protection against in vivo challenge of NS3/4A-expressing syngeneic tumor cells. In addition, functionality of the NS3/4A-specific T cells was analyzed by a standard cytotoxicity assay. First, we identified a new unique murine H-2d-restricted NS3/4A cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope, which enabled us to study the epitope-specific immune responses. Our results show that the coNS3/4A vaccine was highly immunogenic by determination of interferon-γ/tumor necrosis factor-α production and lytic cytotoxic T cells, which could efficiently inhibit in vivo tumor growth. Importantly, we showed that one to four monthly immunizations protected mice from tumor development when challenged up to 16 months after the last immunization. When determining the functionality of NS3/4A-specific T cells in vitro, we showed detectable lytic activity up to 12 months after the last immunization. Thus, NS3/4A-based DNA vaccines activate potent cellular immune responses that are present and function in both BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice up to 12–16 months after the last immunization. The induction of long-term immunity after NS3/4A DNA immunization has not been shown previously and supports the use of NS3/4A in hepatitis C virus vaccine compositions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201448"

However, after systemic injection, the neurotropism of the vector has been reported to vary according to age at injection, with greater neuronal transduction in newborns and preferential glial cell tropism in adults. This difference has not yet been reported after cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) delivery. The present study analyzed both neuronal and glial cell transduction in the CNS of cats according to age of AAV9 CSF injection. In both newborns and young cats, administration of AAV9-GFP in the cisterna magna resulted in high levels of motor neurons (MNs) transduction from the cervical (84±5%) to the lumbar (99±1%) spinal cord, demonstrating that the remarkable tropism of AAV9 for MNs is not affected by age at CSF delivery. Surprisingly, numerous oligodendrocytes were also transduced in the brain and in the spinal cord white matter of young cats, but not of neonates, indicating that (i) age of CSF delivery influences the tropism of AAV9 for glial cells and (ii) AAV9 intracisternal delivery could be relevant for both the treatment of MN and demyelinating disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201416"

DLC1 is a hot spot for phiC31 integrase-mediated transgene integration in vitro and in vivo. Here we show that integration of a coagulation factor VIII transgene into intron 7 of DLC1 supports durable expression of factor VIII in primary human umbilical cord-lining epithelial cells. Oligoclonal cells with factor VIII transgene integrated in DLC1 did not have altered expression of DLC1 or neighbouring genes within a 1-Mb interval. Only 1.9% of all expressed genes were transcriptionally altered; most were downregulated and mapped to cell cycle and DNA repair pathways. DLC1-integrated cells were not tumourigenic in vivo and were normal by high-resolution genomic DNA copy number analysis. Our data identify DLC1 as a locus for durable transgene expression that does not incur features of insertional oncogenesis, thus expanding options for developing ex vivo cell therapy mediated by site-specific integration methods.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201411"

An efficient macrophage-specific promoter is required for the targeting to macrophages. In this study, we develop a macrophage-specific synthetic promoter for the therapeutic application of adiponectin (APN), an antiatherogenic gene. Synthetic promoter-146 (SP146), registered on the NCBI website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/DQ107383), was tested for promoter activities in two non-macrophage cell lines (293 T, HeLa) and a macrophage cell line (RAW264.7, bone marrow-derived macrophages). To enforce macrophage specificity, partial elements of p47phox including the PU.1 site with various lengths (-C1, -C2 and -C3) were inserted next to the synthetic promoters. SP146-C1 showed the highest specificity and efficacy in RAW264.7 cells and was selected for development of an APN-carrying macrophage-specific promoter. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)- or APN-expressing lentivirus under SP146-C1 (Lenti-SP-GFP or Lenti-SP-APN, respectively) showed the highest expression efficacy in RAW264.7 cells compared with the non-macrophage cell lines. APN overexpression in RAW264.7 cells successfully inhibited intracellular lipid accumulation, and atherosclerotic lesions and lipid accumulation were significantly reduced by Lenti-SP-APN in ApoE−/− atherosclerosis mice. In conclusion, the synthetic promoter SP146-C1, combined with a p47phox promoter element, was successfully developed to target macrophage, and macrophage-specific introduction of APN under SP146-C1 was shown to ameliorate the atherosclerotic pathology.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt20143"

Rodent administration of CBD3 conjugated to cell penetrating motif TAT (TAT-CBD3) has been shown to reduce pain behavior in inflammatory and neuropathic pain models. However, TAT-CBD3 analgesia has limitations, including short half-life, lack of cellular specificity and undesired potential off-site effects. We hypothesized that these issues could be addressed by expressing CBD3 encoded by high-expression vectors in primary sensory neurons. We constructed an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector expressing recombinant fluorescent CBD3 peptide and injected it into lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) of rats before spared nerve injury (SNI). We show that selective expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-CBD3 in lumbar 4 (L4) and L5 DRG neurons and their axonal projections results in effective attenuation of nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain in the SNI model. We conclude that AAV-encoded CBD3 delivered to peripheral sensory neurons through DRG injection may be a valuable approach for exploring the role of presynaptic VGCCs and long-term modulation of neurotransmission, and may also be considered for development as a gene therapy strategy to treat chronic neuropathic pain.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201356"

Previously, we have shown that embedding small interfering RNA sequences targeting apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB) in shRNA (shApoB) or miRNA (miApoB) scaffolds resulted in differential processing and long-term efficacy in vivo. Here we show that adeno-associated virus (AAV)-shApoB- or AAV-miApoB-mediated ApoB knockdown induced differential liver morphology and transcriptome expression changes. Our analyses indicate that ApoB knockdown with both shApoB and miApoB resulted in alterations of genes involved in lipid metabolism. In addition, in AAV-shApoB-injected animals, genes involved in immune system activation or cell growth and death were affected, which was associated with increased hepatocyte proliferation. Subsequently, in AAV-miApoB-injected animals, changes of genes involved in oxidoreductase activity, oxidative phosphorylation and nucleic bases biosynthetic processes were observed. Our results demonstrate that long-term knockdown of ApoB in vivo by shApoB or miApoB induces several transcriptome changes in murine liver. The increased hepatocyte profileration by AAV-shRNA may have severe long-term effects indicating that AAV-mediated RNA interference therapy using artificial miRNA may be a safer approach for familial hypercholesterolemia therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201358"

In contrast to nonhuman primate models, naturally occurring canine CNS diseases are common. In contrast to murine models, the dog’s lifespan is long, its brain is large and the diseases affecting it commonly have the same molecular, pathological and clinical phenotype as the human diseases. We compared the ability of four intracerebrally injected adeno-associated virus vector (AAV) serotypes to transduce the dog brain with green fluorescent protein as the first step in using these vectors to evaluate both delivery and efficacy in naturally occurring canine homologs of human diseases. Quantitative measures of transduction, maximum diameter and area, identified both AAV2/9 and AAV2/rh10 as significantly more efficient than either AAV2/1 or AAV2/5 at transducing cerebral cortex, caudate nucleus, thalamus and internal capsule. Fluorescence co-labeling with cell-type-specific antibodies demonstrated that AAV2/9 and AAV2/rh10 were capable of primarily transducing neurons, although glial transduction was also identified and found to be more efficient with the AAV2/9 vector. These data are a prerequisite to evaluating the efficacy of recombinant AAV vectors carrying disease-modifying transgenes to treat naturally occurring canine models in preclinical studies of human CNS disease therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201354"

However, because of the high molecular weight and negative charge of siRNA, it is restricted from crossing the blood–cochlear barrier, which limits the concentration and size of molecules that are able to gain access to cells of the inner ear. Intratympanic approaches, which deliver siRNA to the middle ear, rely on permeation through the round window for access to the structures of the inner ear. We developed an innovative siRNA delivery recombination protein, TAT double-stranded RNA-binding domains (TAT-DRBDs), which can transfect Cy3-labeled siRNA into cells of the inner ear, including the inner and outer hair cells, crista ampullaris, macula utriculi and macula sacculi, through intact round-window permeation in the chinchilla in vivo, and there were no apparent morphological damages for the time of observation. We also found that Cy3-labeled siRNA could directly enter spiral ganglion neurons and the epithelium of the stria vascularis independently; however, the mechanism is unknown. Therefore, as a non-viral vector, TAT-DRBD is a good candidate for the delivery of double-stranded siRNAs for treating various inner ear ailments and preservation of hearing function.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201349"

The most successful preclinical strategies to date have utilised vectors based on the species C adenovirus, Ad5, which engages the Coxsackie and Adenovirus receptor (CAR) as its primary attachment receptor. Profiling receptors on human SMCs demonstrated the absence of CAR but substantial expression of the species B receptor CD46. We performed transduction experiments using Ad5 and the CD46-utilising adenovirus Ad35, and found Ad35 significantly more efficient at transducing SMCs. To evaluate whether transduction could be further augmented, we evaluated chimeric CD46-utilising Ad5/Ad35 vectors comprising the Ad5 capsid pseudotyped with the Ad35 fibre alone (Ad5/F35) or in combination with the Ad35 penton (Ad5/F35/P35). In human smooth muscle cells (hSMCs), Ad5/F35/P35 mediated significantly higher levels of transduction than either parental vector or Ad5/F35. Ex vivo transduction experiments using mouse aortas from CD46 transgenics demonstrated that Ad5/F35/P35 was significantly more efficient at transducing SMCs than the other vectors tested. Finally, ex vivo transduction and immunofluorescent colocalisation experiments using human tissue from CABG procedures confirmed the preclinical potential of Ad5/F35/P35 as an efficient vector for vascular transduction during CABG.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201344"
"gt","Role of antigen-specific regulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells in tolerance induction after neonatal IP administration of AAV-hF.IX","Neonatal AAV8-mediated Factor IX (F.IX) gene delivery was applied as a model for exploring mechanisms of tolerance induction during immune ontogeny. Intraperitoneal delivery of AAV8/ Factor IX (hF.IX) during weeks 1–4 of life, over a 20-fold dose range, directed stable hF.IX expression, correction of coagulopathy in F.IX-null hemophilia B mice, and induction of tolerance to hF.IX; however, only primary injection at 1–2 days of life enabled increasing AAV8-mediated hF.IX expression after re-administration, due to the absence of anti-viral capsid antibodies. Adoptive splenocyte transfer from tolerized mice demonstrated induction of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory (Treg) populations that specifically suppressed anti-hF.IX antibody responses, but not responses to third party antigen. Induction of hF.IX antibodies was only observed in tolerized mice after in vivo CD4+CD25+ cell depletion and hF.IX challenge. Thus, primary injection of AAV during a critical period in the first week of life does not elicit antiviral responses, enabling re-administration of AAV and augmentation of hF.IX levels. Expansion of hF.IX-specific CD4+CD25+ Tregs has a major role in tolerance induction early in immune ontogeny. Neonatal gene transfer provides a useful approach for defining the ontogeny of immune responses and may suggest approaches for inducing tolerance in the context of genetic therapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201322"

The objective of this study is to evaluate whether selective HDL-raising gene transfer exerts cardioprotective effects post MI. Gene transfer in C57BL/6 low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr)−/− mice was performed with the E1E3E4-deleted adenoviral vector AdA-I, inducing hepatocyte-specific expression of human apo A-I, or with the control vector Adnull. A ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery was performed 2 weeks after transfer or saline injection. HDL cholesterol levels were persistently 1.5-times (P<0.0001) higher in AdA-I mice compared with controls. Survival was increased (P<0.01) in AdA-I MI mice compared with control MI mice during the 28-day follow-up period (hazard ratio for mortality 0.42; 95% confidence interval 0.24–0.76). Longitudinal morphometric analysis demonstrated attenuated infarct expansion and inhibition of left ventricular (LV) dilatation in AdA-I MI mice compared with controls. AdA-I transfer exerted immunomodulatory effects and increased neovascularisation in the infarct zone. Increased HDL after AdA-I transfer significantly improved systolic and diastolic cardiac function post MI, and led to a preservation of peripheral blood pressure. In conclusion, selective HDL-raising gene transfer may impede the development of heart failure.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201330"
"gt","Effect of vascular endothelial growth factor gene therapy on post-traumatic peripheral nerve regeneration and denervation-related muscle atrophy","Functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury depends on both improvement of nerve regeneration and prevention of denervation-related skeletal muscle atrophy. To reach these goals, in this study we overexpressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by means of local gene transfer with adeno-associated virus (AAV). Local gene transfer in the regenerating peripheral nerve was obtained by reconstructing a 1-cm-long rat median nerve defect using a vein segment filled with skeletal muscle fibers that have been previously injected with either AAV2-VEGF or AAV2-LacZ, and the morphofunctional outcome of nerve regeneration was assessed 3 months after surgery. Surprisingly, results showed that overexpression of VEGF in the muscle-vein-combined guide led to a worse nerve regeneration in comparison with AAV-LacZ controls. Local gene transfer in the denervated muscle was obtained by direct injection of either AAV2-VEGF or AAV2-LacZ in the flexor digitorum sublimis muscle after median nerve transection and results showed a significantly lower progression of muscle atrophy in AAV2-VEGF-treated muscles in comparison with muscles treated with AAV2-LacZ. Altogether, our results suggest that local delivery of VEGF by AAV2-VEGF-injected transplanted muscle fibers do not represent a rational approach to promote axonal regeneration along a venous nerve guide. By contrast, AAV2-VEGF direct local injection in denervated skeletal muscle significantly attenuates denervation-related atrophy, thus representing a promising strategy for improving the outcome of post-traumatic neuromuscular recovery after nerve injury and repair.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201326"
"gt","Inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia in a rabbit vein graft model following non-viral transfection with human iNOS cDNA","Vein graft failure caused by neointimal hyperplasia (IH) after coronary artery bypass grafting with saphenous veins is a major clinical problem. The lack of safe and efficient vectors for vascular gene transfer has significantly hindered progress in this field. We have developed a Receptor-Targeted Nanocomplex (RTN) vector system for this purpose and assessed its therapeutic efficacy in a rabbit vein graft model of bypass grafting. Adventitial delivery of β-Galactosidase showed widespread transfection throughout the vein wall on day 7, estimated at about 10% of cells in the adventitia and media. Vein grafts were then transfected with a plasmid encoding inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and engrafted into the carotid artery. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry analysis of samples from rabbits killed at 7 days after surgery showed that mostly endothelial cells and macrophages were transfected. Morphometric analysis of vein graft samples from the 28-day groups showed approximately a 50% reduction of neointimal thickness and 64% reduction of neointimal area in the iNOS-treated group compared with the surgery control groups. This study demonstrates efficacy of iNOS gene delivery by the RTN formulation in reducing IH in the rabbit model of vein graft disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201320"
"gt","Prevalence and pharmacological modulation of humoral immunity to AAV vectors in gene transfer to synovial tissue","Antibodies against adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors are highly prevalent in humans. Both preclinical and clinical studies showed that antibodies against AAV block transduction even at low titers, particularly when the vector is introduced into the bloodstream. Here we measured the neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer against AAV serotypes 2, 5, 6 and 8 in the serum and matched synovial fluid (SF) from rheumatoid arthritis patients. The titer in the SF was lower than that in the matched plasma samples, indicating a difference in distribution of NAb to AAV depending on the body fluid compartment. This difference was more evident for AAV2, against which higher titers were measured. Of all serotypes, anti-AAV5 antibodies were the least prevalent in both the serum and SF. We next evaluated the impact of B-cell depletion on anti-AAV antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis patients who received one or two courses of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab as part of their disease management. A drop of NAb titer was observed in a subset of those subjects carrying NAb titers ⩽1:1000; however, only in a minority of subjects titers dropped below 1:5. This work provides insights into strategies to overcome the limitation of pre-existing humoral immunity to AAV vectors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201255"
"gt","Modulating vascular intimal hyperplasia using HSV-1 mutant requires activated MEK","Outcomes of cardiovascular procedures, such as angioplasty and stent or bypass grafting are limited by failure, predominantly caused by pathological smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, known as intimal hyperplasia. Local delivery of a genetically engineered herpes simplex virus (HSV) is known to block vascular SMC proliferation while allowing for re-endothelialization. However, the mechanism this mutant virus uses to prevent SMC hyperplasia is unknown. The Ras signaling cascade is activated in SMCs undergoing hyperplasia leading to phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). In this study we tested the hypothesis that MAPK kinase (MEK) activity is the molecular basis by which SMCs are susceptible to mutant HSV. We show that genetically engineered herpes simplex-1 viruses (HSV-1) can target proliferating SMCs. We demonstrate that the molecular basis of this HSV-1 anti-proliferative effect is MEK activation in SMCs. We demonstrate efficacy and practicality of the MEK-dependent HSV-1 for the treatment of intimal hyperplasia in a clinically relevant in vivo model. Important to this strategy is the ability to modulate the effects by controlling viral dose. These results propel genetically engineered HSV-1 therapy towards clinical evaluation in treatment of intimal hyperplasia.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201226"
"gt","AAV-based shRNA silencing of NF-κB ameliorates muscle pathologies in mdx mice","Chronic inflammation, promoted by an upregulated NF-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway, has a key role in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients’ pathogenesis. Blocking the NF-κB pathway has been shown to be a viable approach to diminish chronic inflammation and necrosis in the dystrophin-defective mdx mouse, a murine DMD model. In this study, we used the recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) carrying an short hairpin RNA (shRNA) specifically targeting the messenger RNA of NF-κB/p65 (p65-shRNA), the major subunit of NF-κB associated with chronic inflammation in mdx mice. We examined whether i.m. AAV9-mediated delivery of p65-shRNA could decrease NF-κB activation, allowing for amelioration of muscle pathologies in 1- and 4-month-old mdx mice. At 1 month after treatment, NF-κB/p65 levels were significantly decreased by AAV gene transfer of p65-shRNA in the two ages of treatment groups, with necrosis significantly decreased compared with controls. Quantitative analysis revealed that central nucleation (CN) of the myofibers of p65-shRNA-treated 1-month-old mdx muscles was reduced from 67 to 34%, but the level of CN was not significantly decreased in treated 4-month-old mdx mice. Moreover, delivery of the p65-shRNA enhanced the capacity of myofiber regeneration in old mdx mice treated at 4 months of age when the dystrophic myofibers were most exhausted; however, such p65 silencing diminished the myofiber regeneration in young mdx mice treated at 1 month of age. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the AAV-mediated delivery of p65-shRNA has the capacity to ameliorate muscle pathologies in mdx mice by selectively reducing NF-κB/p65 activity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2011207"

Engineering LVs to specifically transduce APCs is required to promote their translation towards the clinic. We report on the Nanobody (Nb) display technology to target LVs to dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages. This innovative approach exploits the budding mechanism of LVs to incorporate an APC-specific Nb and a binding-defective, fusion-competent form of VSV.G in the viral envelope. In addition to production of high titer LVs, we demonstrated selective, Nb-dependent transduction of mouse DCs and macrophages both in vitro and in situ. Moreover, this strategy was translated to a human model in which selective transduction of in vitro generated or lymph node (LN)-derived DCs and macrophages, was demonstrated. In conclusion, the Nb display technology is an attractive approach to generate LVs targeted to specific cell types.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2011206"
"gt","Bacterial magnetic particles as a novel and efficient gene vaccine delivery system","DNA vaccination is an attractive approach for eliciting antigen-specific immunity. In this study, we used magnetosomes (bacterial magnetic particles, BMPs) as carriers of a recombinant DNA composed of a secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine, human papillomavirus type E7 (HPV-E7) and Ig-Fc fragment (pSLC-E7-Fc) to generate a gene vaccine (BMP-V) for tumour immunotherapy. The results indicate that BMPs linked to DNA more efficiently in phosphate-buffered saline (pH=4–5) than in physiological saline. Efficient transfection of BMP-V in vitro and in vivo was achieved when a 600-mT static magnetic field was applied for 10 min. In a mouse tumour model, subcutaneous injection of BMP-V (5 μg, × 3 at 4-day intervals) plus magnetic exposure elicited systemic HPV-E7-specific immunity leading to significant tumour inhibition. The treated mice tolerated BMP-V immunisation well with no toxic side effects, as shown by histopathological examinations of major internal organs. Taken together, these results suggest that BMP can be used as a gene carrier to elicit a systemic immune response.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2011197"
"gt","Cross-presentation of tumour antigens by human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived CD141+XCR1+ dendritic cells","Monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC) have been widely used in cancer immunotherapy but show significant donor-to-donor variability and low capacity for the cross-presentation of tumour-associated antigens (TAA) to CD8+ T cells, greatly limiting the success of this approach. Given recent developments in induced pluripotency and the relative ease with which induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell lines may be generated from individuals, we have succeeded in differentiating dendritic cells (DC) from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201+ iPS cells (iPS cell-derived DC (ipDC)), using protocols compliant with their subsequent clinical application. Unlike moDC, a subset of ipDC was found to coexpress CD141 and XCR1 that have been shown previously to define the human equivalent of mouse CD8α+ DC, in which the capacity for cross-presentation has been shown to reside. Accordingly, ipDC were able to cross-present the TAA, Melan A, to a CD8+ T-cell clone and stimulate primary Melan A-specific responses among naïve T cells from an HLA-A*0201+ donor. Given that CD141+XCR1+ DC are present in peripheral blood in trace numbers that preclude their clinical application, the ability to generate a potentially unlimited source from iPS cells offers the possibility of harnessing their capacity for cross-priming of cytotoxic T lymphocytes for the induction of tumour-specific immune responses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2011177"
"gt","Low-density lipoprotein receptor gene transfer in hypercholesterolemic mice improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction","Left ventricular (LV) function post-myocardial infarction (MI) is adversely influenced by hypercholesterolemia independent of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether lipid lowering by adenoviral low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (AdLDLr) gene transfer in C57BL/6 LDL receptor (LDLr)-deficient mice beneficially affects ventricular remodeling and cardiac function post-MI independent of effects on the coronary circulation. AdLDLr transfer reduced plasma cholesterol by 77% (P<0.0001). Survival 28 days post-MI was higher in AdLDLr-treated mice (95%) compared with control mice (80%) (P<0.05) (hazard ratio for mortality 0.26, 95% confidence interval 0.11–0.84). Infarct size was not significantly different at day 1 and day 7 but was reduced by 18% (P<0.05) at day 28 in AdLDLr MI mice compared with control MI mice. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis were reduced and neovascularization was increased in AdLDLr MI mice. LDLr gene transfer had beneficial effects on endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) number and ex vivo EPC function. LV contractility and relaxation were better preserved in AdLDLr MI mice compared with control MI mice. In conclusion, lipid lowering in hypercholesterolemic mice exerts direct cardioprotective effects resulting in enhanced survival, reduced infarct size, decreased ventricular remodeling and better cardiac function.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2011147"
"gt","Tumor vasculature is a key determinant for the efficiency of nanoparticle-mediated siRNA delivery","Delivering small interfering RNA (siRNA) to tumors using clinically viable formulations remains the primary technical hurdle that prevents the development of siRNA therapy for cancer treatment. Over the past several years, significant effort has been devoted to explore novel delivery strategies, whereas relatively little attention has been paid to understand the impact of physiological constrains such as tumor vasculature on the efficiency of siRNA delivery. Using the previously described positive-readout tumor models where successful siRNA delivery leads to an upregulation of β-galactosidase within tumor sections, we analyzed the spatial distribution of localized target knockdown within tumor sections relative to tumor hypoxia and found that stable nucleic acid lipid particle (SNALP), a lipid nanoparticle-based delivery system, predominantly delivers siRNA to areas adjacent to functional tumor blood vessels. Increasing tumor vascularity by ectopic expression of VEGF resulted in more efficient siRNA delivery to tumors using SNALP. SNALP-mediated delivery of a siRNA-targeting Ran GTPase led to target knockdown and significant antitumor efficacy in the highly vascularized HepG2-derived liver tumors, but not in the poorly vascularized HCT-116-derived liver tumors. These results highlight the significant impact of tumor vasculature on siRNA delivery and call for a more focused effort on addressing tumor penetration after extravasation, an area of only limited attention currently.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2011146"
"gt","Radioiodine therapy of thyroid carcinoma following Pax-8 gene transfer","The thyroid transcription factor Pax-8 could bind with the promoter/enhancer of thyroid-specific genes such as thyroglobulin (Tg), thyroperoxidase (TPO) and sodium iodide symporter (NIS), and regulate the expression of these proteins in thyrocyte. Promoting iodide accumulation in tumor cells by re-expression of Pax-8 provides a possible strategy for radioiodine therapy of tumor. Therefore, we investigated the effect of Pax-8 gene transfer on radioiodine therapy of thyroid carcinoma. The human Pax-8 gene was transfected into the human thyroid carcinoma (K1 and F133) cells by the recombinant adenovirus vector. Although the NIS mRNA was not detected, the expression of mRNA and proteins of Tg and TPO in AdPax-8-infected F133 cells were activated by Pax-8. Iodide uptake in thyroid carcinoma cells was reactivated by Pax-8 (increasing 3.3-fold in K1 cells and 5.7-fold in F133 cells). Moreover, Pax-8 promoted iodide organification and the retention time of iodine in Pax-8-expressing cells apparently prolonged in vitro and in vivo (P<0.05). Pax-8-expressing thyroid carcinoma cells were selectively killed by radioiodine. The AdPax-8-infected tumors in vivo clearly visualized in scanning images at 12 h after administration of radioiodine. These results indicate that Pax-8 can promote iodide uptake, and specifically prolong the retention time of iodide in thyroid cancer in vitro and in vivo by promoting the expression of TPO and Tg proteins. Pax-8 gene transfection may lead to effective radioiodine therapy of tumor.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2011110"
"gt","Muscle gene electrotransfer is increased by the antioxidant tempol in mice","Electropermeabilization (EP) is an effective method of gene transfer into different tissues. During EP, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed, which could affect transfection efficiency. The role of generated ROS and the role of antioxidants in electrotransfer in myoblasts in vitro and in Musculus tibialis cranialis in mice were, therefore, investigated. We demonstrate in the study that during EP of C2C12 myoblasts, ROS are generated on the surface of the cells, which do not induce long-term genomic DNA damage. Plasmid DNA for transfection (pEGFP-N1), which is present outside the cells during EP, neutralizes the generated ROS. The ROS generation is proportional to the amplitude of the electric pulses and can be scavenged by antioxidants, such as vitamin C or tempol. When antioxidants were used during gene electrotransfer, the transfection efficiency of C2C12 myoblasts was statistically significantly increased 1.6-fold with tempol. Also in vivo, the transfection efficiency of M. tibialis cranialis in mice was statistically significantly increased 1.4-fold by tempol. The study indicates that ROS are generated on cells during EP and can be scavenged by antioxidants. Specifically, tempol can be used to improve gene electrotransfer into the muscle and possibly also to other tissues.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201197"

DNA shearing strongly correlated with length. Typical sized plasmids (⩾3000 bp) degraded rapidly. DNAs 2000–3000 bp persisted ∼10 min. Even in the absence of condensing agents, supercoiled DNA <1200 bp survived nebulization, and increased forces of sonication were necessary to shear it. Circular vectors were considerably more resistant to shearing than linear vectors of the same length. DNA supercoiling afforded additional protection. These results show the potential of shear-resistant Minivector DNAs to overcome one of the major challenges associated with gene therapy delivery.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201177"
"gt","AAV-mediated in vivo knockdown of luciferase using combinatorial RNAi and U1i","RNA interference (RNAi) has been successfully employed for specific inhibition of gene expression; however, safety and delivery of RNAi remain critical issues. We investigated the combinatorial use of RNAi and U1 interference (U1i). U1i is a gene-silencing technique that acts on the pre-mRNA by preventing polyadenylation. RNAi and U1i have distinct mechanisms of action in different cellular compartments and their combined effect allows usage of minimal doses, thereby avoiding toxicity while retaining high target inhibition. As a proof of concept, we investigated knockdown of the firefly luciferase reporter gene by combinatorial use of RNAi and U1i, and evaluated their inhibitory potential both in vitro and in vivo. Co-transfection of RNAi and U1i constructs showed additive reduction of luciferase expression up to 95% in vitro. We attained similar knockdown when RNAi and U1i constructs were hydrodynamically transfected into murine liver, demonstrating for the first time successful in vivo application of U1i. Moreover, we demonstrated long-term gene silencing by AAV-mediated transduction of murine muscle with RNAi/U1i constructs targeting firefly luciferase. In conclusion, these results provide a proof of principle for the combinatorial use of RNAi and U1i to enhance target gene knockdown in vivo.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201141"

We hypothesized that non-viral gene transfer of naked plasmid DNA-expressing hSDF-1 could similarly improve cardiac function. To optimize plasmid delivery, we tested SDF-1 and luciferase plasmids driven by the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter with (pCMVe) or without (pCMV) translational enhancers or α myosin heavy chain (pMHC) promoter in a rodent model of heart failure. In vivo expression of pCMVe was 10-fold greater than pCMV and pMHC expression and continued over 30 days. We directly injected rat hearts with SDF-1 plasmid 1 month after MI and assessed heart function. At 4 weeks after plasmid injection, we observed a 35.97 and 32.65% decline in fractional shortening (FS) in control (saline) animals and pMHC-hSDF1 animals, respectively, which was sustained to 8 weeks. In contrast, we observed a significant 24.97% increase in animals injected with the pCMVe-hSDF1 vector. Immunohistochemistry of cardiac tissue revealed a significant increase in vessel density in the hSDF-1-treated animals compared with control animals. Increasing SDF-1 expression promoted angiogenesis and improved cardiac function in rats with ischemic heart failure along with evidence of scar remodeling with a trend toward decreased myocardial fibrosis. These data demonstrate that stand-alone non-viral hSDF-1 gene transfer is a strategy for improving cardiac function in ischemic cardiomyopathy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201118"

Interleukin (IL)-12 induces a potent antitumor effect by promoting natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic T cell activities. IL-18 also augments cytotoxicity of NK cells and proliferation of T cells. This effect further enhances the function of IL-12 in a synergistic manner. Therefore, we investigated for the first time an effective cancer immunogene therapy of syngeneic tumors via intratumoral administration of oncolytic Ad co-expressing IL-12 and IL-18, RdB/IL-12/IL-18. Intratumoral administration of RdB/IL-12/IL-18 improved antitumor effects, as well as increased survival, in B16-F10 murine melanoma model. The ratio of T-helper type 1/2 cytokine as well as the levels of IL-12, IL-18, interferon-γ and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor was markedly elevated in RdB/IL-12/IL-18-treated tumors. Mice injected with RdB/IL-12/IL-18 also showed enhanced cytotoxicity of tumor-specific immune cells. Consistent with these results, immense necrosis and infiltration of NK cells, as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, were observed in RdB/IL-12/IL-18-treated tumor tissues. Importantly, tumors treated with RdB/IL-12/IL-18 showed an elevated number of T cells expressing IL-12Rβ2 or IL-18Rα. These results provide a new insight into therapeutic mechanisms of IL-12 plus IL-18 and provide a potential clinical cancer immunotherapeutic agent for improved antitumor immunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201137"
"gt","AAV-mediated photoreceptor transduction of the pig cone-enriched retina","Recent success in clinical trials supports the use of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors for gene therapy of retinal diseases caused by defects in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In contrast, evidence of the efficacy of AAV-mediated gene transfer to retinal photoreceptors, the major site of inherited retinal diseases, is less robust. In addition, although AAV-mediated RPE transduction appears efficient, independently of the serotype used and species treated, AAV-mediated photoreceptor gene transfer has not been systematically investigated thus so far in large animal models, which also may allow identifying relevant species-specific differences in AAV-mediated retinal transduction. In the present study, we used the porcine retina, which has a high cone/rod ratio. This feature allows to properly evaluate both cone and rod photoreceptors transduction and compare the transduction characteristics of AAV2/5 and 2/8, the two most efficient AAV vector serotypes for photoreceptor targeting. Here we show that AAV2/5 and 2/8 transduces both RPE and photoreceptors. AAV2/8 infects and transduces photoreceptor more efficiently than AAV2/5, similarly to what we have observed in the murine retina. The use of the photoreceptor-specific rhodopsin promoter restricts transgene expression to porcine rods and cones, and results in photoreceptor transduction levels similar to those obtained with the ubiquitous promoters tested. Finally, immunological, toxicological and biodistribution studies support the safety of AAV subretinal administration to the large porcine retina. The data presented here on AAV-mediated transduction of the cone-enriched porcine retina may affect the development of gene-based therapies for rare and common severe photoreceptor diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt20113"

We demonstrated previously the feasibility of ex vivo genetic programming of mouse bone marrow precursors with LVs encoding granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4), which induced autonomous differentiation of long-lived dendritic cells (DCs), referred to as self-differentiated myeloid-derived antigen-presenting-cells reactive against tumors (SMART-DCs). Here, LV biosafety was enhanced by using a DC-restricted and physiological promoter, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II promoter, and including co-expression of the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (sr39HSV-TK) conditional suicide gene. Tricistronic vectors co-expressing sr39HSV-TK, GM-CSF and IL-4 transcriptionally regulated by the MHCII promoter or the ubiquitous cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter were compared. Despite the different gene transfer effects, such as the kinetics, levels of transgene expression and persistency of integrated vector copies, both vectors induced highly viable SMART-DCs, which persisted for at least 70 days in vivo and could be ablated with the pro-drug Ganciclovir (GCV). SMART-DCs co-expressing the tyrosine-related protein 2 melanoma antigen administered subcutaneously generated antigen-specific, anti-melanoma protective and therapeutic responses in the mouse B16 melanoma model. GCV administration after immunotherapy did not abrogate DC vaccination efficacy. This demonstrates proof-of-principle of genetically programmed DCs that can be ablated pharmacologically.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt201115"

In this study, we demonstrated that intratumoral (i.t.) injection of MSCs expressing modified interleukin-12 (MSCs/IL-12M) exhibited stronger tumor-specific T-cell responses and antitumor effects as well as more sustained expressions of IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-γ in both sera and tumor sites than did IL-12M-expressing adenovirus (rAd/IL-12M) in mice bearing both solid and metastatic tumors. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of MSCs/IL-12M at contralateral site of tumor exhibited similar levels of serum IL-12 and IFN-γ as i.t. injection, but much weaker antitumor effects in both B16F10 melanoma and TC-1 cervical cancer models than i.t. injection. Although intravenous (i.v.) injection elicited earlier peak serum levels of cytokines, it induced weaker tumor-specific T-cell responses and antitumor effects than i.t. injection, indicating that serum cytokine levels are not surrogate indicators of antitumor effects. Taken together, these results indicated that MSC is more efficient than adenovirus as a cytokine gene delivery vehicle and that i.t. injection of MSCs/IL-12M is the best approach to induce strong tumor-specific T-cell responses that correlate with anti-metastatic effects as well as inhibition of solid tumor growth, although MSCs themselves have an ability to migrate into the tumor site. In addition, MSCs/IL-12M embedded in Matrigel (MSCs/IL-12M/Matrigel) exhibited significant antitumor effects even in immunodeficient mice such as SCID and BNX mice lacking T, B and natural killer (NK) cells, but not in IFN-γ knockout mice. Our findings provide an optimal approach for designing an efficient clinical protocol of MSC-based cytokine gene therapy to induce strong tumor-specific T-cell responses and therapeutic anticancer efficacy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2010170"
"gt","Down-modulation of cancer targets using locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based antisense oligonucleotides without transfection","Usually, small interfering RNAs and most antisense molecules need mechanical or chemical delivery methods to down-modulate the targeted mRNA. However, these delivery approaches complicate the interpretations of biological consequences. We show that locked nucleic acid (LNA)-based antisense oligonucleotides (LNA–ONs) readily down-modulate genes of interest in multiple cell lines without any delivery means. The down-modulation of genes was quick, robust, long-lasting and specific followed by potent down-modulation of protein. The efficiency of the effect varied among the 30 tumor cell lines investigated. The most robust effects were found in those cells where nuclear localization of the LNA–ON was clearly observed. Importantly, without using any delivery agent, we demonstrated that HER3 mRNA and protein could be efficiently down-modulated in cells and a tumor xenograft model. These data provide a simple and efficient approach to identify potential drug targets and animal models. Further elucidation of the mechanism of cellular uptake and trafficking of LNA–ONs may enhance not only the therapeutic values of this platform but also antisense molecules in general.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2010133"

To evaluate the transduction of hematopoietic progenitor cells at the single-cell level, we measured VCN in individual colony-forming cell (CFC) units, using an adapted quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) method. The feasibility, reproducibility and sensitivity of this approach were tested with characterized cell lines carrying known numbers of vector integration. The method was validated by correlating data in CFC with gene expression or with calculated values, and was found to slightly underestimate VCN. In spite of this, such Q-PCR on CFC was useful to compare transduction levels with different infection protocols and different vectors. Increasing the vector concentration and re-iterating the infection were two different strategies that improved transduction by increasing the frequency of transduced progenitor cells. Repeated infection also augmented the number of integrated copies and the magnitude of this effect seemed to depend on the vector preparation. Thus, the distribution of VCN in hematopoietic colonies may depend upon experimental conditions including features of vectors. This should be carefully evaluated in the context of ex vivo hematopoietic gene therapy studies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2010163"

We previously developed HAC vectors from the normal human chromosomes using a chromosome engineering technique. However, endogenous genes were remained in these HACs, limiting their therapeutic applications. In this study, we refined a HAC vector without endogenous genes from human chromosome 21 in homologous recombination-proficient chicken DT40 cells. The HAC was physically characterized using a transformation-associated recombination (TAR) cloning strategy followed by sequencing of TAR-bacterial artificial chromosome clones. No endogenous genes were remained in the HAC. We demonstrated that any desired gene can be cloned into the HAC using the Cre-loxP system in Chinese hamster ovary cells, or a homologous recombination system in DT40 cells. The HAC can be efficiently transferred to other type of cells including mouse ES cells via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. The transferred HAC was stably maintained in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, tumor cells containing a HAC carrying the suicide gene, herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK), were selectively killed by ganciclovir in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this novel HAC vector may be useful not only for gene and cell therapy, but also for animal transgenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2010147"
"gt","Transfection of shRNA-encoding Minivector DNA of a few hundred base pairs to regulate gene expression in lymphoma cells","This work illustrates the utility of Minivector DNA, a non-viral, supercoiled gene therapy vector incorporating short hairpin RNA from an H1 promoter. Minivector DNA is superior to both plasmid DNA and small interfering RNA (siRNA) in that it has improved biostability while maintaining high cell transfection efficiency and gene silencing capacity. Minivector DNAs were stable for over 48 h in human serum, as compared with only 0.5 and 2 h for siRNA and plasmid, respectively. Although all three nucleic acids exhibited similar transfection efficiencies in easily transfected adhesion fibroblasts cells, only Minivector DNAs and siRNA were capable of transfecting difficult-to-transfect suspension lymphoma cells. Minivector DNA and siRNA were capable of silencing the gene encoding anaplastic lymphoma kinase, a key pathogenic factor of human anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and this silencing caused inhibition of the lymphoma cells. Based on these results, Minivector DNAs are a promising new gene therapy tool.","https://www.nature.com/articles/gt2010123"
