"nataging","Chromatin accessibility dynamics of neurogenic niche cells reveal defects in neural stem cell adhesion and migration during aging","The regenerative potential of brain stem cell niches deteriorates during aging. Yet the mechanisms underlying this decline are largely unknown. Here we characterize genome-wide chromatin accessibility of neurogenic niche cells in vivo during aging. Interestingly, chromatin accessibility at adhesion and migration genes decreases with age in quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs) but increases with age in activated (proliferative) NSCs. Quiescent and activated NSCs exhibit opposing adhesion behaviors during aging: quiescent NSCs become less adhesive, whereas activated NSCs become more adhesive. Old activated NSCs also show decreased migration in vitro and diminished mobilization out of the niche for neurogenesis in vivo. Using tension sensors, we find that aging increases force-producing adhesions in activated NSCs. Inhibiting the cytoskeletal-regulating kinase ROCK reduces these adhesions, restores migration in old activated NSCs in vitro, and boosts neurogenesis in vivo. These results have implications for restoring the migratory potential of NSCs and for improving neurogenesis in the aged brain.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00449-3"
"nataging","Removal of senescent cells reduces the viral load and attenuates pulmonary and systemic inflammation in SARS-CoV-2-infected, aged hamsters","Older age is one of the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19. In this study, we determined whether age-associated cellular senescence contributes to the severity of experimental COVID-19. Aged golden hamsters accumulate senescent cells in the lungs, and the senolytic drug ABT-263, a BCL-2 inhibitor, depletes these cells at baseline and during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Relative to young hamsters, aged hamsters had a greater viral load during the acute phase of infection and displayed higher levels of sequelae during the post-acute phase. Early treatment with ABT-263 lowered pulmonary viral load in aged (but not young) animals, an effect associated with lower expression of ACE2, the receptor for SARS-CoV-2. ABT-263 treatment also led to lower pulmonary and systemic levels of senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors and to amelioration of early and late lung disease. These data demonstrate the causative role of age-associated pre-existing senescent cells on COVID-19 severity and have clear clinical relevance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00442-w"
"nataging","Longevity factor klotho enhances cognition in aged nonhuman primates","Cognitive dysfunction in aging is a major biomedical challenge. Whether treatment with klotho, a longevity factor, could enhance cognition in human-relevant models such as in nonhuman primates is unknown and represents a major knowledge gap in the path to therapeutics. We validated the rhesus form of the klotho protein in mice showing it increased synaptic plasticity and cognition. We then found that a single administration of low-dose, but not high-dose, klotho enhanced memory in aged nonhuman primates. Systemic low-dose klotho treatment may prove therapeutic in aging humans.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00441-x"

"nataging","Targeting lymphoid-derived IL-17 signaling to delay skin aging","Skin aging is characterized by structural and functional changes that contribute to age-associated frailty. This probably depends on synergy between alterations in the local niche and stem cell-intrinsic changes, underscored by proinflammatory microenvironments that drive pleotropic changes. The nature of these age-associated inflammatory cues, or how they affect tissue aging, is unknown. Based on single-cell RNA sequencing of the dermal compartment of mouse skin, we show a skew towards an IL-17-expressing phenotype of T helper cells, [gamma][delta] T cells and innate lymphoid cells in aged skin. Importantly, in vivo blockade of IL-17 signaling during aging reduces the proinflammatory state of the skin, delaying the appearance of age-related traits. Mechanistically, aberrant IL-17 signals through NF-[kappa]B in epidermal cells to impair homeostatic functions while promoting an inflammatory state. Our results indicate that aged skin shows signs of chronic inflammation and that increased IL-17 signaling could be targeted to prevent age-associated skin ailments.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00431-z"
"nataging","Reduced mitochondrial calcium uptake in macrophages is a major driver of inflammaging","Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to age-associated inflammation or inflammaging, but underlying mechanisms are not understood. Analyses of 700 human blood transcriptomes revealed clear signs of age-associated low-grade inflammation. Among changes in mitochondrial components, we found that the expression of mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and its regulatory subunit MICU1, genes central to mitochondrial Ca2+ (mCa2+) signaling, correlated inversely with age. Indeed, mCa2+ uptake capacity of mouse macrophages decreased significantly with age. We show that in both human and mouse macrophages, reduced mCa2+ uptake amplifies cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations and potentiates downstream nuclear factor kappa B activation, which is central to inflammation. Our findings pinpoint the mitochondrial calcium uniporter complex as a keystone molecular apparatus that links age-related changes in mitochondrial physiology to systemic macrophage-mediated age-associated inflammation. The findings raise the exciting possibility that restoring mCa2+ uptake capacity in tissue-resident macrophages may decrease inflammaging of specific organs and alleviate age-associated conditions such as neurodegenerative and cardiometabolic diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00436-8"
"nataging","Human microglia show unique transcriptional changes in Alzheimer's disease","Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, influence Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression and are potential therapeutic targets. However, microglia exhibit diverse functions, the regulation of which is not fully understood, complicating therapeutics development. To better define the transcriptomic phenotypes and gene regulatory networks associated with AD, we enriched for microglia nuclei from 12 AD and 10 control human dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (7 males and 15 females, all aged >60 years) before single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Here we describe both established and previously unrecognized microglial molecular phenotypes, the inferred gene networks driving observed transcriptomic change, and apply trajectory analysis to reveal the putative relationships between microglial phenotypes. We identify microglial phenotypes more prevalent in AD cases compared with controls. Further, we describe the heterogeneity in microglia subclusters expressing homeostatic markers. Our study demonstrates that deep profiling of microglia in human AD brain can provide insight into microglial transcriptional changes associated with AD.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00424-y"
"nataging","Immunovirological and environmental screening reveals actionable risk factors for fatal COVID-19 during post-vaccination nursing home outbreaks","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination has resulted in excellent protection against fatal disease, including in older adults. However, risk factors for post-vaccination fatal COVID-19 are largely unknown. We comprehensively studied three large nursing home outbreaks (20-35% fatal cases among residents) by combining severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) aerosol monitoring, whole-genome phylogenetic analysis and immunovirological profiling of nasal mucosa by digital nCounter transcriptomics. Phylogenetic investigations indicated that each outbreak stemmed from a single introduction event, although with different variants (Delta, Gamma and Mu). SARS-CoV-2 was detected in aerosol samples up to 52 d after the initial infection. Combining demographic, immune and viral parameters, the best predictive models for mortality comprised IFNB1 or age, viral ORF7a and ACE2 receptor transcripts. Comparison with published pre-vaccine fatal COVID-19 transcriptomic and genomic signatures uncovered a unique IRF3 low/IRF7 high immune signature in post-vaccine fatal COVID-19 outbreaks. A multi-layered strategy, including environmental sampling, immunomonitoring and early antiviral therapy, should be considered to prevent post-vaccination COVID-19 mortality in nursing homes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00421-1"

"nataging","Gut-specific telomerase expression counteracts systemic aging in telomerase-deficient zebrafish","Telomere shortening is a hallmark of aging and is counteracted by telomerase. As in humans, the zebrafish gut is one of the organs with the fastest rate of telomere decline, triggering early tissue dysfunction during normal zebrafish aging and in prematurely aged telomerase mutants. However, whether telomere-dependent aging of an individual organ, the gut, causes systemic aging is unknown. Here we show that tissue-specific telomerase expression in the gut can prevent telomere shortening and rescues premature aging of tert−/−. Induction of telomerase rescues gut senescence and low cell proliferation, while restoring tissue integrity, inflammation and age-dependent microbiota dysbiosis. Averting gut aging causes systemic beneficial impacts, rescuing aging of distant organs such as reproductive and hematopoietic systems. Conclusively, we show that gut-specific telomerase expression extends the lifespan of tert−/− by 40%, while ameliorating natural aging. Our work demonstrates that gut-specific rescue of telomerase expression leading to telomere elongation is sufficient to systemically counteract aging in zebrafish.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00401-5"

"nataging","Mass spectrometric simultaneous quantification of tau species in plasma shows differential associations with amyloid and tau pathologies","Blood phosphorylated tau (p-tau) biomarkers, at differing sites, demonstrate high accuracy to detect Alzheimerʼs disease (AD). However, knowledge on the optimal marker for disease identification across the AD continuum and the link to pathology is limited. This is partly due to heterogeneity in analytical methods. In this study, we employed an immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry method to simultaneously quantify six phosphorylated (p-tau181, p-tau199, p-tau202, p-tau205, p-tau217 and p-tau231) and two non-phosphorylated plasma tau peptides in a total of 214 participants from the Paris Lariboisière and Translational Biomarkers of Aging and Dementia cohorts. Our results indicate that p-tau217, p-tau231 and p-tau205 are the plasma tau forms that best reflect AD-related brain changes, although with distinct emergences along the disease course and correlations with AD features-amyloid and tau. These findings support the differential association of blood p-tau variants with AD pathology, and our method offers a potential tool for disease staging in clinical trials.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00405-1"
"nataging","Attitudes related to technology for active and healthy aging in a national multigenerational survey","Research is needed to understand attitudes toward and adoption of the broad range of technologies available to support active and healthy aging in different generations. The present article gives an overview of the GenerationTech survey and sample, and describes attitudes and acceptance related to technology in general and as a means to support active and healthy aging. A national survey was conducted with a random sample (n = 2,121) including men and women from three generations (30-39, 50-59 and 70-79-year-olds) in Sweden. The generations shared some attitudes toward and acceptance of technologies for active and healthy aging. However, what kind of technologies are preferred to support active and healthy aging and the reasons for using certain technologies differed by generation. The findings could help guide the development and implementation of technologies for active and healthy aging throughout the aging process.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00392-3"
"nataging","Cold temperature extends longevity and prevents disease-related protein aggregation through PA28[gamma]-induced proteasomes","Aging is a primary risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders that involve protein aggregation. Because lowering body temperature is one of the most effective mechanisms to extend longevity in both poikilotherms and homeotherms, a better understanding of cold-induced changes can lead to converging modifiers of pathological protein aggregation. Here, we find that cold temperature (15  degreesC) selectively induces the trypsin-like activity of the proteasome in Caenorhabditis elegans through PSME-3, the worm orthologue of human PA28[gamma]/PSME3. This proteasome activator is required for cold-induced longevity and ameliorates age-related deficits in protein degradation. Moreover, cold-induced PA28[gamma]/PSME-3 diminishes protein aggregation in C. elegans models of age-related diseases such as Huntington's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Notably, exposure of human cells to moderate cold temperature (36  degreesC) also activates trypsin-like activity through PA28[gamma]/PSME3, reducing disease-related protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. Together, our findings reveal a beneficial role of cold temperature that crosses evolutionary boundaries with potential implications for multi-disease prevention.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00383-4"
"nataging","Insufficient epitope-specific T cell clones are responsible for impaired cellular immunity to inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine in older adults","Aging is a critical risk factor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine efficacy. The immune responses to inactivated vaccine for older adults, and the underlying mechanisms of potential differences to young adults, are still unclear. Here we show that neutralizing antibody production by older adults took a longer time to reach similar levels in young adults after inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. We screened SARS-CoV-2 variant strains for epitopes that stimulate specific CD8 T cell response, and older adults exhibited weaker CD8 T-cell-mediated responses to these epitopes. Comparison of lymphocyte transcriptomes from pre-vaccinated and post-vaccinated donors suggested that the older adults had impaired antigen processing and presentation capability. Single-cell sequencing revealed that older adults had less T cell clone expansion specific to SARS-CoV-2, likely due to inadequate immune receptor repertoire size and diversity. Our study provides mechanistic insights for weaker response to inactivated vaccine by older adults and suggests the need for further vaccination optimization for the old population.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00379-0"
"nataging","CSF tau phosphorylation occupancies at T217 and T205 represent improved biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease","Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid-[beta] peptide (A[beta])42/A[beta]40 and the concentration of tau phosphorylated at site 181 (p-tau181) are well-established biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study used mass spectrometry to measure concentrations of nine phosphorylated and five nonphosphorylated tau species and phosphorylation occupancies (percentage phosphorylated/nonphosphorylated) at ten sites. In the present study we show that, in 750 individuals with a median age of 71.2 years, CSF pT217/T217 predicted the presence of brain amyloid by positron emission tomography (PET) slightly better than A[beta]42/A[beta]40 (P = 0.02). Furthermore, for individuals with positive brain amyloid by PET (n = 263), CSF pT217/T217 was more strongly correlated with the amount of amyloid (Spearman's [rho] = 0.69) than A[beta]42/A[beta]40 ([rho] = −0.42, P < 0.0001). In two independent cohorts of participants with symptoms of AD dementia (n = 55 and n = 90), CSF pT217/T217 and pT205/T205 were better correlated with tau PET measures than CSF p-tau181 concentration. These findings suggest that CSF pT217/T217 and pT205/T205 represent improved CSF biomarkers of amyloid and tau pathology in AD.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00380-7"
"nataging","Heterochronic parabiosis reprograms the mouse brain transcriptome by shifting aging signatures in multiple cell types","Aging is a complex process involving transcriptomic changes associated with deterioration across multiple tissues and organs, including the brain. Recent studies using heterochronic parabiosis have shown that various aspects of aging-associated decline are modifiable or even reversible. To better understand how this occurs, we performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling of young and old mouse brains after parabiosis. For each cell type, we cataloged alterations in gene expression, molecular pathways, transcriptional networks, ligand-receptor interactions and senescence status. Our analyses identified gene signatures, demonstrating that heterochronic parabiosis regulates several hallmarks of aging in a cell-type-specific manner. Brain endothelial cells were found to be especially malleable to this intervention, exhibiting dynamic transcriptional changes that affect vascular structure and function. These findings suggest new strategies for slowing deterioration and driving regeneration in the aging brain through approaches that do not rely on disease-specific mechanisms or actions of individual circulating factors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00373-6"
"nataging","Neuronal APOE4 removal protects against tau-mediated gliosis, neurodegeneration and myelin deficits","Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is the strongest known genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conditions of stress or injury induce APOE expression within neurons, but the role of neuronal APOE4 in AD pathogenesis is still unclear. Here we report the characterization of neuronal APOE4 effects on AD-related pathologies in an APOE4-expressing tauopathy mouse model. The selective genetic removal of APOE4 from neurons led to a significant reduction in tau pathology, gliosis, neurodegeneration, neuronal hyperexcitability and myelin deficits. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing revealed that the removal of neuronal APOE4 greatly diminished neurodegenerative disease-associated subpopulations of neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglia whose accumulation correlated to the severity of tau pathology, neurodegeneration and myelin deficits. Thus, neuronal APOE4 plays a central role in promoting the development of major AD pathologies and its removal can mitigate the progressive cellular and tissue alterations occurring in this model of APOE4-driven tauopathy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00368-3"
"nataging","Chronic in vivo imaging defines age-dependent alterations of neurogenesis in the mouse hippocampus","Neural stem cells (NSCs) generate new neurons throughout life in the mammalian hippocampus1. Advancing age leads to a decline in neurogenesis, which is associated with impaired cognition2,3. The cellular mechanisms causing reduced neurogenesis with advancing age remain largely unknown. We genetically labeled NSCs through conditional recombination driven by the regulatory elements of the stem-cell-expressed gene GLI family zinc finger 1 (Gli1) and used chronic intravital imaging to follow individual NSCs and their daughter cells over months within their hippocampal niche4,5. We show that aging affects multiple steps, from cell cycle entry of quiescent NSCs to determination of the number of surviving cells, ultimately causing reduced clonal output of individual NSCs. Thus, we here define the developmental stages that may be targeted to enhance neurogenesis with the aim of maintaining hippocampal plasticity with advancing age.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00370-9"
"nataging","Effect of long-term caloric restriction on DNA methylation measures of biological aging in healthy adults from the CALERIE trial","The geroscience hypothesis proposes that therapy to slow or reverse molecular changes that occur with aging can delay or prevent multiple chronic diseases and extend healthy lifespan1,2,3. Caloric restriction (CR), defined as lessening caloric intake without depriving essential nutrients4, results in changes in molecular processes that have been associated with aging, including DNA methylation (DNAm)5,6,7, and is established to increase healthy lifespan in multiple species8,9. Here we report the results of a post hoc analysis of the influence of CR on DNAm measures of aging in blood samples from the Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy (CALERIE) trial, a randomized controlled trial in which n = 220 adults without obesity were randomized to 25% CR or ad libitum control diet for 2 yr (ref. 10). We found that CALERIE intervention slowed the pace of aging, as measured by the DunedinPACE DNAm algorithm, but did not lead to significant changes in biological age estimates measured by various DNAm clocks including PhenoAge and GrimAge. Treatment effect sizes were small. Nevertheless, modest slowing of the pace of aging can have profound effects on population health11,12,13. The finding that CR modified DunedinPACE in a randomized controlled trial supports the geroscience hypothesis, building on evidence from small and uncontrolled studies14,15,16 and contrasting with reports that biological aging may not be modifiable17. Ultimately, a conclusive test of the geroscience hypothesis will require trials with long-term follow-up to establish effects of intervention on primary healthy-aging endpoints, including incidence of chronic disease and mortality18,19,20.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00357-y"
"nataging","Systemic GDF11 attenuates depression-like phenotype in aged mice via stimulation of neuronal autophagy","Cognitive decline and mood disorders increase in frequency with age. Many efforts are focused on the identification of molecules and pathways to treat these conditions. Here, we demonstrate that systemic administration of growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11) in aged mice improves memory and alleviates senescence and depression-like symptoms in a neurogenesis-independent manner. Mechanistically, GDF11 acts directly on hippocampal neurons to enhance neuronal activity via stimulation of autophagy. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses of these neurons reveal that GDF11 reduces the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a master regulator of autophagy. Using a murine model of corticosterone-induced depression-like phenotype, we also show that GDF11 attenuates the depressive-like behavior of young mice. Analysis of sera from young adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) reveals reduced GDF11 levels. These findings identify mechanistic pathways related to GDF11 action in the brain and uncover an unknown role for GDF11 as an antidepressant candidate and biomarker.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00352-3"
"nataging","Unique progerin C-terminal peptide ameliorates Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome phenotype by rescuing BUBR1","An accumulating body of evidence indicates an association between mitotic defects and the aging process in Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), which is a premature aging disease caused by progerin accumulation. Here, we found that BUBR1, a core component of the spindle assembly checkpoint, was downregulated during HGPS cellular senescence. The remaining BUBR1 was anchored to the nuclear membrane by binding with the C terminus of progerin, thus further limiting the function of BUBR1. Based on this, we established a unique progerin C-terminal peptide (UPCP) that effectively blocked the binding of progerin and BUBR1 and enhanced the expression of BUBR1 by interfering with the interaction between PTBP1 and progerin. Finally, UPCP significantly inhibited HGPS cellular senescence and ameliorated progeroid phenotypes, extending the lifespan of LmnaG609G/G609G mice. Our findings reveal an essential role for the progerin-PTBP1-BUBR1 axis in HGPS. Therapeutics designed around UPCP may be a beneficial strategy for HGPS treatment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-023-00361-w"
"nataging","Strong peak immunogenicity but rapid antibody waning following third vaccine dose in older residents of care homes","Third-dose coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines are being deployed widely but their efficacy has not been assessed adequately in vulnerable older people who exhibit suboptimal responses after primary vaccination series. This observational study, which was carried out by the VIVALDI study based in England, looked at spike-specific immune responses in 341 staff and residents in long-term care facilities who received an mRNA vaccine following dual primary series vaccination with BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1. Third-dose vaccination strongly increased antibody responses with preferential relative enhancement in older people and was required to elicit neutralization of Omicron. Cellular immune responses were also enhanced with strong cross-reactive recognition of Omicron. However, antibody titers fell 21-78% within 100 d after vaccine and 27% of participants developed a breakthrough Omicron infection. These findings reveal strong immunogenicity of a third vaccine in one of the most vulnerable population groups and endorse an approach for widespread delivery across this population. Ongoing assessment will be required to determine the stability of immune protection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00328-3"
"nataging","Impaired CD4+ T cell response in older adults is associated with reduced immunogenicity and reactogenicity of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination","Whether age-associated defects in T cells impact the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of mRNA vaccines remains unclear. Using a vaccinated cohort (n = 216), we demonstrated that older adults (aged >=65 years) had fewer vaccine-induced spike-specific CD4+ T cells including CXCR3+ circulating follicular helper T cells and the TH1 subset of helper T cells after the first dose, which correlated with their lower peak IgG levels and fewer systemic adverse effects after the second dose, compared with younger adults. Moreover, spike-specific TH1 cells in older adults expressed higher levels of programmed cell death protein 1, a negative regulator of T cell activation, which was associated with low spike-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Thus, an inefficient CD4+ T cell response after the first dose may reduce the production of helper T cytokines, even after the second dose, thereby lowering humoral and cellular immunity and reducing systemic reactogenicity. Therefore, enhancing CD4+ T cell response following the first dose is key to improving vaccine efficacy in older adults.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00343-4"
"nataging","piRNAs regulate a Hedgehog germline-to-soma pro-aging signal","The reproductive system regulates somatic aging through competing anti- and pro-aging signals. Germline removal extends somatic lifespan through conserved pathways including insulin and mammalian target-of-rapamycin signaling, while germline hyperactivity shortens lifespan through unknown mechanisms. Here we show that mating-induced germline hyperactivity downregulates piRNAs, in turn desilencing their targets, including the Hedgehog-like ligand-encoding genes wrt-1 and wrt-10, ultimately causing somatic collapse and death. Germline-produced Hedgehog signals require PTR-6 and PTR-16 receptors for mating-induced shrinking and death. Our results reveal an unconventional role of the piRNA pathway in transcriptional regulation of Hedgehog signaling and a new role of Hedgehog signaling in the regulation of longevity and somatic maintenance: Hedgehog signaling is controlled by the tunable piRNA pathway to encode the previously unknown germline-to-soma pro-aging signal. Mating-induced piRNA downregulation in the germline and subsequent Hedgehog signaling to the soma enable the animal to tune somatic resource allocation to germline needs, optimizing reproductive timing and survival.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00329-2"
"nataging","Nucleophagy delays aging and preserves germline immortality","Marked alterations in nuclear ultrastructure are a universal hallmark of aging, progeroid syndromes and other age-related pathologies. Here we show that autophagy of nuclear proteins is an important determinant of fertility and aging. Impairment of nucleophagy diminishes stress resistance, germline immortality and longevity. We found that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear envelope anchor protein, nuclear anchorage protein 1 (ANC-1) and its mammalian ortholog nesprin-2 are cleared out by autophagy and restrict nucleolar size, a biomarker of aging. We further uncovered a germline immortality assurance mechanism, which involves nucleolar degradation at the most proximal oocyte by ANC-1 and key autophagic components. Perturbation of this clearance pathway causes tumor-like structures in C. elegans, and genetic ablation of nesprin-2 causes ovarian carcinomas in mice. Thus, autophagic recycling of nuclear components is a conserved soma longevity and germline immortality mechanism that promotes youthfulness and delays aging under conditions of stress.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00327-4"
"nataging","Cell-type-specific aging clocks to quantify aging and rejuvenation in neurogenic regions of the brain","The diversity of cell types is a challenge for quantifying aging and its reversal. Here we develop 'aging clocks' based on single-cell transcriptomics to characterize cell-type-specific aging and rejuvenation. We generated single-cell transcriptomes from the subventricular zone neurogenic region of 28 mice, tiling ages from young to old. We trained single-cell-based regression models to predict chronological age and biological age (neural stem cell proliferation capacity). These aging clocks are generalizable to independent cohorts of mice, other regions of the brains, and other species. To determine if these aging clocks could quantify transcriptomic rejuvenation, we generated single-cell transcriptomic datasets of neurogenic regions for two interventions-heterochronic parabiosis and exercise. Aging clocks revealed that heterochronic parabiosis and exercise reverse transcriptomic aging in neurogenic regions, but in different ways. This study represents the first development of high-resolution aging clocks from single-cell transcriptomic data and demonstrates their application to quantify transcriptomic rejuvenation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00335-4"
"nataging","Aging is associated with a systemic length-associated transcriptome imbalance","Aging is among the most important risk factors for morbidity and mortality. To contribute toward a molecular understanding of aging, we analyzed age-resolved transcriptomic data from multiple studies. Here, we show that transcript length alone explains most transcriptional changes observed with aging in mice and humans. We present three lines of evidence supporting the biological importance of the uncovered transcriptome imbalance. First, in vertebrates the length association primarily displays a lower relative abundance of long transcripts in aging. Second, eight antiaging interventions of the Interventions Testing Program of the National Institute on Aging can counter this length association. Third, we find that in humans and mice the genes with the longest transcripts enrich for genes reported to extend lifespan, whereas those with the shortest transcripts enrich for genes reported to shorten lifespan. Our study opens fundamental questions on aging and the organization of transcriptomes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00317-6"
"nataging","Sexual identity of enterocytes regulates autophagy to determine intestinal health, lifespan and responses to rapamycin","Pharmacological attenuation of mTOR presents a promising route for delay of age-related disease. Here we show that treatment of Drosophila with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin extends lifespan in females, but not in males. Female-specific, age-related gut pathology is markedly slowed by rapamycin treatment, mediated by increased autophagy. Treatment increases enterocyte autophagy in females, via the H3/H4 histone-Bchs axis, whereas males show high basal levels of enterocyte autophagy that are not increased by rapamycin feeding. Enterocyte sexual identity, determined by transformerFemale expression, dictates sexually dimorphic cell size, H3/H4-Bchs expression, basal rates of autophagy, fecundity, intestinal homeostasis and lifespan extension in response to rapamycin. Dimorphism in autophagy is conserved in mice, where intestine, brown adipose tissue and muscle exhibit sex differences in autophagy and response to rapamycin. This study highlights tissue sex as a determining factor in the regulation of metabolic processes by mTOR and the efficacy of mTOR-targeted, anti-aging drug treatments.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00308-7"
"nataging","Microglial activation protects against accumulation of tau aggregates in nondemented individuals with underlying Alzheimer's disease pathology","The role of microglia in tau accumulation is currently unclear but could provide an important insight into the mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD)1. Here, we measured the microglial marker soluble TREM2 and the disease-associated microglial activation stage 2 markers AXL, MERTK, GAS6, LPL, CST7, SPP1 and CSF1 in nondemented individuals from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort who underwent longitudinal tau-positron emission tomography (PET), amyloid-PET and global cognitive assessment. To assess whether baseline microglial markers had an effect on AD-related changes, we studied three sub-groups of individuals: 121 with evidence of amyloid-PET pathology (A+), 64 with additional evidence of tau-PET pathology (A+T+) and 159 without amyloid- or tau-PET pathology (A−T−). Our results showed that increased levels of TREM2 were associated with slower amyloid accumulation in A+ individuals in addition to slower tau deposition and cognitive decline in A+T+ subjects. Similarly, higher levels of AXL, MERTK, GAS6, LPL, CST7 and CSF1 predicted slower tau accumulation and/or cognitive decline in the A+T+ group. These findings have important implications for future therapeutic strategies aiming to boost microglial protective functions in AD.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00310-z"
"nataging","Toward an improved definition of a healthy microbiome for healthy aging","The gut microbiome is a modifier of disease risk because it interacts with nutrition, metabolism, immunity and infection. Aging-related health loss has been correlated with transition to different microbiome states. Microbiome summary indices including alpha diversity are apparently useful to describe these states but belie taxonomic differences that determine biological importance. We analyzed 21,000 fecal microbiomes from seven data repositories, across five continents spanning participant ages 18-107 years, revealing that microbiome diversity and uniqueness correlate with aging, but not healthy aging. Among summary statistics tested, only Kendall uniqueness accurately reflects loss of the core microbiome and the abundance and ranking of disease-associated and health-associated taxa. Increased abundance of these disease-associated taxa and depletion of a coabundant subset of health-associated taxa are a generic feature of aging. These alterations are stronger correlates of unhealthy aging than most microbiome summary statistics and thus help identify better targets for therapeutic modulation of the microbiome.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00306-9"
"nataging","Immune system-wide Mendelian randomization and triangulation analyses support autoimmunity as a modifiable component in dementia-causing diseases","Immune system and blood-brain barrier dysfunction are implicated in the development of Alzheimer's and other dementia-causing diseases, but their causal role remains unknown. We performed Mendelian randomization for 1,827 immune system- and blood-brain barrier-related biomarkers and identified 127 potential causal risk factors for dementia-causing diseases. Pathway analyses linked these biomarkers to amyloid-[beta], tau and [alpha]-synuclein pathways and to autoimmunity-related processes. A phenome-wide analysis using Mendelian randomization-based polygenic risk score in the FinnGen study (n = 339,233) for the biomarkers indicated shared genetic background for dementias and autoimmune diseases. This association was further supported by human leukocyte antigen analyses. In inverse-probability-weighted analyses that simulate randomized controlled drug trials in observational data, anti-inflammatory methotrexate treatment reduced the incidence of Alzheimer's disease in high-risk individuals (hazard ratio compared with no treatment, 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.49-0.88, P = 0.005). These converging results from different lines of human research suggest that autoimmunity is a modifiable component in dementia-causing diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00293-x"

However, several studies indicated that there is reduced vaccine effectiveness among older individuals, which is correlated with their general health status1,2. How and to what extent age-related immunological defects are responsible for the suboptimal vaccine responses observed in older individuals receiving SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA vaccine, is unclear and not fully investigated1,3,4,5. In this observational study, we investigated adaptive immune responses in adults of various ages (22-99 years old) receiving 2 doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Vaccine-induced Spike-specific antibody, and T and memory B cell responses decreased with increasing age. These responses positively correlated with the percentages of peripheral naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and negatively with CD8+ T cells expressing signs of immunosenescence. Older adults displayed a preferred T cell response to the S2 region of the Spike protein, which is relatively conserved and a target for cross-reactive T cells induced by human 'common cold' coronaviruses. Memory T cell responses to influenza virus were not affected by age-related changes, nor the SARS-CoV-2-specific response induced by infection. Collectively, we identified signs of immunosenescence correlating with the outcome of vaccination against a new viral antigen to which older adults are immunologically naïve. This knowledge is important for the management of COVID-19 infections in older adults.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00292-y"

Here, we analyzed the current, quantitative microbiome composition in the older adult Bruneck Study cohort (Italians, Bruneck, n = 304 (male, 154; female, 150); age 65-98 years) with extensive clinical, demographic, lifestyle and nutritional data collected over the past 26 years4. Multivariate analysis of historical variables indicated that medication history, historical physical activity, past dietary habits and specific past laboratory blood parameters explain a significant fraction of current quantitative microbiome variation in older adults, enlarging the explanatory power of contemporary covariates by 33.4%. Prediction of current enterotype by a combination of past and contemporary host variables revealed good levels of predictability (area under the curve (AUC), 0.78-0.83), with Prevotella and dysbiotic Bacteroides 2 being the best predicted enterotypes. These findings demonstrate long-term life history effects on the microbiota and provide insights into lifestyle variables and their role in maintaining a healthy gut microbiota in later life.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00286-w"
"nataging","Complement C1q-dependent excitatory and inhibitory synapse elimination by astrocytes and microglia in Alzheimer's disease mouse models","Microglia and complement can mediate neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). By integrative multi-omics analysis, here we show that astrocytic and microglial proteins are increased in TauP301S synapse fractions with age and in a C1q-dependent manner. In addition to microglia, we identified that astrocytes contribute substantially to synapse elimination in TauP301S hippocampi. Notably, we found relatively more excitatory synapse marker proteins in astrocytic lysosomes, whereas microglial lysosomes contained more inhibitory synapse material. C1q deletion reduced astrocyte-synapse association and decreased astrocytic and microglial synapses engulfment in TauP301S mice and rescued synapse density. Finally, in an AD mouse model that combines [beta]-amyloid and Tau pathologies, deletion of the AD risk gene Trem2 impaired microglial phagocytosis of synapses, whereas astrocytes engulfed more inhibitory synapses around plaques. Together, our data reveal that astrocytes contact and eliminate synapses in a C1q-dependent manner and thereby contribute to pathological synapse loss and that astrocytic phagocytosis can compensate for microglial dysfunction.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00281-1"
"nataging","Decreased spliceosome fidelity and egl-8 intron retention inhibit mTORC1 signaling to promote longevity","Changes in splicing fidelity are associated with loss of homeostasis and aging, yet only a handful of splicing factors have been shown to be causally required to promote longevity, and the underlying mechanisms and downstream targets in these paradigms remain elusive. Surprisingly, we found a hypomorphic mutation within ribonucleoprotein RNP-6/poly(U)-binding factor 60 kDa (PUF60), a spliceosome component promoting weak 3'-splice site recognition, which causes aberrant splicing, elevates stress responses and enhances longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Through genetic suppressor screens, we identify a gain-of-function mutation within rbm-39, an RNP-6-interacting splicing factor, which increases nuclear speckle formation, alleviates splicing defects and curtails longevity caused by rnp-6 mutation. By leveraging the splicing changes induced by RNP-6/RBM-39 activities, we uncover intron retention in egl-8/phospholipase C [beta]4 (PLCB4) as a key splicing target prolonging life. Genetic and biochemical evidence show that neuronal RNP-6/EGL-8 downregulates mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling to control organismal lifespan. In mammalian cells, PUF60 downregulation also potently and specifically inhibits mTORC1 signaling. Altogether, our results reveal that splicing fidelity modulates lifespan through mTOR signaling.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00275-z"
"nataging","Males induce premature demise of the opposite sex by multifaceted strategies","Interactions between the sexes negatively impact health in many species. In Caenorhabditis, males shorten the lifespan of the opposite sex-hermaphrodites or females. Here we use transcriptomic profiling and targeted screens to systematically uncover conserved genes involved in male-induced demise in C. elegans. Some genes (for example, delm-2, acbp-3), when knocked down, are specifically protective against male-induced demise. Others (for example, sri-40), when knocked down, extend lifespan with and without males, suggesting general mechanisms of protection. In contrast, many classical long-lived mutants are impacted more negatively than wild type by the presence of males, highlighting the importance of sexual environment for longevity. Interestingly, genes induced by males are triggered by specific male components (seminal fluid, sperm and pheromone), and manipulating these genes in combination in hermaphrodites induces stronger protection. One of these genes, the conserved ion channel delm-2, acts in the nervous system and intestine to regulate lipid metabolism. Our analysis reveals striking differences in longevity in single sex versus mixed sex environments and uncovers elaborate strategies elicited by sexual interactions that could extend to other species.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00276-y"
"nataging","Long-lasting geroprotection from brief rapamycin treatment in early adulthood by persistently increased intestinal autophagy","The licensed drug rapamycin has potential to be repurposed for geroprotection. A key challenge is to avoid adverse side effects from continuous dosing. Here we show that geroprotective effects of chronic rapamycin treatment can be obtained with a brief pulse of the drug in early adulthood in female Drosophila and mice. In Drosophila, a brief, early rapamycin treatment of adults extended lifespan and attenuated age-related decline in the intestine to the same degree as lifelong dosing. Lasting memory of earlier treatment was mediated by elevated autophagy in intestinal enterocytes, accompanied by increased levels of intestinal LManV and lysozyme. Brief elevation of autophagy in early adulthood itself induced a long-term increase in autophagy. In mice, a 3-month, early treatment also induced a memory effect, with maintenance similar to chronic treatment, of lysozyme distribution, Man2B1 level in intestinal crypts, Paneth cell architecture and gut barrier function, even 6 months after rapamycin was withdrawn.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00278-w"
"nataging","Nuclear morphology is a deep learning biomarker of cellular senescence","Cellular senescence is an important factor in aging and many age-related diseases, but understanding its role in health is challenging due to the lack of exclusive or universal markers. Using neural networks, we predict senescence from the nuclear morphology of human fibroblasts with up to 95% accuracy, and investigate murine astrocytes, murine neurons, and fibroblasts with premature aging in culture. After generalizing our approach, the predictor recognizes higher rates of senescence in p21-positive and ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU)-negative nuclei in tissues and shows an increasing rate of senescent cells with age in H&E-stained murine liver tissue and human dermal biopsies. Evaluating medical records reveals that higher rates of senescent cells correspond to decreased rates of malignant neoplasms and increased rates of osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, hypertension and cerebral infarction. In sum, we show that morphological alterations of the nucleus can serve as a deep learning predictor of senescence that is applicable across tissues and species and is associated with health outcomes in humans.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00263-3"
"nataging","Somatic mutations in single human cardiomyocytes reveal age-associated DNA damage and widespread oxidative genotoxicity","The accumulation of somatic DNA mutations over time is a hallmark of aging in many dividing and nondividing cells but has not been studied in postmitotic human cardiomyocytes. Using single-cell whole-genome sequencing, we identified and characterized the landscape of somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNVs) in 56 single cardiomyocytes from 12 individuals (aged from 0.4 to 82 years). Cardiomyocyte sSNVs accumulate with age at rates that are faster than in many dividing cell types and nondividing neurons. Cardiomyocyte sSNVs show distinctive mutational signatures that implicate failed nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair of oxidative DNA damage, and defective mismatch repair. Since age-accumulated sSNVs create many damaging mutations that disrupt gene functions, polyploidization in cardiomyocytes may provide a mechanism of genetic compensation to minimize the complete knockout of essential genes during aging. Age-related accumulation of cardiac mutations provides a paradigm to understand the influence of aging on cardiac dysfunction.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00261-5"

Previous attempts to develop aging metrics were hampered by cross-sectional designs and/or focused on younger populations. In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), we collected longitudinally across the adult age range a comprehensive list of phenotypes within four domains (body composition, energetics, homeostatic mechanisms and neurodegeneration/neuroplasticity) and functional outcomes. We integrated individual deviations from population trajectories into a global longitudinal phenotypic metric of aging and demonstrate that accelerated longitudinal phenotypic aging is associated with faster physical and cognitive decline, faster accumulation of multimorbidity and shorter survival. These associations are more robust compared with the use of phenotypic and epigenetic measurements at a single time point. Estimation of these metrics required repeated measures of multiple phenotypes over time but may uniquely facilitate the identification of mechanisms driving phenotypic aging and subsequent age-related functional decline.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00243-7"
"nataging","An IL1RL1 genetic variant lowers soluble ST2 levels and the risk effects of APOE-[epsilon]4 in female patients with Alzheimer's disease","Changes in the levels of circulating proteins are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas their pathogenic roles in AD are unclear. Here, we identified soluble ST2 (sST2), a decoy receptor of interleukin-33-ST2 signaling, as a new disease-causing factor in AD. Increased circulating sST2 level is associated with more severe pathological changes in female individuals with AD. Genome-wide association analysis and CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing identified rs1921622, a genetic variant in an enhancer element of IL1RL1, which downregulates gene and protein levels of sST2. Mendelian randomization analysis using genetic variants, including rs1921622, demonstrated that decreased sST2 levels lower AD risk and related endophenotypes in females carrying the Apolipoprotein E (APOE)-[epsilon]4 genotype; the association is stronger in Chinese than in European-descent populations. Human and mouse transcriptome and immunohistochemical studies showed that rs1921622/sST2 regulates amyloid-beta (A[beta]) pathology through the modulation of microglial activation and A[beta] clearance. These findings demonstrate how sST2 level is modulated by a genetic variation and plays a disease-causing role in females with AD.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00241-9"

We identify cell type-specific signatures of aging in neuronal subtypes as well as astrocytes and microglia. We uncover changes in cell types critical for metabolic regulation and body composition and in an area of the hypothalamus linked to cognition. Our analysis also reveals an unexpected female-specific feature of hypothalamic aging: the master regulator of X inactivation, Xist, is elevated with age, particularly in hypothalamic neurons. Moreover, using machine learning, we show that levels of X chromosome genes and Xist itself, can accurately predict cellular age. This study identifies critical cell-specific changes of the aging hypothalamus in mammals and uncovers a potential marker of neuronal aging in females.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00246-4"

We show that residents of long-term care facilities developed high and stable levels of antibodies against spike protein and receptor-binding domain. Nucleocapsid-specific responses were also elevated but waned over time. Antibodies showed stable and equivalent levels of functional inhibition against spike-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 binding in all age groups with comparable activity against viral variants of concern. SARS-CoV-2 seropositive donors showed high levels of antibodies to other beta-coronaviruses but serostatus did not impact humoral immunity to influenza or other respiratory syncytial viruses. SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular responses were similar across all ages but virus-specific populations showed elevated levels of activation in older donors. Thus, survivors of SARS-CoV-2 infection show a robust and stable immunity against the virus that does not negatively impact responses to other seasonal viruses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00224-w"
"nataging","The relationship between epigenetic age and the hallmarks of aging in human cells","Epigenetic clocks are mathematically derived age estimators that are based on combinations of methylation values that change with age at specific CpGs in the genome. These clocks are widely used to measure the age of tissues and cells1,2. The discrepancy between epigenetic age (EpiAge), as estimated by these clocks, and chronological age is referred to as EpiAge acceleration. Epidemiological studies have linked EpiAge acceleration to a wide variety of pathologies, health states, lifestyle, mental state and environmental factors2, indicating that epigenetic clocks tap into critical biological processes that are involved in aging. Despite the importance of this inference, the mechanisms underpinning these clocks remained largely uncharacterized and unelucidated. Here, using primary human cells, we set out to investigate whether epigenetic aging is the manifestation of one or more of the aging hallmarks previously identified3. We show that although epigenetic aging is distinct from cellular senescence, telomere attrition and genomic instability, it is associated with nutrient sensing, mitochondrial activity and stem cell composition.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00220-0"

Using the topographical information from [18F]MK6240 tau positron-emission tomography (PET), we applied the Braak tau staging system to 324 living individuals. We used PET-based Braak stage to model the trajectories of amyloid-[beta], phosphorylated tau (pTau) in cerebrospinal fluid (pTau181, pTau217, pTau231 and pTau235) and plasma (pTau181 and pTau231), neurodegeneration and cognitive symptoms. We identified nonlinear AD biomarker trajectories corresponding to the spatial extent of tau-PET, with modest biomarker changes detectable by Braak stage II and significant changes occurring at stages III-IV, followed by plateaus. Early Braak stages were associated with isolated memory impairment, whereas Braak stages V-VI were incompatible with normal cognition. In 159 individuals with follow-up tau-PET, progression beyond stage III took place uniquely in the presence of amyloid-[beta] positivity. Our findings support PET-based Braak staging as a framework to model the natural history of AD and monitor AD severity in living humans.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00204-0"

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have linked more than 20 loci to phenotypes related to human lifespan1. However, little is known about how lifespan is impacted by gene loss of function. Through whole-exome sequencing of 352,338 UK Biobank participants of European ancestry, we assessed the relevance of protein-truncating variant (PTV) gene burden on individual and parental survival. We identified four exome-wide significant (P < 4.2 × 10−7) human lifespan genes, BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM and TET2. Gene and gene-set, PTV-burden, phenome-wide association studies support known roles of these genes in cancer to impact lifespan at the population level. The TET2 PTV burden was associated with a lifespan through somatic mutation events presumably due to clonal hematopoiesis. The overlap between PTV burden and common variant-based lifespan GWASs was modest, underscoring the value of exome sequencing in well-powered biobank cohorts to complement GWASs for identifying genes underlying complex traits.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00182-3"

In the present study, we report the development and validation of a retinal photograph-based, deep-learning algorithm for automated detection of visually significant cataracts, using more than 25,000 images from population-based studies. In the internal test set, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 96.6%. External testing performed across three studies showed AUROCs of 91.6-96.5%. In a separate test set of 186 eyes, we further compared the algorithm's performance with 4 ophthalmologists' evaluations. The algorithm performed comparably, if not being slightly more superior (sensitivity of 93.3% versus 51.7-96.6% by ophthalmologists and specificity of 99.0% versus 90.7-97.9% by ophthalmologists).

However, the mechanisms and signaling pathways that regulate senescence remain elusive. In this report, we performed post-genome-wide association studies (GWAS) functional studies on the CDKN2A/B locus, a locus known to be associated with multiple age-related diseases and overall human lifespan. We demonstrate that transcription factor CUX1 (Cut-Like Homeobox 1) specifically binds to an atherosclerosis-associated functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (fSNP) (rs1537371) within the locus and regulates the CDKN2A/B-encoded proteins p14ARF, p15INK4b and p16INK4a and the antisense noncoding RNA in the CDK4 (INK4) locus (ANRIL) in endothelial cells (ECs). Endothelial CUX1 expression correlates with telomeric length and is induced by both DNA-damaging agents and oxidative stress. Moreover, induction of CUX1 expression triggers both replicative and stress-induced senescence via activation of p16INK4a expression. Thus, our studies identify CUX1 as a regulator of p16INK4a-dependent endothelial senescence and a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis and other age-related diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00177-0"
"nataging","Intracrine activity involving NAD-dependent circadian steroidogenic activity governs age-associated meibomian gland dysfunction","Canonically, hormones are produced in the endocrine organs and delivered to target tissues. However, for steroids, the concept of tissue intracrinology, whereby hormones are produced in the tissues where they exert their effect without release into circulation, has been proposed, but its role in physiology/disease remains unclear. The meibomian glands in the eyelids produce oil to prevent tear evaporation, which reduces with aging. Here, we demonstrate that (re)activation of local intracrine activity through nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent circadian 3[beta]-hydroxyl-steroid dehydrogenase (3[beta]-HSD) activity ameliorates age-associated meibomian gland dysfunction and accompanying evaporative dry eye disease. Genetic ablation of 3[beta]-HSD nullified local steroidogenesis and led to atrophy of the meibomian gland. Conversely, reactivation of 3[beta]-HSD activity by boosting its coenzyme NAD+ availability improved glandular cell proliferation and alleviated the dry eye disease phenotype. Both women and men express 3[beta]-HSD in the meibomian gland. Enhancing local steroidogenesis may help combat age-associated meibomian gland dysfunction.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00167-8"

The source of these changes, and how MuSCs respond to mitochondrial dysfunction, are unknown. We report here that in response to mitochondrial ROS, murine MuSCs directly fuse with neighboring myofibers; this phenomenon removes ETC-dysfunctional MuSCs from the stem cell compartment. MuSC-myofiber fusion is dependent on the induction of Scinderin, which promotes formation of actin-dependent protrusions required for membrane fusion. During aging, we find that the declining MuSC population accumulates mutations in the mitochondrial genome but selects against dysfunctional variants. In the absence of clearance by Scinderin, the decline in MuSC numbers during aging is repressed; however, ETC-dysfunctional MuSCs are retained and can regenerate dysfunctional myofibers. We propose a model in which ETC-dysfunctional MuSCs are removed from the stem cell compartment by fusing with differentiated tissue.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00164-x"

Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2-infected cells trigger senescence-like cell-cycle arrest2,3 in neighboring uninfected cells in a paracrine manner via virus-induced cytokine production. In cultured human cells or bronchial organoids, these SASR-CoV-2 infection-induced senescent cells express high levels of a series of inflammatory factors known as senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASPs)4 in a sustained manner, even after SARS-CoV-2 is no longer detectable. We also show that the expression of the senescence marker CDKN2A (refs. 5,6) and various SASP factor4 genes is increased in the pulmonary cells of patients with severe post-acute COVID-19 syndrome. Furthermore, we find that mice exposed to a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2 exhibit prolonged signs of cellular senescence and SASP in the lung at 14 days after infection when the virus was undetectable, which could be substantially reduced by the administration of senolytic drugs7. The sustained infection-induced paracrine senescence described here may be involved in the long-term inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-022-00170-7"

However, it has been unknown whether NMRs also evade aging according to a primary hallmark of aging: epigenetic changes. To address this question, we profiled n = 385 samples from 11 tissue types at loci that are highly conserved between mammalian species using a custom array (HorvathMammalMethylChip40). We observed strong epigenetic aging effects and developed seven highly accurate epigenetic clocks for several tissues (pan-tissue, blood, kidney, liver, skin clocks) and two dual-species (human-NMR) clocks. The skin clock correctly estimated induced pluripotent stem cells derived from NMR fibroblasts to be of prenatal age. The NMR epigenetic clocks revealed that breeding NMR queens age more slowly than nonbreeders, a feature that is also observed in some eusocial insects. Our results show that despite a phenotype of negligible senescence, the NMR ages epigenetically.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00152-1"

It is unclear which brain changes lead to these outcomes. Longitudinal imaging-based measures of brain structure and function were examined in adult individuals (baseline age, 45-86 years; two to five visits per participant over 1-9 years). College degree completion differentiates individual-based and neighborhood-based measures of socioeconomic status and disadvantage. Older adults (~65 years and over) without a college degree exhibit a pattern of declining large-scale functional brain network organization (resting-state system segregation) that is less evident in their college-educated peers. Declining brain system segregation predicts impending changes in dementia severity, measured up to 10 years past the last scan date. The prognostic value of brain network change is independent of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related genetic risk (APOE status), the presence of AD-associated pathology (cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau, cortical amyloid) and cortical thinning. These results demonstrate that the trajectory of an individual's brain network organization varies in relation to their educational attainment and, more broadly, is a unique indicator of individual brain health during older age.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00125-4"

We examined whether age predicts prosociality in a preregistered global study (46,576 people aged 18-99 across 67 countries) using two acutely relevant measures: distancing during COVID-19 and willingness to donate to hypothetical charities. Age positively predicted prosociality on both measures, with increased distancing and donations among older adults. However, older adults were more in-group focused than younger adults in choosing who to help, making larger donations to national over international charities and reporting increased in-group preferences. In-group preferences helped explain greater national over international donations. Results were robust to several control analyses and internal replication.

In the present study, we show that histologically normal breast tissue from younger women who are susceptible to breast cancer, as a result of harboring a germline mutation in BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 genes, exhibits hallmarks of accelerated aging. These include proportionately increased luminal epithelial cells that acquired myoepithelial markers, decreased proportions of myoepithelial cells and a basal differentiation bias or failure of differentiation of cKit+ progenitors. High-risk luminal and myoepithelial cells are transcriptionally enriched for genes of the opposite lineage, inflammatory- and cancer-related pathways. We have identified breast-aging hallmarks that reflect a convergent biology of cancer susceptibility, regardless of the specific underlying genetic or age-dependent risk or the associated breast cancer subtype.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00104-9"
"nataging","Chromatin remodeling due to degradation of citrate carrier impairs osteogenesis of aged mesenchymal stem cells","Aging is accompanied by a general decline in the function of many cellular pathways. However, whether these are causally or functionally interconnected remains elusive. Here, we study the effect of mitochondrial-nuclear communication on stem cell aging. We show that aged mesenchymal stem cells exhibit reduced chromatin accessibility and lower histone acetylation, particularly on promoters and enhancers of osteogenic genes. The reduced histone acetylation is due to impaired export of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, owing to the lower levels of citrate carrier (CiC). We demonstrate that aged cells showed enhanced lysosomal degradation of CiC, which is mediated via mitochondrial-derived vesicles. Strikingly, restoring cytosolic acetyl-CoA levels either by exogenous CiC expression or via acetate supplementation, remodels the chromatin landscape and rescues the osteogenesis defects of aged mesenchymal stem cells. Collectively, our results establish a tight, age-dependent connection between mitochondrial quality control, chromatin and stem cell fate, which are linked together by CiC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00105-8"
"nataging","The economic value of targeting aging","Developments in life expectancy and the growing emphasis on biological and 'healthy' aging raise a number of important questions for health scientists and economists alike. Is it preferable to make lives healthier by compressing morbidity, or longer by extending life? What are the gains from targeting aging itself compared to efforts to eradicate specific diseases? Here we analyze existing data to evaluate the economic value of increases in life expectancy, improvements in health and treatments that target aging. We show that a compression of morbidity that improves health is more valuable than further increases in life expectancy, and that targeting aging offers potentially larger economic gains than eradicating individual diseases. We show that a slowdown in aging that increases life expectancy by 1 year is worth US$38 trillion, and by 10 years, US$367 trillion. Ultimately, the more progress that is made in improving how we age, the greater the value of further improvements.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00080-0"
