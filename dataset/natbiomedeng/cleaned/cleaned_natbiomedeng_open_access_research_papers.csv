Here we report the development of triple-input polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (OCT) for measuring posterior scleral birefringence. In guinea pigs and humans, the technique offers superior imaging sensitivities and accuracies than dual-input polarization-sensitive OCT. In 8-week-long studies with young guinea pigs, scleral birefringence was positively correlated with spherical equivalent refractive errors and predicted the onset of myopia. In a cross-sectional study involving adult individuals, scleral birefringence was associated with myopia status and negatively correlated with refractive errors. Triple-input polarization-sensitive OCT may help establish posterior scleral birefringence as a non-invasive biomarker for assessing the progression of myopia.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01062-w"
"natbiomedeng","Rapid and stain-free quantification of viral plaque via lens-free holography and deep learning","A plaque assay-the gold-standard method for measuring the concentration of replication-competent lytic virions-requires staining and usually more than 48 h of runtime. Here we show that lens-free holographic imaging and deep learning can be combined to expedite and automate the assay. The compact imaging device captures phase information label-free at a rate of approximately 0.32 gigapixels per hour per well, covers an area of about 30 × 30 mm2 and a 10-fold larger dynamic range of virus concentration than standard assays, and quantifies the infected area and the number of plaque-forming units. For the vesicular stomatitis virus, the automated plaque assay detected the first cell-lysing events caused by viral replication as early as 5 h after incubation, and in less than 20 h it detected plaque-forming units at rates higher than 90% at 100% specificity. Furthermore, it reduced the incubation time of the herpes simplex virus type 1 by about 48 h and that of the encephalomyocarditis virus by about 20 h. The stain-free assay should be amenable for use in virology research, vaccine development and clinical diagnosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01057-7"
"natbiomedeng","Resolving sepsis-induced immunoparalysis via trained immunity by targeting interleukin-4 to myeloid cells","Immunoparalysis is a compensatory and persistent anti-inflammatory response to trauma, sepsis or another serious insult, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections, morbidity and mortality. Here, we show that in cultured primary human monocytes, interleukin-4 (IL4) inhibits acute inflammation, while simultaneously inducing a long-lasting innate immune memory named trained immunity. To take advantage of this paradoxical IL4 feature in vivo, we developed a fusion protein of apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) and IL4, which integrates into a lipid nanoparticle. In mice and non-human primates, an intravenously injected apoA1-IL4-embedding nanoparticle targets myeloid-cell-rich haematopoietic organs, in particular, the spleen and bone marrow. We subsequently demonstrate that IL4 nanotherapy resolved immunoparalysis in mice with lipopolysaccharide-induced hyperinflammation, as well as in ex vivo human sepsis models and in experimental endotoxemia. Our findings support the translational development of nanoparticle formulations of apoA1-IL4 for the treatment of patients with sepsis at risk of immunoparalysis-induced complications.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01050-0"
"natbiomedeng","Universal redirection of CAR T cells against solid tumours via membrane-inserted ligands for the CAR","The effectiveness of chimaeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies for solid tumours is hindered by difficulties in the selection of an effective target antigen, owing to the heterogeneous expression of tumour antigens and to target antigen expression in healthy tissues. Here we show that T cells with a CAR specific for fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) can be directed against solid tumours via the intratumoural administration of a FITC-conjugated lipid-poly(ethylene)-glycol amphiphile that inserts itself into cell membranes. In syngeneic and human tumour xenografts in mice, 'amphiphile tagging' of tumour cells drove tumour regression via the proliferation and accumulation of FITC-specific CAR T cells in the tumours. In syngeneic tumours, the therapy induced the infiltration of host T cells, elicited endogenous tumour-specific T cell priming and led to activity against distal untreated tumours and to protection against tumour rechallenge. Membrane-inserting ligands for specific CARs may facilitate the development of adoptive cell therapies that work independently of antigen expression and of tissue of origin.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01048-8"
"natbiomedeng","Detection of viral RNAs at ambient temperature via reporter proteins produced through the target-splinted ligation of DNA probes","Nucleic acid assays are not typically deployable in point-of-care settings because they require costly and sophisticated equipment for the control of the reaction temperature and for the detection of the signal. Here we report an instrument-free assay for the accurate and multiplexed detection of nucleic acids at ambient temperature. The assay, which we named INSPECTR (for internal splint-pairing expression-cassette translation reaction), leverages the target-specific splinted ligation of DNA probes to generate expression cassettes that can be flexibly designed for the cell-free synthesis of reporter proteins, with enzymatic reporters allowing for a linear detection range spanning four orders of magnitude and peptide reporters (which can be mapped to unique targets) enabling highly multiplexed visual detection. We used INSPECTR to detect a panel of five respiratory viral targets in a single reaction via a lateral-flow readout and ~4,000 copies of viral RNA via additional ambient-temperature rolling circle amplification of the expression cassette. Leveraging synthetic biology to simplify workflows for nucleic acid diagnostics may facilitate their broader applicability at the point of care.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01028-y"
"natbiomedeng","Suppression of local inflammation via galectin-anchored indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase","The treatment of chronic inflammation with systemically administered anti-inflammatory treatments is associated with moderate-to-severe side effects, and the efficacy of locally administered drugs is short-lived. Here we show that inflammation can be locally suppressed by a fusion protein of the immunosuppressive enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO) and galectin-3 (Gal3). Gal3 anchors IDO to tissue, limiting the diffusion of IDO-Gal3 away from the injection site. In rodent models of endotoxin-induced inflammation, psoriasis, periodontal disease and osteoarthritis, the fusion protein remained in the inflamed tissues and joints for about 1 week after injection, and the amelioration of local inflammation, disease progression and inflammatory pain in the animals were concomitant with homoeostatic preservation of the tissues and with the absence of global immune suppression. IDO-Gal3 may serve as an immunomodulatory enzyme for the control of focal inflammation in other inflammatory conditions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01025-1"
"natbiomedeng","Ex vivo prime editing of patient haematopoietic stem cells rescues sickle-cell disease phenotypes after engraftment in mice","Sickle-cell disease (SCD) is caused by an A·T-to-T·A transversion mutation in the [beta]-globin gene (HBB). Here we show that prime editing can correct the SCD allele (HBBS) to wild type (HBBA) at frequencies of 15%-41% in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from patients with SCD. Seventeen weeks after transplantation into immunodeficient mice, prime-edited SCD HSPCs maintained HBBA levels and displayed engraftment frequencies, haematopoietic differentiation and lineage maturation similar to those of unedited HSPCs from healthy donors. An average of 42% of human erythroblasts and reticulocytes isolated 17 weeks after transplantation of prime-edited HSPCs from four SCD patient donors expressed HBBA, exceeding the levels predicted for therapeutic benefit. HSPC-derived erythrocytes carried less sickle haemoglobin, contained HBBA-derived adult haemoglobin at 28%-43% of normal levels and resisted hypoxia-induced sickling. Minimal off-target editing was detected at over 100 sites nominated experimentally via unbiased genome-wide analysis. Our findings support the feasibility of a one-time prime editing SCD treatment that corrects HBBS to HBBA, does not require any viral or non-viral DNA template and minimizes undesired consequences of DNA double-strand breaks.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01026-0"
"natbiomedeng","A lentiviral vector for the production of T cells with an inducible transgene and a constitutively expressed tumour-targeting receptor","Vectors that facilitate the engineering of T cells that can better harness endogenous immunity and overcome suppressive barriers in the tumour microenvironment would help improve the safety and efficacy of T-cell therapies for more patients. Here we report the design, production and applicability, in T-cell engineering, of a lentiviral vector leveraging an antisense configuration and comprising a promoter driving the constitutive expression of a tumour-directed receptor and a second promoter enabling the efficient activation-inducible expression of a genetic payload. The vector allows for the delivery of a variety of genes to human T cells, as we show for interleukin-2 and a microRNA-based short hairpin RNA for the knockdown of the gene coding for haematopoietic progenitor kinase 1, a negative regulator of T-cell-receptor signalling. We also show that a gene encoded under an activation-inducible promoter is specifically expressed by tumour-redirected T cells on encountering a target antigen in the tumour microenvironment. The single two-gene-encoding vector can be produced at high titres under an optimized protocol adaptable to good manufacturing practices.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01013-5"
"natbiomedeng","Optimization of Cas9 activity through the addition of cytosine extensions to single-guide RNAs","The precise regulation of the activity of Cas9 is crucial for safe and efficient editing. Here we show that the genome-editing activity of Cas9 can be constrained by the addition of cytosine stretches to the 5'-end of conventional single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Such a 'safeguard sgRNA' strategy, which is compatible with Cas12a and with systems for gene activation and interference via CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), leads to the length-dependent inhibition of the formation of functional Cas9 complexes. Short cytosine extensions reduced p53 activation and cytotoxicity in human pluripotent stem cells, and enhanced homology-directed repair while maintaining bi-allelic editing. Longer extensions further decreased on-target activity yet improved the specificity and precision of mono-allelic editing. By monitoring indels through a fluorescence-based allele-specific system and computational simulations, we identified optimal windows of Cas9 activity for a number of genome-editing applications, including bi-allelic and mono-allelic editing, and the generation and correction of disease-associated single-nucleotide substitutions via homology-directed repair. The safeguard-sgRNA strategy may improve the safety and applicability of genome editing.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01011-7"
"natbiomedeng","Rapid single-cell physical phenotyping of mechanically dissociated tissue biopsies","During surgery, rapid and accurate histopathological diagnosis is essential for clinical decision making. Yet the prevalent method of intra-operative consultation pathology is intensive in time, labour and costs, and requires the expertise of trained pathologists. Here we show that biopsy samples can be analysed within 30 min by sequentially assessing the physical phenotypes of singularized suspended cells dissociated from the tissues. The diagnostic method combines the enzyme-free mechanical dissociation of tissues, real-time deformability cytometry at rates of 100-1,000 cells s−1 and data analysis by unsupervised dimensionality reduction and logistic regression. Physical phenotype parameters extracted from brightfield images of single cells distinguished cell subpopulations in various tissues, enhancing or even substituting measurements of molecular markers. We used the method to quantify the degree of colon inflammation and to accurately discriminate healthy and tumorous tissue in biopsy samples of mouse and human colons. This fast and label-free approach may aid the intra-operative detection of pathological changes in solid biopsies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01015-3"
"natbiomedeng","High-throughput spatiotemporal monitoring of single-cell secretions via plasmonic microwell arrays","Methods for the analysis of cell secretions at the single-cell level only provide semiquantitative endpoint readouts. Here we describe a microwell array for the real-time spatiotemporal monitoring of extracellular secretions from hundreds of single cells in parallel. The microwell array incorporates a gold substrate with arrays of nanometric holes functionalized with receptors for a specific analyte, and is illuminated with light spectrally overlapping with the device's spectrum of extraordinary optical transmission. Spectral shifts in surface plasmon resonance resulting from analyte-receptor bindings around a secreting cell are recorded by a camera as variations in the intensity of the transmitted light while machine-learning-assisted cell tracking eliminates the influence of cell movements. We used the microwell array to characterize the antibody-secretion profiles of hybridoma cells and of a rare subset of antibody-secreting cells sorted from human donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells. High-throughput measurements of spatiotemporal secretory profiles at the single-cell level will aid the study of the physiological mechanisms governing protein secretion.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01017-1"
"natbiomedeng","Surgical polarimetric endoscopy for the detection of laryngeal cancer","The standard-of-care for the detection of laryngeal pathologies involves distinguishing suspicious lesions from surrounding healthy tissue via contrasts in colour and texture captured by white-light endoscopy. However, the technique is insufficiently sensitive and thus leads to unsatisfactory rates of false negatives. Here we show that laryngeal lesions can be better detected in real time by taking advantage of differences in the light-polarization properties of cancer and healthy tissues. By measuring differences in polarized-light retardance and depolarization, the technique, which we named 'surgical polarimetric endoscopy' (SPE), generates about one-order-of-magnitude greater contrast than white-light endoscopy, and hence allows for the better discrimination of cancerous lesions, as we show with patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma. Polarimetric imaging of excised and stained slices of laryngeal tissue indicated that changes in the retardance of polarized light can be largely attributed to architectural features of the tissue. We also assessed SPE to aid routine transoral laser surgery for the removal of a cancerous lesion, indicating that SPE can complement white-light endoscopy for the detection of laryngeal cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01018-0"
"natbiomedeng","A vision transformer for decoding surgeon activity from surgical videos","The intraoperative activity of a surgeon has substantial impact on postoperative outcomes. However, for most surgical procedures, the details of intraoperative surgical actions, which can vary widely, are not well understood. Here we report a machine learning system leveraging a vision transformer and supervised contrastive learning for the decoding of elements of intraoperative surgical activity from videos commonly collected during robotic surgeries. The system accurately identified surgical steps, actions performed by the surgeon, the quality of these actions and the relative contribution of individual video frames to the decoding of the actions. Through extensive testing on data from three different hospitals located in two different continents, we show that the system generalizes across videos, surgeons, hospitals and surgical procedures, and that it can provide information on surgical gestures and skills from unannotated videos. Decoding intraoperative activity via accurate machine learning systems could be used to provide surgeons with feedback on their operating skills, and may allow for the identification of optimal surgical behaviour and for the study of relationships between intraoperative factors and postoperative outcomes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-023-01010-8"
"natbiomedeng","Multi-omics microsampling for the profiling of lifestyle-associated changes in health","Current healthcare practices are reactive and use limited physiological and clinical information, often collected months or years apart. Moreover, the discovery and profiling of blood biomarkers in clinical and research settings are constrained by geographical barriers, the cost and inconvenience of in-clinic venepuncture, low sampling frequency and the low depth of molecular measurements. Here we describe a strategy for the frequent capture and analysis of thousands of metabolites, lipids, cytokines and proteins in 10 [mu]l of blood alongside physiological information from wearable sensors. We show the advantages of such frequent and dense multi-omics microsampling in two applications: the assessment of the reactions to a complex mixture of dietary interventions, to discover individualized inflammatory and metabolic responses; and deep individualized profiling, to reveal large-scale molecular fluctuations as well as thousands of molecular relationships associated with intra-day physiological variations (in heart rate, for example) and with the levels of clinical biomarkers (specifically, glucose and cortisol) and of physical activity. Combining wearables and multi-omics microsampling for frequent and scalable omics may facilitate dynamic health profiling and biomarker discovery.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00999-8"
"natbiomedeng","Treatment of peanut allergy and colitis in mice via the intestinal release of butyrate from polymeric micelles","The microbiome modulates host immunity and aids the maintenance of tolerance in the gut, where microbial and food-derived antigens are abundant. Yet modern dietary factors and the excessive use of antibiotics have contributed to the rising incidence of food allergies, inflammatory bowel disease and other non-communicable chronic diseases associated with the depletion of beneficial taxa, including butyrate-producing Clostridia. Here we show that intragastrically delivered neutral and negatively charged polymeric micelles releasing butyrate in different regions of the intestinal tract restore barrier-protective responses in mouse models of colitis and of peanut allergy. Treatment with the butyrate-releasing micelles increased the abundance of butyrate-producing taxa in Clostridium cluster XIVa, protected mice from an anaphylactic reaction to a peanut challenge and reduced disease severity in a T-cell-transfer model of colitis. By restoring microbial and mucosal homoeostasis, butyrate-releasing micelles may function as an antigen-agnostic approach for the treatment of allergic and inflammatory diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00972-5"
"natbiomedeng","Optimization of the proliferation and persistency of CAR T cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells","The effectiveness of chimaeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapies against solid tumours relies on the accumulation, proliferation and persistency of T cells at the tumour site. Here we show that the proliferation of CD8[alpha][beta] cytotoxic CAR T cells in solid tumours can be enhanced by deriving and expanding them from a single human induced-pluripotent-stem-cell clone bearing a CAR selected for efficient differentiation. We also show that the proliferation and persistency of the effector cells in the tumours can be further enhanced by genetically knocking out diacylglycerol kinase, which inhibits antigen-receptor signalling, and by transducing the cells with genes encoding for membrane-bound interleukin-15 (IL-15) and its receptor subunit IL-15R[alpha]. In multiple tumour-bearing animal models, the engineered hiPSC-derived CAR T cells led to therapeutic outcomes similar to those of primary CD8 T cells bearing the same CAR. The optimization of effector CAR T cells derived from pluripotent stem cells may aid the development of long-lasting antigen-specific T-cell immunotherapies for the treatment of solid tumours.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00969-0"
"natbiomedeng","An implantable soft robotic ventilator augments inspiration in a pig model of respiratory insufficiency","Severe diaphragm dysfunction can lead to respiratory failure and to the need for permanent mechanical ventilation. Yet permanent tethering to a mechanical ventilator through the mouth or via tracheostomy can hinder a patient's speech, swallowing ability and mobility. Here we show, in a porcine model of varied respiratory insufficiency, that a contractile soft robotic actuator implanted above the diaphragm augments its motion during inspiration. Synchronized actuation of the diaphragm-assist implant with the native respiratory effort increased tidal volumes and maintained ventilation flow rates within the normal range. Robotic implants that intervene at the diaphragm rather than at the upper airway and that augment physiological metrics of ventilation may restore respiratory performance without sacrificing quality of life.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00971-6"
"natbiomedeng","A library of base editors for the precise ablation of all protein-coding genes in the mouse mitochondrial genome","The development of curative treatments for mitochondrial diseases, which are often caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that impair energy metabolism and other aspects of cellular homoeostasis, is hindered by an incomplete understanding of the underlying biology and a scarcity of cellular and animal models. Here we report the design and application of a library of double-stranded-DNA deaminase-derived cytosine base editors optimized for the precise ablation of every mtDNA protein-coding gene in the mouse mitochondrial genome. We used the library, which we named MitoKO, to produce near-homoplasmic knockout cells in vitro and to generate a mouse knockout with high heteroplasmy levels and no off-target edits. MitoKO should facilitate systematic and comprehensive investigations of mtDNA-related pathways and their impact on organismal homoeostasis, and aid the generation of clinically meaningful in vivo models of mtDNA dysfunction.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00968-1"
"natbiomedeng","Designing receptor agonists with enhanced pharmacokinetics by grafting macrocyclic peptides into fragment crystallizable regions","Short half-lives in circulation and poor transport across the blood-brain barrier limit the utility of cytokines and growth factors acting as receptor agonists. Here we show that surrogate receptor agonists with longer half-lives in circulation and enhanced transport rates across the blood-brain barrier can be generated by genetically inserting macrocyclic peptide pharmacophores into the structural loops of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of a human immunoglobulin. We used such 'lasso-grafting' approach, which preserves the expression levels of the Fc region and its affinity for the neonatal Fc receptor, to generate Fc-based protein scaffolds with macrocyclic peptides binding to the receptor tyrosine protein kinase Met. The Met agonists dimerized Met, inducing biological responses that were similar to those induced by its natural ligand. Moreover, lasso-grafting of the Fc region of the mouse anti-transferrin-receptor antibody with Met-binding macrocyclic peptides enhanced the accumulation of the resulting Met agonists in brain parenchyma in mice. Lasso-grafting may allow for designer protein therapeutics with enhanced stability and pharmacokinetics.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00955-6"
"natbiomedeng","Tomographic detection of photon pairs produced from high-energy X-rays for the monitoring of radiotherapy dosing","Measuring the radiation dose reaching a patient's body is difficult. Here we report a technique for the tomographic reconstruction of the location of photon pairs originating from the annihilation of positron-electron pairs produced by high-energy X-rays travelling through tissue. We used Monte Carlo simulations on pre-recorded data from tissue-mimicking phantoms and from a patient with a brain tumour to show the feasibility of this imaging modality, which we named 'pair-production tomography', for the monitoring of radiotherapy dosing. We simulated three image-reconstruction methods, one applicable to a pencil X-ray beam scanning through a region of interest, and two applicable to the excitation of tissue volumes via broad beams (with temporal resolution sufficient to identify coincident photon pairs via filtered back projection, or with higher temporal resolution sufficient for the estimation of a photon's time-of-flight). In addition to the monitoring of radiotherapy dosing, we show that image contrast resulting from pair-production tomography is highly proportional to the material's atomic number. The technique may thus also allow for element mapping and for soft-tissue differentiation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00953-8"
"natbiomedeng","Fast and scalable search of whole-slide images via self-supervised deep learning","The adoption of digital pathology has enabled the curation of large repositories of gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). Computationally identifying WSIs with similar morphologic features within large repositories without requiring supervised training can have significant applications. However, the retrieval speeds of algorithms for searching similar WSIs often scale with the repository size, which limits their clinical and research potential. Here we show that self-supervised deep learning can be leveraged to search for and retrieve WSIs at speeds that are independent of repository size. The algorithm, which we named SISH (for self-supervised image search for histology) and provide as an open-source package, requires only slide-level annotations for training, encodes WSIs into meaningful discrete latent representations and leverages a tree data structure for fast searching followed by an uncertainty-based ranking algorithm for WSI retrieval. We evaluated SISH on multiple tasks (including retrieval tasks based on tissue-patch queries) and on datasets spanning over 22,000 patient cases and 56 disease subtypes. SISH can also be used to aid the diagnosis of rare cancer types for which the number of available WSIs is often insufficient to train supervised deep-learning models.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00929-8"
"natbiomedeng","A humanized minipig model for the toxicological testing of therapeutic recombinant antibodies","The safety of most human recombinant proteins can be evaluated in transgenic mice tolerant to specific human proteins. However, owing to insufficient genetic diversity and to fundamental differences in immune mechanisms, small-animal models of human diseases are often unsuitable for immunogenicity testing and for predicting adverse outcomes in human patients. Most human therapeutic antibodies trigger xenogeneic responses in wild-type animals and thus rapid clearance of the drugs, which makes in vivo toxicological testing of human antibodies challenging. Here we report the generation of Göttingen minipigs carrying a mini-repertoire of human genes for the immunoglobulin heavy chains [gamma]1 and [gamma]4 and the immunoglobulin light chain [kappa]. In line with observations in human patients, the genetically modified minipigs tolerated the clinically non-immunogenic IgG1[kappa]-isotype monoclonal antibodies daratumumab and bevacizumab, and elicited antibodies against the checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab and the engineered interleukin cergutuzumab amunaleukin. The humanized minipigs can facilitate the safety and efficacy testing of therapeutic antibodies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00921-2"

Yet such a high-level of performance typically requires that the models be trained with relevant datasets that have been painstakingly annotated by experts. Here we show that a self-supervised model trained on chest X-ray images that lack explicit annotations performs pathology-classification tasks with accuracies comparable to those of radiologists. On an external validation dataset of chest X-rays, the self-supervised model outperformed a fully supervised model in the detection of three pathologies (out of eight), and the performance generalized to pathologies that were not explicitly annotated for model training, to multiple image-interpretation tasks and to datasets from multiple institutions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00936-9"
"natbiomedeng","Diagnosis of paediatric tuberculosis by optically detecting two virulence factors on extracellular vesicles in blood samples","Sensitive and specific blood-based assays for the detection of pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis would reduce mortality associated with missed diagnoses, particularly in children. Here we report a nanoparticle-enhanced immunoassay read by dark-field microscopy that detects two Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence factors (the glycolipid lipoarabinomannan and its carrier protein) on the surface of circulating extracellular vesicles. In a cohort study of 147 hospitalized and severely immunosuppressed children living with HIV, the assay detected 58 of the 78 (74%) cases of paediatric tuberculosis, 48 of the 66 (73%) cases that were missed by microbiological assays, and 8 out of 10 (80%) cases undiagnosed during the study. It also distinguished tuberculosis from latent-tuberculosis infections in non-human primates. We adapted the assay to make it portable and operable by a smartphone. With further development, the assay may facilitate the detection of tuberculosis at the point of care, particularly in resource-limited settings.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00922-1"

"natbiomedeng","Efficient in vivo base editing via single adeno-associated viruses with size-optimized genomes encoding compact adenine base editors","The viral delivery of base editors has been complicated by their size and by the limited packaging capacity of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs). Typically, dual-AAV approaches based on trans-splicing inteins have been used. Here we show that, compared with dual-AAV systems, AAVs with size-optimized genomes incorporating compact adenine base editors (ABEs) enable efficient editing in mice at similar or lower doses. Single-AAV-encoded ABEs retro-orbitally injected in mice led to editing efficiencies in liver (66%), heart (33%) and muscle (22%) tissues that were up to 2.5-fold those of dual-AAV ABE8e, and to a 93% knockdown (on average) of human PCSK9 and of mouse Pcsk9 and Angptl3 in circulation, concomitant with substantial reductions of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides. Moreover, three size-minimized ABE8e variants, each compatible with single-AAV delivery, collectively offer compatibility with protospacer-adjacent motifs for editing approximately 82% of the adenines in the human genome. ABEs encoded within single AAVs will facilitate research and therapeutic applications of base editing by simplifying AAV production and characterization, and by reducing the dose required for the desired level of editing.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00911-4"
"natbiomedeng","Nutritional deficiency in an intestine-on-a-chip recapitulates injury hallmarks associated with environmental enteric dysfunction","Environmental enteric dysfunction (EED)-a chronic inflammatory condition of the intestine-is characterized by villus blunting, compromised intestinal barrier function and reduced nutrient absorption. Here we show that essential genotypic and phenotypic features of EED-associated intestinal injury can be reconstituted in a human intestine-on-a-chip lined by organoid-derived intestinal epithelial cells from patients with EED and cultured in nutrient-deficient medium lacking niacinamide and tryptophan. Exposure of the organ chip to such nutritional deficiencies resulted in congruent changes in six of the top ten upregulated genes that were comparable to changes seen in samples from patients with EED. Chips lined with healthy epithelium or with EED epithelium exposed to nutritional deficiencies resulted in severe villus blunting and barrier dysfunction, and in the impairment of fatty acid uptake and amino acid transport; and the chips with EED epithelium exhibited heightened secretion of inflammatory cytokines. The organ-chip model of EED‐associated intestinal injury may facilitate the analysis of the molecular, genetic and nutritional bases of the disease and the testing of candidate therapeutics for it.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00899-x"
"natbiomedeng","CAR T cells expressing a bacterial virulence factor trigger potent bystander antitumour responses in solid cancers","Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR T cells) are effective against haematologic malignancies. However, in solid tumours, their potency is hampered by local immunosuppression and by the heterogeneous expression of the antigen that the CAR targets. Here we show that CAR T cells expressing a pluripotent pro-inflammatory neutrophil-activating protein (NAP) from Helicobacter pylori trigger endogenous bystander T-cell responses against solid cancers. In mice with subcutaneous murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, neuroblastomas or colon carcinomas, CAR(NAP) T cells led to slower tumour growth and higher survival rates than conventional mouse CAR T cells, regardless of target antigen, tumour type and host haplotype. In tumours with heterogeneous antigen expression, NAP secretion induced the formation of an immunologically 'hot' microenvironment that supported dendritic cell maturation and bystander responses, as indicated by epitope spreading and infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells targeting tumour-associated antigens other than the CAR-targeted antigen. CAR T cells armed with NAP neither increased off-tumour toxicity nor hampered the efficacy of CAR T cells, and hence may have advantageous translational potential.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00875-5"
"natbiomedeng","A wireless millimetric magnetoelectric implant for the endovascular stimulation of peripheral nerves","Implantable bioelectronic devices for the simulation of peripheral nerves could be used to treat disorders that are resistant to traditional pharmacological therapies. However, for many nerve targets, this requires invasive surgeries and the implantation of bulky devices (about a few centimetres in at least one dimension). Here we report the design and in vivo proof-of-concept testing of an endovascular wireless and battery-free millimetric implant for the stimulation of specific peripheral nerves that are difficult to reach via traditional surgeries. The device can be delivered through a percutaneous catheter and leverages magnetoelectric materials to receive data and power through tissue via a digitally programmable 1 mm × 0.8 mm system-on-a-chip. Implantation of the device directly on top of the sciatic nerve in rats and near a femoral artery in pigs (with a stimulation lead introduced into a blood vessel through a catheter) allowed for wireless stimulation of the animals' sciatic and femoral nerves. Minimally invasive magnetoelectric implants may allow for the stimulation of nerves without the need for open surgery or the implantation of battery-powered pulse generators.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00873-7"
"natbiomedeng","Screening for modulators of the cellular composition of gut epithelia via organoid models of intestinal stem cell differentiation","The cellular composition of barrier epithelia is essential to organismal homoeostasis. In particular, within the small intestine, adult stem cells establish tissue cellularity, and may provide a means to control the abundance and quality of specialized epithelial cells. Yet, methods for the identification of biological targets regulating epithelial composition and function, and of small molecules modulating them, are lacking. Here we show that druggable biological targets and small-molecule regulators of intestinal stem cell differentiation can be identified via multiplexed phenotypic screening using thousands of miniaturized organoid models of intestinal stem cell differentiation into Paneth cells, and validated via longitudinal single-cell RNA-sequencing. We found that inhibitors of the nuclear exporter Exportin 1 modulate the fate of intestinal stem cells, independently of known differentiation cues, significantly increasing the abundance of Paneth cells in the organoids and in wild-type mice. Physiological organoid models of the differentiation of intestinal stem cells could find broader utility for the screening of biological targets and small molecules that can modulate the composition and function of other barrier epithelia.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00863-9"
"natbiomedeng","Multi-arm RNA junctions encoding molecular logic unconstrained by input sequence for versatile cell-free diagnostics","Applications of RNA-based molecular logic have been hampered by sequence constraints imposed on the input and output of the circuits. Here we show that the sequence constraints can be substantially reduced by appropriately encoded multi-arm junctions of single-stranded RNA structures. To conditionally activate RNA translation, we integrated multi-arm junctions, self-assembled upstream of a regulated gene and designed to unfold sequentially in response to different RNA inputs, with motifs of loop-initiated RNA activators that function independently of the sequence of the input RNAs and that reduce interference with the output gene. We used the integrated RNA system and sequence-independent input RNAs to execute two-input and three-input OR and AND logic in Escherichia coli, and designed paper-based cell-free colourimetric assays that accurately identified two human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) subtypes (by executing OR logic) in amplified synthetic HIV RNA as well as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (via two-input AND logic) in amplified RNA from saliva samples. The sequence-independent molecular logic enabled by the integration of multi-arm junction RNAs with motifs for loop-initiated RNA activators may be broadly applicable in biotechnology.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00857-7"
"natbiomedeng","Field validation of the performance of paper-based tests for the detection of the Zika and chikungunya viruses in serum samples","In low-resource settings, resilience to infectious disease outbreaks can be hindered by limited access to diagnostic tests. Here we report the results of double-blinded studies of the performance of paper-based diagnostic tests for the Zika and chikungunya viruses in a field setting in Latin America. The tests involved a cell-free expression system relying on isothermal amplification and toehold-switch reactions, a purpose-built portable reader and onboard software for computer vision-enabled image analysis. In patients suspected of infection, the accuracies and sensitivities of the tests for the Zika and chikungunya viruses were, respectively, 98.5% (95% confidence interval, 96.2-99.6%, 268 serum samples) and 98.5% (95% confidence interval, 91.7-100%, 65 serum samples) and approximately 2 aM and 5 fM (both concentrations are within clinically relevant ranges). The analytical specificities and sensitivities of the tests for cultured samples of the viruses were equivalent to those of the real-time quantitative PCR. Cell-free synthetic biology tools and companion hardware can provide de-centralized, high-capacity and low-cost diagnostics for use in low-resource settings.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00850-0"
"natbiomedeng","In vivo lensless microscopy via a phase mask generating diffraction patterns with high-contrast contours","The simple and compact optics of lensless microscopes and the associated computational algorithms allow for large fields of view and the refocusing of the captured images. However, existing lensless techniques cannot accurately reconstruct the typical low-contrast images of optically dense biological tissue. Here we show that lensless imaging of tissue in vivo can be achieved via an optical phase mask designed to create a point spread function consisting of high-contrast contours with a broad spectrum of spatial frequencies. We built a prototype lensless microscope incorporating the 'contour' phase mask and used it to image calcium dynamics in the cortex of live mice (over a field of view of about 16 mm2) and in freely moving Hydra vulgaris, as well as microvasculature in the oral mucosa of volunteers. The low cost, small form factor and computational refocusing capability of in vivo lensless microscopy may open it up to clinical uses, especially for imaging difficult-to-reach areas of the body.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-022-00851-z"
"natbiomedeng","Amelioration of Alzheimer's disease pathology by mitophagy inducers identified via machine learning and a cross-species workflow","A reduced removal of dysfunctional mitochondria is common to aging and age-related neurodegenerative pathologies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Strategies for treating such impaired mitophagy would benefit from the identification of mitophagy modulators. Here we report the combined use of unsupervised machine learning (involving vector representations of molecular structures, pharmacophore fingerprinting and conformer fingerprinting) and a cross-species approach for the screening and experimental validation of new mitophagy-inducing compounds. From a library of naturally occurring compounds, the workflow allowed us to identify 18 small molecules, and among them two potent mitophagy inducers (Kaempferol and Rhapontigenin). In nematode and rodent models of AD, we show that both mitophagy inducers increased the survival and functionality of glutamatergic and cholinergic neurons, abrogated amyloid-[beta] and tau pathologies, and improved the animals' memory. Our findings suggest the existence of a conserved mechanism of memory loss across the AD models, this mechanism being mediated by defective mitophagy. The computational-experimental screening and validation workflow might help uncover potent mitophagy modulators that stimulate neuronal health and brain homeostasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-021-00819-5"

"natbiomedeng","Prolonged activation of innate immune pathways by a polyvalent STING agonist","The stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane protein that is a target of therapeutics for infectious diseases and cancer. However, early-phase clinical trials of small-molecule STING agonists have shown limited antitumour efficacy and dose-limiting toxicity. Here, we show that a polyvalent STING agonist-a pH-sensitive polymer bearing a seven-membered ring with a tertiary amine (PC7A)-activates innate-immunity pathways through the polymer-induced formation of STING-PC7A condensates. In contrast to the natural STING ligand 2',3'-cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP), PC7A stimulates the prolonged production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by binding to a non-competitive STING surface site that is distinct from the cGAMP binding pocket. PC7A induces antitumour responses that are dependent on STING expression and CD8+ T-cell activity, and the combination of PC7A and cGAMP led to synergistic therapeutic outcomes (including the activation of cGAMP-resistant STING variants) in mice bearing subcutaneous tumours and in resected human tumours and lymph nodes. The activation of the STING pathway through polymer-induced STING condensation may offer new therapeutic opportunities.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00675-9"

Here, we describe an open resource containing data from 1,521 patients with pneumonia (including COVID-19 pneumonia) consisting of chest computed tomography (CT) images, 130 clinical features (from a range of biochemical and cellular analyses of blood and urine samples) and laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) clinical status. We show the utility of the database for prediction of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality outcomes using a deep learning algorithm trained with data from 1,170 patients and 19,685 manually labelled CT slices. In an independent validation cohort of 351 patients, the algorithm discriminated between negative, mild and severe cases with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.944, 0.860 and 0.884, respectively. The open database may have further uses in the diagnosis and management of patients with COVID-19.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00633-5"
"natbiomedeng","Design and clinical implementation of an open-source bionic leg","In individuals with lower-limb amputations, robotic prostheses can increase walking speed, and reduce energy use, the incidence of falls and the development of secondary complications. However, safe and reliable prosthetic-limb control strategies for robust ambulation in real-world settings remain out of reach, partly because control strategies have been tested with different robotic hardware in constrained laboratory settings. Here, we report the design and clinical implementation of an integrated robotic knee-ankle prosthesis that facilitates the real-world testing of its biomechanics and control strategies. The bionic leg is open source, it includes software for low-level control and for communication with control systems, and its hardware design is customizable, enabling reduction in its mass and cost, improvement in its ease of use and independent operation of the knee and ankle joints. We characterized the electromechanical and thermal performance of the bionic leg in benchtop testing, as well as its kinematics and kinetics in three individuals during walking on level ground, ramps and stairs. The open-source integrated-hardware solution and benchmark data that we provide should help with research and clinical testing of knee-ankle prostheses in real-world environments.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00619-3"
