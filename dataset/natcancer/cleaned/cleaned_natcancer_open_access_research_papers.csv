"natcancer","Interferon signaling promotes tolerance to chromosomal instability during metastatic evolution in renal cancer","Molecular routes to metastatic dissemination are critical determinants of aggressive cancers. Through in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we generated somatic mosaic genetically engineered models that faithfully recapitulate metastatic renal tumors. Disruption of 9p21 locus is an evolutionary driver to systemic disease through the rapid acquisition of complex karyotypes in cancer cells. Cross-species analysis revealed that recurrent patterns of copy number variations, including 21q loss and dysregulation of the interferon pathway, are major drivers of metastatic potential. In vitro and in vivo genomic engineering, leveraging loss-of-function studies, along with a model of partial trisomy of chromosome 21q, demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect of the interferon receptor genes cluster as an adaptive mechanism to deleterious chromosomal instability in metastatic progression. This work provides critical knowledge on drivers of renal cell carcinoma progression and defines the primary role of interferon signaling in constraining the propagation of aneuploid clones in cancer evolution.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00584-1"
"natcancer","High-plex immunofluorescence imaging and traditional histology of the same tissue section for discovering image-based biomarkers","Precision medicine is critically dependent on better methods for diagnosing and staging disease and predicting drug response. Histopathology using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue (not genomics) remains the primary diagnostic method in cancer. Recently developed highly multiplexed tissue imaging methods promise to enhance research studies and clinical practice with precise, spatially resolved single-cell data. Here, we describe the 'Orion' platform for collecting H&E and high-plex immunofluorescence images from the same cells in a whole-slide format suitable for diagnosis. Using a retrospective cohort of 74 colorectal cancer resections, we show that immunofluorescence and H&E images provide human experts and machine learning algorithms with complementary information that can be used to generate interpretable, multiplexed image-based models predictive of progression-free survival. Combining models of immune infiltration and tumor-intrinsic features achieves a 10- to 20-fold discrimination between rapid and slow (or no) progression, demonstrating the ability of multimodal tissue imaging to generate high-performance biomarkers.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00576-1"
"natcancer","An allosteric pan-TEAD inhibitor blocks oncogenic YAP/TAZ signaling and overcomes KRAS G12C inhibitor resistance","The Hippo pathway is a key growth control pathway that is conserved across species. The downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway, YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif), are frequently activated in cancers to drive proliferation and survival. Based on the premise that sustained interactions between YAP/TAZ and TEADs (transcriptional enhanced associate domain) are central to their transcriptional activities, we discovered a potent small-molecule inhibitor (SMI), GNE-7883, that allosterically blocks the interactions between YAP/TAZ and all human TEAD paralogs through binding to the TEAD lipid pocket. GNE-7883 effectively reduces chromatin accessibility specifically at TEAD motifs, suppresses cell proliferation in a variety of cell line models and achieves strong antitumor efficacy in vivo. Furthermore, we uncovered that GNE-7883 effectively overcomes both intrinsic and acquired resistance to KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) G12C inhibitors in diverse preclinical models through the inhibition of YAP/TAZ activation. Taken together, this work demonstrates the activities of TEAD SMIs in YAP/TAZ-dependent cancers and highlights their potential broad applications in precision oncology and therapy resistance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00577-0"
"natcancer","Tumor-intrinsic sensitivity to the pro-apoptotic effects of IFN-[gamma] is a major determinant of CD4+ CAR T-cell antitumor activity","CD4+ T cells and CD4+ chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells display highly variable antitumor activity in preclinical models and in patients; however, the mechanisms dictating how and when CD4+ T cells promote tumor regression are incompletely understood. With the help of functional intravital imaging, we report that interferon (IFN)-[gamma] production but not perforin-mediated cytotoxicity was the dominant mechanism for tumor elimination by anti-CD19 CD4+ CAR T cells. Mechanistically, mouse or human CD4+ CAR T-cell-derived IFN-[gamma] diffused extensively to act on tumor cells at distance selectively killing tumors sensitive to cytokine-induced apoptosis, including antigen-negative variants. In anti-CD19 CAR T-cell-treated patients exhibiting elevated CAR CD4:CD8 ratios, strong induction of serum IFN-[gamma] was associated with increased survival. We propose that the sensitivity of tumor cells to the pro-apoptotic activity of IFN-[gamma] is a major determinant of CD4+ CAR T-cell efficacy and may be considered to guide the use of CD4+ T cells during immunotherapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00570-7"
"natcancer","Phenotypic diversity of T cells in human primary and metastatic brain tumors revealed by multiomic interrogation","The immune-specialized environment of the healthy brain is tightly regulated to prevent excessive neuroinflammation. However, after cancer development, a tissue-specific conflict between brain-preserving immune suppression and tumor-directed immune activation may ensue. To interrogate potential roles of T cells in this process, we profiled these cells from individuals with primary or metastatic brain cancers via integrated analyses on the single-cell and bulk population levels. Our analysis revealed similarities and differences in T cell biology between individuals, with the most pronounced differences observed in a subgroup of individuals with brain metastasis, characterized by accumulation of CXCL13-expressing CD39+ potentially tumor-reactive T (pTRT) cells. In this subgroup, high pTRT cell abundance was comparable to that in primary lung cancer, whereas all other brain tumors had low levels, similar to primary breast cancer. These findings indicate that T cell-mediated tumor reactivity can occur in certain brain metastases and may inform stratification for treatment with immunotherapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00566-3"
"natcancer","GAP43-dependent mitochondria transfer from astrocytes enhances glioblastoma tumorigenicity","The transfer of intact mitochondria between heterogeneous cell types has been confirmed in various settings, including cancer. However, the functional implications of mitochondria transfer on tumor biology are poorly understood. Here we show that mitochondria transfer is a prevalent phenomenon in glioblastoma (GBM), the most frequent and malignant primary brain tumor. We identified horizontal mitochondria transfer from astrocytes as a mechanism that enhances tumorigenesis in GBM. This transfer is dependent on network-forming intercellular connections between GBM cells and astrocytes, which are facilitated by growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), a protein involved in neuron axon regeneration and astrocyte reactivity. The acquisition of astrocyte mitochondria drives an increase in mitochondrial respiration and upregulation of metabolic pathways linked to proliferation and tumorigenicity. Functionally, uptake of astrocyte mitochondria promotes cell cycle progression to proliferative G2/M phases and enhances self-renewal and tumorigenicity of GBM. Collectively, our findings reveal a host-tumor interaction that drives proliferation and self-renewal of cancer cells, providing opportunities for therapeutic development.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00556-5"
"natcancer","A sense-antisense RNA interaction promotes breast cancer metastasis via regulation of NQO1 expression","Antisense RNAs are ubiquitous in human cells, yet their role is largely unexplored. Here we profiled antisense RNAs in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line and its highly lung metastatic derivative. We identified one antisense RNA that drives cancer progression by upregulating the redox enzyme NADPH quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1), and named it NQO1-AS. Knockdown of either NQO1 or NQO1-AS reduced lung colonization in a mouse model, and investigation into the role of NQO1 indicated that it is broadly protective against oxidative damage and ferroptosis. Breast cancer cells in the lung are dependent on this pathway, and this dependence can be exploited therapeutically by inducing ferroptosis while inhibiting NQO1. Together, our findings establish a role for NQO1-AS in the progression of breast cancer by regulating its sense mRNA post-transcriptionally. Because breast cancer predominantly affects females, the disease models used in this study are of female origin and the results are primarily applicable to females.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00554-7"
"natcancer","The immunopeptidome landscape associated with T cell infiltration, inflammation and immune editing in lung cancer","One key barrier to improving efficacy of personalized cancer immunotherapies that are dependent on the tumor antigenic landscape remains patient stratification. Although patients with CD3+CD8+ T cell-inflamed tumors typically show better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors, it is still unknown whether the immunopeptidome repertoire presented in highly inflamed and noninflamed tumors is substantially different. We surveyed 61 tumor regions and adjacent nonmalignant lung tissues from 8 patients with lung cancer and performed deep antigen discovery combining immunopeptidomics, genomics, bulk and spatial transcriptomics, and explored the heterogeneous expression and presentation of tumor (neo)antigens. In the present study, we associated diverse immune cell populations with the immunopeptidome and found a relatively higher frequency of predicted neoantigens located within HLA-I presentation hotspots in CD3+CD8+ T cell-excluded tumors. We associated such neoantigens with immune recognition, supporting their involvement in immune editing. This could have implications for the choice of combination therapies tailored to the patient's mutanome and immune microenvironment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00548-5"
"natcancer","Ex vivo drug response heterogeneity reveals personalized therapeutic strategies for patients with multiple myeloma","Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy defined by complex genetics and extensive patient heterogeneity. Despite a growing arsenal of approved therapies, MM remains incurable and in need of guidelines to identify effective personalized treatments. Here, we survey the ex vivo drug and immunotherapy sensitivities across 101 bone marrow samples from 70 patients with MM using multiplexed immunofluorescence, automated microscopy and deep-learning-based single-cell phenotyping. Combined with sample-matched genetics, proteotyping and cytokine profiling, we map the molecular regulatory network of drug sensitivity, implicating the DNA repair pathway and EYA3 expression in proteasome inhibitor sensitivity and major histocompatibility complex class II expression in the response to elotuzumab. Globally, ex vivo drug sensitivity associated with bone marrow microenvironmental signatures reflecting treatment stage, clonality and inflammation. Furthermore, ex vivo drug sensitivity significantly stratified clinical treatment responses, including to immunotherapy. Taken together, our study provides molecular and actionable insights into diverse treatment strategies for patients with MM.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00544-9"
"natcancer","CD103+ regulatory T cells underlie resistance to radio-immunotherapy and impair CD8+ T cell activation in glioblastoma","Glioblastomas are aggressive primary brain tumors with an inherent resistance to T cell-centric immunotherapy due to their low mutational burden and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Here we report that fractionated radiotherapy of preclinical glioblastoma models induce a tenfold increase in T cell content. Orthogonally, spatial imaging mass cytometry shows T cell enrichment in human recurrent tumors compared with matched primary glioblastoma. In glioblastoma-bearing mice, [alpha]-PD-1 treatment applied at the peak of T cell infiltration post-radiotherapy results in a modest survival benefit compared with concurrent [alpha]-PD-1 administration. Following [alpha]-PD-1 therapy, CD103+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) with upregulated lipid metabolism accumulate in the tumor microenvironment, and restrain immune checkpoint blockade response by repressing CD8+ T cell activation. Treg targeting elicits tertiary lymphoid structure formation, enhances CD4+ and CD8+ T cell frequency and function and unleashes radio-immunotherapeutic efficacy. These results support the rational design of therapeutic regimens limiting the induction of immunosuppressive feedback pathways in the context of T cell immunotherapy in glioblastoma.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00547-6"
"natcancer","Inferring early genetic progression in cancers with unobtainable premalignant disease","Analysis of premalignant tissue has identified the typical order of somatic events leading to invasive tumors in several cancer types. For other cancers, premalignant tissue is unobtainable, leaving genetic progression unknown. Here, we demonstrate how to infer progression from exome sequencing of primary tumors. Our computational method, PhylogicNDT, recapitulated the previous experimentally determined genetic progression of human papillomavirus-negative (HPV-) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We then evaluated HPV+ HNSCC, which lacks premalignant tissue, and uncovered its previously unknown progression, identifying early drivers. We converted relative timing estimates of driver mutations and HPV integration to years before diagnosis based on a clock-like mutational signature. We associated the timing of transitions to aneuploidy with increased intratumor genetic heterogeneity and shorter overall survival. Our approach can establish previously unknown early genetic progression of cancers with unobtainable premalignant tissue, supporting development of experimental models and methods for early detection, interception and prognostication.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00533-y"
"natcancer","PD-L1 blockade in combination with carboplatin as immune induction in metastatic lobular breast cancer: the GELATO trial","Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) is the second most common histological breast cancer subtype, but ILC-specific trials are lacking. Translational research revealed an immune-related ILC subset, and in mouse ILC models, synergy between immune checkpoint blockade and platinum was observed. In the phase II GELATO trial (NCT03147040), patients with metastatic ILC were treated with weekly carboplatin (area under the curve 1.5 mg ml-1 min-1) as immune induction for 12 weeks and atezolizumab (PD-L1 blockade; triweekly) from the third week until progression. Four of 23 evaluable patients had a partial response (17%), and 2 had stable disease, resulting in a clinical benefit rate of 26%. From these six patients, four had triple-negative ILC (TN-ILC). We observed higher CD8+ T cell infiltration, immune checkpoint expression and exhausted T cells after treatment. With this GELATO trial, we show that ILC-specific clinical trials are feasible and demonstrate promising antitumor activity of atezolizumab with carboplatin, particularly for TN-ILC, and provide insights for the design of highly needed ILC-specific trials.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00542-x"
"natcancer","Multimodal immunogenomic biomarker analysis of tumors from pediatric patients enrolled to a phase 1-2 study of single-agent atezolizumab","We report herein an exploratory biomarker analysis of refractory tumors collected from pediatric patients before atezolizumab therapy (iMATRIX-atezolizumab, NCT02541604). Elevated levels of CD8+ T cells and PD-L1 were associated with progression-free survival and a diverse baseline infiltrating T-cell receptor repertoire was prognostic. Differential gene expression analysis revealed elevated expression of CALCA (preprocalcitonin) and CCDC183 (highly expressed in testes) in patients who experienced clinical activity, suggesting that tumor neoantigens from these genes may contribute to immune response. In patients who experienced partial response or stable disease, elevated Ig[alpha]2 expression correlated with T- and B-cell infiltration, suggesting that tertiary lymphoid structures existed in these patients' tumors. Consensus gene co-expression network analysis identified core cellular pathways that may play a role in antitumor immunity. Our study uncovers features associated with response to immune-checkpoint inhibition in pediatric patients with cancer and provides biological and translational insights to guide prospective biomarker profiling in future clinical trials.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00534-x"
"natcancer","Precision-activated T-cell engagers targeting HER2 or EGFR and CD3 mitigate on-target, off-tumor toxicity for immunotherapy in solid tumors","To enhance the therapeutic index of T-cell engagers (TCEs), we engineered masked, precision-activated TCEs (XPAT proteins), targeting a tumor antigen (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)) and CD3. Unstructured XTEN polypeptide masks flank the N and C termini of the TCE and are designed to be released by proteases in the tumor microenvironment. In vitro, unmasked HER2-XPAT (uTCE) demonstrates potent cytotoxicity, with XTEN polypeptide masking providing up to 4-log-fold protection. In vivo, HER2-XPAT protein induces protease-dependent antitumor activity and is proteolytically stable in healthy tissues. In non-human primates, HER2-XPAT protein demonstrates a strong safety margin (>400-fold increase in tolerated maximum concentration versus uTCE). HER2-XPAT protein cleavage is low and similar in plasma samples from healthy and diseased humans and non-human primates, supporting translatability of stability to patients. EGFR-XPAT protein confirmed the utility of XPAT technology for tumor targets more widely expressed in healthy tissues.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00536-9"
"natcancer","Apoptosis-induced nuclear expulsion in tumor cells drives S100a4-mediated metastatic outgrowth through the RAGE pathway","Most tumor cells undergo apoptosis in circulation and at the metastatic organ sites due to host immune surveillance and a hostile microenvironment. It remains to be elucidated whether dying tumor cells have a direct effect on live tumor cells during the metastatic process and what the underlying mechanisms are. Here we report that apoptotic cancer cells enhance the metastatic outgrowth of surviving cells through Padi4-mediated nuclear expulsion. Tumor cell nuclear expulsion results in an extracellular DNA-protein complex that is enriched with receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) ligands. The chromatin-bound RAGE ligand S100a4 activates RAGE receptors in neighboring surviving tumor cells, leading to Erk activation. In addition, we identified nuclear expulsion products in human patients with breast, bladder and lung cancer and a nuclear expulsion signature correlated with poor prognosis. Collectively, our study demonstrates how apoptotic cell death can enhance the metastatic outgrowth of neighboring live tumor cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00524-z"
"natcancer","Age-associated microenvironmental changes highlight the role of PDGF-C in ER+ breast cancer metastatic relapse","Patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer are at risk of metastatic relapse for decades after primary tumor resection and treatment, a consequence of dormant disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) reawakening at secondary sites. Here we use syngeneic ER+ mouse models in which DTCs display a dormant phenotype in young mice but accelerated metastatic outgrowth in an aged or fibrotic microenvironment. In young mice, low-level Pdgfc expression by ER+ DTCs is required for their maintenance in secondary sites but is insufficient to support development of macrometastases. By contrast, the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-Chi environment of aging or fibrotic lungs promotes DTC proliferation and upregulates tumor cell Pdgfc expression stimulating further stromal activation, events that can be blocked by pharmacological inhibition of PDGFR[alpha] or with a PDGF-C-blocking antibody. These results highlight the role of the changing microenvironment in regulating DTC outgrowth and the opportunity to target PDGF-C signaling to limit metastatic relapse in ER+ breast cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00525-y"
"natcancer","Disrupting the phase separation of KAT8-IRF1 diminishes PD-L1 expression and promotes antitumor immunity","Immunotherapies targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have become first-line treatments in multiple cancers. However, only a limited subset of individuals achieves durable benefits because of the elusive mechanisms regulating PD-1/PD-L1. Here, we report that in cells exposed to interferon-[gamma] (IFN[gamma]), KAT8 undergoes phase separation with induced IRF1 and forms biomolecular condensates to upregulate PD-L1. Multivalency from both the specific and promiscuous interactions between IRF1 and KAT8 is required for condensate formation. KAT8-IRF1 condensation promotes IRF1 K78 acetylation and binding to the CD247 (PD-L1) promoter and further enriches the transcription apparatus to promote transcription of PD-L1 mRNA. Based on the mechanism of KAT8-IRF1 condensate formation, we identified the 2142-R8 blocking peptide, which disrupts KAT8-IRF1 condensate formation and consequently inhibits PD-L1 expression and enhances antitumor immunity in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal a key role of KAT8-IRF1 condensates in PD-L1 regulation and provide a competitive peptide to enhance antitumor immune responses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-023-00522-1"
"natcancer","A reversible SRC-relayed COX2 inflammatory program drives resistance to BRAF and EGFR inhibition in BRAFV600E colorectal tumors","BRAFV600E mutation confers a poor prognosis in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) despite combinatorial targeted therapies based on the latest understanding of signaling circuitry. To identify parallel resistance mechanisms induced by BRAF-MEK-EGFR co-targeting, we used a high-throughput kinase activity mapping platform. Here we show that SRC kinases are systematically activated in BRAFV600E CRC following targeted inhibition of BRAF +/- EGFR and that coordinated targeting of SRC with BRAF +/- EGFR increases treatment efficacy in vitro and in vivo. SRC drives resistance to BRAF +/- EGFR targeted therapy independently of ERK signaling by inducing transcriptional reprogramming through [beta]-catenin (CTNNB1). The EGFR-independent compensatory activation of SRC kinases is mediated by an autocrine prostaglandin E2 loop that can be blocked with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibitors. Co-targeting of COX2 with BRAF + EGFR promotes durable suppression of tumor growth in patient-derived tumor xenograft models. COX2 inhibition represents a drug-repurposing strategy to overcome therapeutic resistance in BRAFV600E CRC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00508-5"
"natcancer","Integrative multi-omics networks identify PKC[delta] and DNA-PK as master kinases of glioblastoma subtypes and guide targeted cancer therapy","Despite producing a panoply of potential cancer-specific targets, the proteogenomic characterization of human tumors has yet to demonstrate value for precision cancer medicine. Integrative multi-omics using a machine-learning network identified master kinases responsible for effecting phenotypic hallmarks of functional glioblastoma subtypes. In subtype-matched patient-derived models, we validated PKC[delta] and DNA-PK as master kinases of glycolytic/plurimetabolic and proliferative/progenitor subtypes, respectively, and qualified the kinases as potent and actionable glioblastoma subtype-specific therapeutic targets. Glioblastoma subtypes were associated with clinical and radiomics features, orthogonally validated by proteomics, phospho-proteomics, metabolomics, lipidomics and acetylomics analyses, and recapitulated in pediatric glioma, breast and lung squamous cell carcinoma, including subtype specificity of PKC[delta] and DNA-PK activity. We developed a probabilistic classification tool that performs optimally with RNA from frozen and paraffin-embedded tissues, which can be used to evaluate the association of therapeutic response with glioblastoma subtypes and to inform patient selection in prospective clinical trials.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00510-x"
"natcancer","Comprehensive analysis of mutational signatures reveals distinct patterns and molecular processes across 27 pediatric cancers","Analysis of mutational signatures can reveal underlying molecular mechanisms of the processes that have imprinted the somatic mutations found in cancer genomes. Here, we analyze single base substitutions and small insertions and deletions in pediatric cancers encompassing 785 whole-genome sequenced tumors from 27 molecularly defined cancer subtypes. We identified only a small number of mutational signatures active in pediatric cancers, compared with previously analyzed adult cancers. Further, we report a significant difference in the proportion of pediatric tumors showing homologous recombination repair defect signatures compared with previous analyses. In pediatric leukemias, we identified an indel signature, not previously reported, characterized by long insertions in nonrepeat regions, affecting mainly intronic and intergenic regions, but also exons of known cancer genes. We provide a systematic overview of COSMIC v.3 mutational signatures active across pediatric cancers, which is highly relevant for understanding tumor biology and enabling future research in defining biomarkers of treatment response.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00509-4"
"natcancer","Fucosylation of HLA-DRB1 regulates CD4+ T cell-mediated anti-melanoma immunity and enhances immunotherapy efficacy","Immunotherapy efficacy is limited in melanoma, and combinations of immunotherapies with other modalities have yielded limited improvements but also adverse events requiring cessation of treatment. In addition to ineffective patient stratification, efficacy is impaired by paucity of intratumoral immune cells (itICs); thus, effective strategies to safely increase itICs are needed. We report that dietary administration of l-fucose induces fucosylation and cell surface enrichment of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II protein HLA-DRB1 in melanoma cells, triggering CD4+ T cell-mediated increases in itICs and anti-tumor immunity, enhancing immune checkpoint blockade responses. Melanoma fucosylation and fucosylated HLA-DRB1 associate with intratumoral T cell abundance and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) responder status in patient melanoma specimens, suggesting the potential use of melanoma fucosylation as a strategy for stratifying patients for immunotherapies. Our findings demonstrate that fucosylation is a key mediator of anti-tumor immunity and, importantly, suggest that l-fucose is a powerful agent for safely increasing itICs and immunotherapy efficacy in melanoma.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00506-7"
"natcancer","The clinical utility of integrative genomics in childhood cancer extends beyond targetable mutations","We conducted integrative somatic-germline analyses by deeply sequencing 864 cancer-associated genes, complete genomes and transcriptomes for 300 mostly previously treated children and adolescents/young adults with cancer of poor prognosis or with rare tumors enrolled in the SickKids Cancer Sequencing (KiCS) program. Clinically actionable variants were identified in 56% of patients. Improved diagnostic accuracy led to modified management in a subset. Therapeutically targetable variants (54% of patients) were of unanticipated timing and type, with over 20% derived from the germline. Corroborating mutational signatures (SBS3/BRCAness) in patients with germline homologous recombination defects demonstrates the potential utility of PARP inhibitors. Mutational burden was significantly elevated in 9% of patients. Sequential sampling identified changes in therapeutically targetable drivers in over one-third of patients, suggesting benefit from rebiopsy for genomic analysis at the time of relapse. Comprehensive cancer genomic profiling is useful at multiple points in the care trajectory for children and adolescents/young adults with cancer, supporting its integration into early clinical management.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00474-y"
"natcancer","Multiomics in primary and metastatic breast tumors from the AURORA US network finds microenvironment and epigenetic drivers of metastasis","The AURORA US Metastasis Project was established with the goal to identify molecular features associated with metastasis. We assayed 55 females with metastatic breast cancer (51 primary cancers and 102 metastases) by RNA sequencing, tumor/germline DNA exome and low-pass whole-genome sequencing and global DNA methylation microarrays. Expression subtype changes were observed in ~30% of samples and were coincident with DNA clonality shifts, especially involving HER2. Downregulation of estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated cell-cell adhesion genes through DNA methylation mechanisms was observed in metastases. Microenvironment differences varied according to tumor subtype; the ER+/luminal subtype had lower fibroblast and endothelial content, while triple-negative breast cancer/basal metastases showed a decrease in B and T cells. In 17% of metastases, DNA hypermethylation and/or focal deletions were identified near HLA-A and were associated with reduced expression and lower immune cell infiltrates, especially in brain and liver metastases. These findings could have implications for treating individuals with metastatic breast cancer with immune- and HER2-targeting therapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00491-x"
"natcancer","Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody-containing plasma improves outcome in patients with hematologic or solid cancer and severe COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial","Patients with cancer are at high risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), with high morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, impaired humoral response renders severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccines less effective and treatment options are scarce. Randomized trials using convalescent plasma are missing for high-risk patients. Here, we performed a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial (https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2020-001632-10/DE) in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 (n = 134) within four risk groups ((1) cancer (n = 56); (2) immunosuppression (n = 16); (3) laboratory-based risk factors (n = 36); and (4) advanced age (n = 26)) randomized to standard of care (control arm) or standard of care plus convalescent/vaccinated anti-SARS-CoV-2 plasma (plasma arm). No serious adverse events were observed related to the plasma treatment. Clinical improvement as the primary outcome was assessed using a seven-point ordinal scale. Secondary outcomes were time to discharge and overall survival. For the four groups combined, those receiving plasma did not improve clinically compared with those in the control arm (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.29; P = 0.205). However, patients with cancer experienced a shortened median time to improvement (HR = 2.50; P = 0.003) and superior survival with plasma treatment versus the control arm (HR = 0.28; P = 0.042). Neutralizing antibody activity increased in the plasma cohort but not in the control cohort of patients with cancer (P = 0.001). Taken together, convalescent/vaccinated plasma may improve COVID-19 outcomes in patients with cancer who are unable to intrinsically generate an adequate immune response.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00503-w"

"natcancer","Potent high-avidity neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses after COVID-19 vaccination in individuals with B cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma","Individuals with hematologic malignancies are at increased risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), yet profound analyses of COVID-19 vaccine-induced immunity are scarce. Here we present an observational study with expanded methodological analysis of a longitudinal, primarily BNT162b2 mRNA-vaccinated cohort of 60 infection-naive individuals with B cell lymphomas and multiple myeloma. We show that many of these individuals, despite markedly lower anti-spike IgG titers, rapidly develop potent infection neutralization capacities against several severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variants of concern (VoCs). The observed increased neutralization capacity per anti-spike antibody unit was paralleled by an early step increase in antibody avidity between the second and third vaccination. All individuals with hematologic malignancies, including those depleted of B cells and individuals with multiple myeloma, exhibited a robust T cell response to peptides derived from the spike protein of VoCs Delta and Omicron (BA.1). Consistently, breakthrough infections were mainly of mild to moderate severity. We conclude that COVID-19 vaccination can induce broad antiviral immunity including ultrapotent neutralizing antibodies with high avidity in different hematologic malignancies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00502-x"
"natcancer","A single-cell atlas of glioblastoma evolution under therapy reveals cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic therapeutic targets","Recent longitudinal studies of glioblastoma (GBM) have demonstrated a lack of apparent selection pressure for specific DNA mutations in recurrent disease. Single-cell lineage tracing has shown that GBM cells possess a high degree of plasticity. Together this suggests that phenotype switching, as opposed to genetic evolution, may be the escape mechanism that explains the failure of precision therapies to date. We profiled 86 primary-recurrent patient-matched paired GBM specimens with single-nucleus RNA, single-cell open-chromatin, DNA and spatial transcriptomic/proteomic assays. We found that recurrent GBMs are characterized by a shift to a mesenchymal phenotype. We show that the mesenchymal state is mediated by activator protein 1. Increased T-cell abundance at recurrence was prognostic and correlated with hypermutation status. We identified tumor-supportive networks of paracrine and autocrine signals between GBM cells, nonmalignant neuroglia and immune cells. We present cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic targets and a single-cell multiomics atlas of GBM under therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00475-x"
"natcancer","Targeting the bicarbonate transporter SLC4A4 overcomes immunosuppression and immunotherapy resistance in pancreatic cancer","Solid tumors are generally characterized by an acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) that favors cancer progression, therapy resistance and immune evasion. By single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis in individuals with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we reveal solute carrier family 4 member 4 (SLC4A4) as the most abundant bicarbonate transporter, predominantly expressed by epithelial ductal cells. Functionally, SLC4A4 inhibition in PDAC cancer cells mitigates the acidosis of the TME due to bicarbonate accumulation in the extracellular space and a decrease in lactate production by cancer cells as the result of reduced glycolysis. In PDAC-bearing mice, genetic or pharmacological SLC4A4 targeting improves T cell-mediated immune response and breaches macrophage-mediated immunosuppression, thus inhibiting tumor growth and metastases.

"natcancer","A phase I/Ib trial and biological correlate analysis of neoadjuvant SBRT with single-dose durvalumab in HPV-unrelated locally advanced HNSCC","Five-year survival for human papilloma virus-unrelated head and neck squamous cell carcinomas remain below 50%. We assessed the safety of administering combination hypofractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy with single-dose durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) neoadjuvantly (n = 21) (NCT03635164). The primary endpoint of the study was safety, which was met. Secondary endpoints included radiographic, pathologic and objective response; locoregional control; progression-free survival; and overall survival. Among evaluable patients at an early median follow-up of 16 months (448 d or 64 weeks), overall survival was 80.1% with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) (62.0%, 100.0%), locoregional control and progression-free survival were 75.8% with 95% CI (57.5%, 99.8%), and major pathological response or complete response was 75% with 95% exact CI (51.6%, 100.0%). For patients treated with 24 Gy, 89% with 95% CI (57.1%, 100.0%) had MPR or CR. Using high-dimensional multi-omics and spatial data as well as biological correlatives, we show that responders had: (1) an increase in effector T cells; (2) a decrease in immunosuppressive cells; and (3) an increase in antigen presentation post-treatment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00450-6"
"natcancer","Radiotherapy in combination with CD47 blockade elicits a macrophage-mediated abscopal effect","Radiation therapy is a mainstay of cancer treatment but does not always lead to complete tumor regression. Here we combine radiotherapy with blockade of the 'don't-eat-me' cell-surface molecule CD47 in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a highly metastatic form of lung cancer. CD47 blockade potently enhances the local antitumor effects of radiotherapy in preclinical models of SCLC. Notably, CD47 blockade also stimulates off-target 'abscopal' effects inhibiting non-irradiated SCLC tumors in mice receiving radiation. These abscopal effects are independent of T cells but require macrophages that migrate into non-irradiated tumor sites in response to inflammatory signals produced by radiation and are locally activated by CD47 blockade to phagocytose cancer cells. Similar abscopal antitumor effects were observed in other cancer models treated with radiation and CD47 blockade. The systemic activation of antitumor macrophages following radiotherapy and CD47 blockade may be particularly important in patients with cancer who suffer from metastatic disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00456-0"
"natcancer","Differential integrated stress response and asparagine production drive symbiosis and therapy resistance of pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells","The pancreatic tumor microenvironment drives deregulated nutrient availability. Accordingly, pancreatic cancer cells require metabolic adaptations to survive and proliferate. Pancreatic cancer subtypes have been characterized by transcriptional and functional differences, with subtypes reported to exist within the same tumor. However, it remains unclear if this diversity extends to metabolic programming. Here, using metabolomic profiling and functional interrogation of metabolic dependencies, we identify two distinct metabolic subclasses among neoplastic populations within individual human and mouse tumors. Furthermore, these populations are poised for metabolic cross-talk, and in examining this, we find an unexpected role for asparagine supporting proliferation during limited respiration. Constitutive GCN2 activation permits ATF4 signaling in one subtype, driving excess asparagine production. Asparagine release provides resistance during impaired respiration, enabling symbiosis. Functionally, availability of exogenous asparagine during limited respiration indirectly supports maintenance of aspartate pools, a rate-limiting biosynthetic precursor. Conversely, depletion of extracellular asparagine with PEG-asparaginase sensitizes tumors to mitochondrial targeting with phenformin.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00463-1"
"natcancer","MACHETE identifies interferon-encompassing chromosome 9p21.3 deletions as mediators of immune evasion and metastasis","The most prominent homozygous deletions in cancer affect chromosome 9p21.3 and eliminate CDKN2A/B tumor suppressors, disabling a cell-intrinsic barrier to tumorigenesis. Half of 9p21.3 deletions, however, also encompass a type I interferon (IFN) gene cluster; the consequences of this co-deletion remain unexplored. To functionally dissect 9p21.3 and other large genomic deletions, we developed a flexible deletion engineering strategy, MACHETE (molecular alteration of chromosomes with engineered tandem elements). Applying MACHETE to a syngeneic mouse model of pancreatic cancer, we found that co-deletion of the IFN cluster promoted immune evasion, metastasis and immunotherapy resistance. Mechanistically, IFN co-deletion disrupted type I IFN signaling in the tumor microenvironment, leading to marked changes in infiltrating immune cells and escape from CD8+ T-cell surveillance, effects largely driven by the poorly understood interferon epsilon. These results reveal a chromosomal deletion that disables both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic tumor suppression and provide a framework for interrogating large deletions in cancer and beyond.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00443-5"
"natcancer","Targeting the ALK-CDK9-Tyr19 kinase cascade sensitizes ovarian and breast tumors to PARP inhibition via destabilization of the P-TEFb complex","Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have demonstrated promising clinical activity in multiple cancers. However, resistance to PARP inhibitors remains a substantial clinical challenge. In the present study, we report that anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) directly phosphorylates CDK9 at tyrosine-19 to promote homologous recombination (HR) repair and PARP inhibitor resistance. Phospho-CDK9-Tyr19 increases its kinase activity and nuclear localization to stabilize positive transcriptional elongation factor b and activate polymerase II-dependent transcription of HR-repair genes. Conversely, ALK inhibition increases ubiquitination and degradation of CDK9 by Skp2, an E3 ligase. Notably, combination of US Food and Drug Administration-approved ALK and PARP inhibitors markedly reduce tumor growth and improve survival of mice in PARP inhibitor-/platinum-resistant tumor xenograft models. Using human tumor biospecimens, we further demonstrate that phosphorylated ALK (p-ALK) expression is associated with resistance to PARP inhibitors and positively correlated with p-Tyr19-CDK9 expression. Together, our findings support a biomarker-driven, combinatorial treatment strategy involving ALK and PARP inhibitors to induce synthetic lethality in PARP inhibitor-/platinum-resistant tumors with high p-ALK-p-Tyr19-CDK9 expression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00438-2"

We conducted Talazoparib Beyond BRCA (NCT02401347), an open-label phase II trial, to evaluate talazoparib in patients with pretreated advanced HER2-negative breast cancer (n = 13) or other solid tumors (n = 7) with mutations in homologous recombination (HR) pathway genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2. In patients with breast cancer, four patients had a Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) partial response (overall response rate, 31%), and three additional patients had stable disease of >=6 months (clinical benefit rate, 54%). All patients with germline mutations in PALB2 (gPALB2; encoding partner and localizer of BRCA2) had treatment-associated tumor regression. Tumor or plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) HR deficiency (HRD) scores were correlated with treatment outcomes and were increased in all gPALB2 tumors. In addition, a gPALB2-associated mutational signature was associated with tumor response. Thus, talazoparib has been demonstrated to have efficacy in patients with advanced breast cancer who have gPALB2 mutations, showing activity in the context of HR pathway gene mutations beyond gBRCA1/2.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00439-1"

"natcancer","Ectopic JAK-STAT activation enables the transition to a stem-like and multilineage state conferring AR-targeted therapy resistance","Emerging evidence indicates that various cancers can gain resistance to targeted therapies by acquiring lineage plasticity. Although various genomic and transcriptomic aberrations correlate with lineage plasticity, the molecular mechanisms enabling the acquisition of lineage plasticity have not been fully elucidated. We reveal that Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling is a crucial executor in promoting lineage plasticity-driven androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy resistance in prostate cancer. Importantly, ectopic JAK-STAT activation is specifically required for the resistance of stem-like subclones expressing multilineage transcriptional programs but not subclones exclusively expressing the neuroendocrine-like lineage program. Both genetic and pharmaceutical inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling resensitizes resistant tumors to AR-targeted therapy. Together, these results suggest that JAK-STAT are compelling therapeutic targets for overcoming lineage plasticity-driven AR-targeted therapy resistance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00431-9"

Here we show the predictive capacity of integrating medical imaging, histopathologic and genomic features to predict immunotherapy response using a cohort of 247 patients with advanced NSCLC with multimodal baseline data obtained during diagnostic clinical workup, including computed tomography scan images, digitized programmed death ligand-1 immunohistochemistry slides and known outcomes to immunotherapy. Using domain expert annotations, we developed a computational workflow to extract patient-level features and used a machine-learning approach to integrate multimodal features into a risk prediction model. Our multimodal model (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74-0.86) outperformed unimodal measures, including tumor mutational burden (AUC = 0.61, 95% CI 0.52-0.70) and programmed death ligand-1 immunohistochemistry score (AUC = 0.73, 95% CI 0.65-0.81). Our study therefore provides a quantitative rationale for using multimodal features to improve prediction of immunotherapy response in patients with NSCLC using expert-guided machine learning.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00416-8"

Subtypes based upon predominant transcription factor expression have been defined that, in mouse models and cell lines, exhibit potential differential therapeutic vulnerabilities, with epigenetically distinct SCLC subtypes also described. The clinical relevance of these subtypes is unclear, due in part to challenges in obtaining tumor biopsies for reliable profiling. Here we describe a robust workflow for genome-wide DNA methylation profiling applied to both patient-derived models and to patients' circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Tumor-specific methylation patterns were readily detected in cfDNA samples from patients with SCLC and were correlated with survival outcomes. cfDNA methylation also discriminated between the transcription factor SCLC subtypes, a precedent for a liquid biopsy cfDNA-methylation approach to molecularly subtype SCLC. Our data reveal the potential clinical utility of cfDNA methylation profiling as a universally applicable liquid biopsy approach for the sensitive detection, monitoring and molecular subtyping of patients with SCLC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00415-9"

"natcancer","Multimodal data integration using machine learning improves risk stratification of high-grade serous ovarian cancer","Patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer suffer poor prognosis and variable response to treatment. Known prognostic factors for this disease include homologous recombination deficiency status, age, pathological stage and residual disease status after debulking surgery. Recent work has highlighted important prognostic information captured in computed tomography and histopathological specimens, which can be exploited through machine learning. However, little is known about the capacity of combining features from these disparate sources to improve prediction of treatment response. Here, we assembled a multimodal dataset of 444 patients with primarily late-stage high-grade serous ovarian cancer and discovered quantitative features, such as tumor nuclear size on staining with hematoxylin and eosin and omental texture on contrast-enhanced computed tomography, associated with prognosis. We found that these features contributed complementary prognostic information relative to one another and clinicogenomic features. By fusing histopathological, radiologic and clinicogenomic machine-learning models, we demonstrate a promising path toward improved risk stratification of patients with cancer through multimodal data integration.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00388-9"
"natcancer","Cytokine release syndrome-like serum responses after COVID-19 vaccination are frequent and clinically inapparent under cancer immunotherapy","Patients with cancer frequently receive immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which may modulate immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines. Recently, cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was observed in a patient with cancer who received BTN162b2 vaccination under ICI treatment. Here, we analyzed adverse events and serum cytokines in patients with 23 different tumors undergoing (n = 64) or not undergoing (n = 26) COVID-19 vaccination under ICI therapy in a prospectively planned German single-center cohort study (n = 220). We did not observe clinically relevant CRS (>=grade 2) after vaccination (95% CI 0-5.6%; Common Terminology of Adverse Events v.5.0) in this small cohort. Within 4 weeks after vaccination, serious adverse events occurred in eight patients (12.5% 95% CI 5.6-23%): six patients were hospitalized due to events common under cancer therapy including immune related adverse events and two patients died due to conditions present before vaccination. Despite absence of CRS symptoms, a set of pairwise-correlated CRS-associated cytokines, including CXCL8 and interleukin-6 was >1.5-fold upregulated in 40% (95% CI 23.9-57.9%) of patients after vaccination.

"natcancer","Limited nutrient availability in the tumor microenvironment renders pancreatic tumors sensitive to allosteric IDH1 inhibitors","Nutrient-deprived conditions in the tumor microenvironment (TME) restrain cancer cell viability due to increased free radicals and reduced energy production. In pancreatic cancer cells a cytosolic metabolic enzyme, wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (wtIDH1), enables adaptation to these conditions. Under nutrient starvation, wtIDH1 oxidizes isocitrate to generate [alpha]-ketoglutarate ([alpha]KG) for anaplerosis and NADPH to support antioxidant defense. In this study, we show that allosteric inhibitors of mutant IDH1 (mIDH1) are potent wtIDH1 inhibitors under conditions present in the TME. We demonstrate that low magnesium levels facilitate allosteric inhibition of wtIDH1, which is lethal to cancer cells when nutrients are limited. Furthermore, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA)-approved mIDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib (AG-120) dramatically inhibited tumor growth in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer, highlighting this approach as a potential therapeutic strategy against wild-type IDH1 cancers.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00393-y"

Here, we map the single-cell chromatin landscape of immune cells from blood, normal tumor-adjacent kidney tissue and malignant tissue from patients with early-stage clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). We catalog the T cell states dictated by tissue-specific and developmental-stage-specific chromatin accessibility patterns, infer key chromatin regulators and observe rewiring of regulatory networks in the progression to dysfunction in CD8+ T cells. Unexpectedly, among the transcription factors orchestrating the path to dysfunction, NF-[kappa]B is associated with a pro-apoptotic program in late stages of dysfunction in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Importantly, this epigenomic profiling stratified ccRCC patients based on a NF-[kappa]B-driven pro-apoptotic signature.

"natcancer","Targeting LIPA independent of its lipase activity is a therapeutic strategy in solid tumors via induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a poor clinical outcome, due to a lack of actionable therapeutic targets. Herein we define lysosomal acid lipase A (LIPA) as a viable molecular target in TNBC and identify a stereospecific small molecule (ERX-41) that binds LIPA. ERX-41 induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress resulting in cell death, and this effect is on target as evidenced by specific LIPA mutations providing resistance. Importantly, we demonstrate that ERX-41 activity is independent of LIPA lipase function but dependent on its ER localization. Mechanistically, ERX-41 binding of LIPA decreases expression of multiple ER-resident proteins involved in protein folding. This targeted vulnerability has a large therapeutic window, with no adverse effects either on normal mammary epithelial cells or in mice. Our study implicates a targeted strategy for solid tumors, including breast, brain, pancreatic and ovarian, whereby small, orally bioavailable molecules targeting LIPA block protein folding, induce ER stress and result in tumor cell death.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00389-8"

Conversely, human tissue-resident [gamma][delta] cells are less well defined. In the present study, we show that human lung tissues harbor a resident V[delta]1 [gamma][delta] T cell population. Moreover, we demonstrate that V[delta]1 T cells with resident memory and effector memory phenotypes were enriched in lung tumors compared with nontumor lung tissues. Intratumoral V[delta]1 T cells possessed stem-like features and were skewed toward cytolysis and helper T cell type 1 function, akin to intratumoral natural killer and CD8+ T cells considered beneficial to the patient. Indeed, ongoing remission post-surgery was significantly associated with the numbers of CD45RA−CD27− effector memory V[delta]1 T cells in tumors and, most strikingly, with the numbers of CD103+ tissue-resident V[delta]1 T cells in nonmalignant lung tissues. Our findings offer basic insights into human body surface immunology that collectively support integrating V[delta]1 T cell biology into immunotherapeutic strategies for nonsmall cell lung cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00376-z"
"natcancer","Acute lymphoblastic leukemia displays a distinct highly methylated genome","DNA methylation is tightly regulated during development and is stably maintained in healthy cells. In contrast, cancer cells are commonly characterized by a global loss of DNA methylation co-occurring with CpG island hypermethylation. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the commonest childhood cancer, perturbations of CpG methylation have been reported to be associated with genetic disease subtype and outcome, but data from large cohorts at a genome-wide scale are lacking. Here, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing across ALL subtypes, leukemia cell lines and healthy hematopoietic cells, and show that unlike most cancers, ALL samples exhibit CpG island hypermethylation but minimal global loss of methylation. This was most pronounced in T cell ALL and accompanied by an exceptionally broad range of hypermethylation of CpG islands between patients, which is influenced by TET2 and DNMT3B. These findings demonstrate that ALL is characterized by an unusually highly methylated genome and provide further insights into the non-canonical regulation of methylation in cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00370-5"
"natcancer","MYCN mediates cysteine addiction and sensitizes neuroblastoma to ferroptosis","Aberrant expression of MYC transcription factor family members predicts poor clinical outcome in many human cancers. Oncogenic MYC profoundly alters metabolism and mediates an antioxidant response to maintain redox balance. Here we show that MYCN induces massive lipid peroxidation on depletion of cysteine, the rate-limiting amino acid for glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis, and sensitizes cells to ferroptosis, an oxidative, non-apoptotic and iron-dependent type of cell death. The high cysteine demand of MYCN-amplified childhood neuroblastoma is met by uptake and transsulfuration. When uptake is limited, cysteine usage for protein synthesis is maintained at the expense of GSH triggering ferroptosis and potentially contributing to spontaneous tumor regression in low-risk neuroblastomas. Pharmacological inhibition of both cystine uptake and transsulfuration combined with GPX4 inactivation resulted in tumor remission in an orthotopic MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma model. These findings provide a proof of concept of combining multiple ferroptosis targets as a promising therapeutic strategy for aggressive MYCN-amplified tumors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00355-4"

However, our understanding of the cellular crosstalk invoked at perivascular sites is still rudimentary. Here, we identify intercellular machinery governing formation of a pro-metastatic vascular niche during breast cancer colonization in the lung. We show that specific secreted factors, induced in metastasis-associated endothelial cells (ECs), promote metastasis in mice by enhancing stem cell properties and the viability of cancer cells. Perivascular macrophages, activated via tenascin C (TNC) stimulation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), were shown to be crucial in niche activation by secreting nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to induce EC-mediated production of niche components. Notably, this mechanism was independent of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a key regulator of EC behavior and angiogenesis. However, targeting both macrophage-mediated vascular niche activation and VEGF-regulated angiogenesis resulted in added potency to curb lung metastasis in mice. Together, our findings provide mechanistic insights into the formation of vascular niches in metastasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-022-00353-6"

In human clinical trials, however, GITR agonist antibodies have shown limited therapeutic effect, which may be due to suboptimal receptor clustering-mediated signaling. To overcome this potential limitation, a rational protein engineering approach is needed to optimize GITR agonist-based immunotherapies. Here we show a bispecific molecule consisting of an anti-PD-1 antibody fused with a multimeric GITR ligand (GITR-L) that induces PD-1-dependent and Fc[gamma]R-independent GITR clustering, resulting in enhanced activation, proliferation and memory differentiation of primed antigen-specific GITR+PD-1+ T cells. The anti-PD-1-GITR-L bispecific is a PD-1-directed GITR-L construct that demonstrated dose-dependent, immunologically driven tumor growth inhibition in syngeneic, genetically engineered and xenograft humanized mouse tumor models, with a dose-dependent correlation between target saturation and Ki67 and TIGIT upregulation on memory T cells.

In the present study, we demonstrate a role for MTHFD2 in DNA replication and genomic stability in cancer cells, and perform a drug screen to identify potent and selective nanomolar MTHFD2 inhibitors; protein cocrystal structures demonstrated binding to the active site of MTHFD2 and target engagement. MTHFD2 inhibitors reduced replication fork speed and induced replication stress followed by S-phase arrest and apoptosis of acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo, with a therapeutic window spanning four orders of magnitude compared with nontumorigenic cells. Mechanistically, MTHFD2 inhibitors prevented thymidine production leading to misincorporation of uracil into DNA and replication stress.

"natcancer","Temporal single-cell tracing reveals clonal revival and expansion of precursor exhausted T cells during anti-PD-1 therapy in lung cancer","Anti-PD-1 treatment has shown unprecedented clinical success in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we performed temporal single-cell RNA and paired T-cell receptor sequencing on 47 tumor biopsies from 36 patients with NSCLC following PD-1-based therapies. We observed increased levels of precursor exhausted T (Texp) cells in responsive tumors after treatment, characterized by low expression of coinhibitory molecules and high expression of GZMK. By contrast, nonresponsive tumors failed to accumulate Texp cells. Our data suggested that Texp cells were unlikely to be derived from the reinvigoration of terminally exhausted cells; instead, they were accumulated by (1) local expansion and (2) replenishment by peripheral T cells with both new and pre-existing clonotypes, a phenomenon we named clonal revival. Our study provides insights into mechanisms underlying PD-1-based therapies, implicating clonal revival and expansion of Texp cells as steps to improve NSCLC treatment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-021-00292-8"
"natcancer","Functional antibody and T cell immunity following SARS-CoV-2 infection, including by variants of concern, in patients with cancer: the CAPTURE study","Patients with cancer have higher COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Here we present the prospective CAPTURE study, integrating longitudinal immune profiling with clinical annotation. Of 357 patients with cancer, 118 were SARS-CoV-2 positive, 94 were symptomatic and 2 died of COVID-19. In this cohort, 83% patients had S1-reactive antibodies and 82% had neutralizing antibodies against wild type SARS-CoV-2, whereas neutralizing antibody titers against the Alpha, Beta and Delta variants were substantially reduced. S1-reactive antibody levels decreased in 13% of patients, whereas neutralizing antibody titers remained stable for up to 329 days. Patients also had detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells and CD4+ responses correlating with S1-reactive antibody levels, although patients with hematological malignancies had impaired immune responses that were disease and treatment specific, but presented compensatory cellular responses, further supported by clinical recovery in all but one patient. Overall, these findings advance the understanding of the nature and duration of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in patients with cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-021-00275-9"
"natcancer","Adaptive immunity and neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern following vaccination in patients with cancer: the CAPTURE study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) antiviral response in a pan-tumor immune monitoring (CAPTURE) (NCT03226886) is a prospective cohort study of COVID-19 immunity in patients with cancer. Here we evaluated 585 patients following administration of two doses of BNT162b2 or AZD1222 vaccines, administered 12 weeks apart. Seroconversion rates after two doses were 85% and 59% in patients with solid and hematological malignancies, respectively. A lower proportion of patients had detectable titers of neutralizing antibodies (NAbT) against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOC) versus wild-type (WT) SARS-CoV-2. Patients with hematological malignancies were more likely to have undetectable NAbT and had lower median NAbT than those with solid cancers against both SARS-CoV-2 WT and VOC. By comparison with individuals without cancer, patients with hematological, but not solid, malignancies had reduced neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses. Seroconversion showed poor concordance with NAbT against VOC. Previous SARS-CoV-2 infection boosted the NAb response including against VOC, and anti-CD20 treatment was associated with undetectable NAbT. Vaccine-induced T cell responses were detected in 80% of patients and were comparable between vaccines or cancer types. Our results have implications for the management of patients with cancer during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-021-00274-w"
"natcancer","Integrating molecular profiles into clinical frameworks through the Molecular Oncology Almanac to prospectively guide precision oncology","Tumor molecular profiling of single gene-variant ('first-order') genomic alterations informs potential therapeutic approaches. Interactions between such first-order events and global molecular features (for example, mutational signatures) are increasingly associated with clinical outcomes, but these 'second-order' alterations are not yet accounted for in clinical interpretation algorithms and knowledge bases. We introduce the Molecular Oncology Almanac (MOAlmanac), a paired clinical interpretation algorithm and knowledge base to enable integrative interpretation of multimodal genomic data for point-of-care decision making and translational-hypothesis generation. We benchmarked MOAlmanac to a first-order interpretation method across multiple retrospective cohorts and observed an increased number of clinical hypotheses from evaluation of molecular features and profile-to-cell line matchmaking. When applied to a prospective precision oncology trial cohort, MOAlmanac nominated a median of two therapies per patient and identified therapeutic strategies administered in 47% of patients. Overall, we present an open-source computational method for integrative clinical interpretation of individualized molecular profiles.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-021-00243-3"
"natcancer","Tryptophan metabolism drives dynamic immunosuppressive myeloid states in IDH-mutant gliomas","The dynamics and phenotypes of intratumoral myeloid cells during tumor progression are poorly understood. Here we define myeloid cellular states in gliomas by longitudinal single-cell profiling and demonstrate their strict control by the tumor genotype: in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant tumors, differentiation of infiltrating myeloid cells is blocked, resulting in an immature phenotype. In late-stage gliomas, monocyte-derived macrophages drive tolerogenic alignment of the microenvironment, thus preventing T cell response. We define the IDH-dependent tumor education of infiltrating macrophages to be causally related to a complex re-orchestration of tryptophan metabolism, resulting in activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor. We further show that the altered metabolism of IDH-mutant gliomas maintains this axis in bystander cells and that pharmacological inhibition of tryptophan metabolism can reverse immunosuppression. In conclusion, we provide evidence of a glioma genotype-dependent intratumoral network of resident and recruited myeloid cells and identify tryptophan metabolism as a target for immunotherapy of IDH-mutant tumors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-021-00201-z"
