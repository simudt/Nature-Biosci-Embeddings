"natcardiovascres","Outlining cardiac ion channel protein interactors and their signature in the human electrocardiogram","Protein–protein interactions are essential for normal cellular processes and signaling events. Defining these interaction networks is therefore crucial for understanding complex cellular functions and interpretation of disease-associated gene variants. We need to build a comprehensive picture of the interactions, their affinities and interdependencies in the specific organ to decipher hitherto poorly understood signaling mechanisms through ion channels. Here we report the experimental identification of the ensemble of protein interactors for 13 types of ion channels in murine cardiac tissue. Of these, we validated the functional importance of ten interactors on cardiac electrophysiology through genetic knockouts in zebrafish, gene silencing in mice, super-resolution microscopy and patch clamp experiments. Furthermore, we establish a computational framework to reconstruct human cardiomyocyte ion channel networks from deep proteome mapping of human heart tissue and human heart single-cell gene expression data. Finally, we integrate the ion channel interactome with human population genetics data to identify proteins that influence the electrocardiogram (ECG). We demonstrate that the combined channel network is enriched for proteins influencing the ECG, with 44% of the network proteins significantly associated with an ECG phenotype. Altogether, we define interactomes of 13 major cardiac ion channels, contextualize their relevance to human electrophysiology and validate functional roles of ten interactors, including two regulators of the sodium current (epsin-2 and gelsolin). Overall, our data provide a roadmap for our understanding of the molecular machinery that regulates cardiac electrophysiology.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00294-y"
"natcardiovascres","Calcineurin signaling promotes takotsubo syndrome","Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is an acute heart failure syndrome that mimics the symptoms of acute myocardial infarction and is often preceded by emotional and/or physical stress. There is currently no treatment for TTS. Here we show that injection of 2.5 mg kg−1 of epinephrine (EPI) into mice recapitulates numerous features of human TTS, including increased myocardial damage and mortality in males. Gene set enrichment analysis of myocardial RNA sequencing after EPI injection revealed significant enrichment of calcineurin-dependent pro-inflammatory gene networks, which was more pronounced in male than in female mice, in agreement with observed sex discrepancies in the mouse phenotype. An increase in calcineurin activity was detected in the circulating cells of patients with TTS, suggesting a systemic nature of the syndrome. Preventive and therapeutic treatment of mice injected with EPI using calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus improved heart function and reduced myocardial injury. Our findings suggest that calcineurin inhibition could be a potential therapy for TTS.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00296-w"

"natcardiovascres","The VE-cadherin/AmotL2 mechanosensory pathway suppresses aortic inflammation and the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms","Endothelial cells respond to mechanical forces exerted by blood flow. Endothelial cell–cell junctions and the sites of endothelial adhesion to the matrix sense and transmit mechanical forces to the cellular cytoskeleton. Here we show that the scaffold protein AmotL2 connects junctional VE-cadherin and actin filaments to the nuclear lamina. AmotL2 is essential for the formation of radial actin filaments and the alignment of endothelial cells, and, in its absence, nuclear integrity and positioning are altered. Molecular analysis demonstrated that VE-cadherin binds to AmotL2 and actin, resulting in a cascade that transmits extracellular mechanical signals to the nuclear membrane. Furthermore, the endothelial deficit of AmotL2 in mice fed normal diet provoked a pro-inflammatory response and abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Transcriptome analysis of human AAA samples revealed a negative correlation between AmotL2 and inflammation of the aortic intima. These findings offer insight into the link between junctional mechanotransduction and vascular disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00298-8"
"natcardiovascres","Systems immunology-based drug repurposing framework to target inflammation in atherosclerosis","The development of new immunotherapies to treat the inflammatory mechanisms that sustain atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is urgently needed. Herein, we present a path to drug repurposing to identify immunotherapies for ASCVD. The integration of time-of-flight mass cytometry and RNA sequencing identified unique inflammatory signatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with ASCVD plasma. By comparing these inflammatory signatures to large-scale gene expression data from the LINCS L1000 dataset, we identified drugs that could reverse this inflammatory response. Ex vivo screens, using human samples, showed that saracatinib—a phase 2a-ready SRC and ABL inhibitor—reversed the inflammatory responses induced by ASCVD plasma. In Apoe−/− mice, saracatinib reduced atherosclerosis progression by reprogramming reparative macrophages. In a rabbit model of advanced atherosclerosis, saracatinib reduced plaque inflammation measured by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography–magnetic resonance imaging. Here we show a systems immunology-driven drug repurposing with a preclinical validation strategy to aid the development of cardiovascular immunotherapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00278-y"
"natcardiovascres","Incongruence between transcriptional and vascular pathophysiological cell states","The Notch pathway is a major regulator of endothelial transcriptional specification. Targeting the Notch receptors or Delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) dysregulates angiogenesis. Here, by analyzing single and compound genetic mutants for all Notch signaling members, we find significant differences in the way ligands and receptors regulate liver vascular homeostasis. Loss of Notch receptors caused endothelial hypermitogenic cell-cycle arrest and senescence. Conversely, Dll4 loss triggered a strong Myc-driven transcriptional switch inducing endothelial proliferation and the tip-cell state. Myc loss suppressed the induction of angiogenesis in the absence of Dll4, without preventing the vascular enlargement and organ pathology. Similarly, inhibition of other pro-angiogenic pathways, including MAPK/ERK and mTOR, had no effect on the vascular expansion induced by Dll4 loss; however, anti-VEGFA treatment prevented it without fully suppressing the transcriptional and metabolic programs. This study shows incongruence between single-cell transcriptional states, vascular phenotypes and related pathophysiology. Our findings also suggest that the vascular structure abnormalization, rather than neoplasms, causes the reported anti-Dll4 antibody toxicity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00272-4"

"natcardiovascres","Genetic or therapeutic neutralization of ALK1 reduces LDL transcytosis and atherosclerosis in mice","Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) accumulation in the arterial wall contributes to atherosclerosis initiation and progression1. Activin A receptor-like type 1 (ACVRL1, called activin-like kinase receptor (ALK1)) is a recently identified receptor that mediates LDL entry and transcytosis in endothelial cells (ECs)2,3. However, the role of this pathway in vivo is not yet known. In the present study, we show that genetic deletion of ALK1 in arterial ECs of mice substantially limits LDL accumulation, macrophage infiltration and atherosclerosis without affecting cholesterol or triglyceride levels. Moreover, a selective monoclonal antibody binding ALK1 efficiently blocked LDL transcytosis, but not bone morphogenetic protein-9 (BMP9) signaling, dramatically reducing plaque formation in LDL receptor knockout mice fed a high-fat diet. Thus, our results demonstrate that blocking LDL transcytosis into the endothelium may be a promising therapeutic strategy that targets the initiating event of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00266-2"

"natcardiovascres","Platelet glycoprotein V spatio-temporally controls fibrin formation","The activation of platelets and coagulation at vascular injury sites is crucial for hemostasis but can promote thrombosis and inflammation in vascular pathologies. Here, we delineate an unexpected spatio-temporal control mechanism of thrombin activity that is platelet orchestrated and locally limits excessive fibrin formation after initial hemostatic platelet deposition. During platelet activation, the abundant platelet glycoprotein (GP)V is cleaved by thrombin. We demonstrate, with genetic and pharmacological approaches, that thrombin-mediated shedding of GPV does not primarily regulate platelet activation in thrombus formation but rather has a distinct function after platelet deposition and specifically limits thrombin-dependent generation of fibrin, a crucial mediator of vascular thrombo-inflammation. Genetic or pharmacologic defects in hemostatic platelet function are unexpectedly attenuated by specific blockade of GPV shedding, indicating that the spatio-temporal control of thrombin-dependent fibrin generation also represents a potential therapeutic target to improve hemostasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00254-6"
"natcardiovascres","Three-dimensional morphologic and molecular atlases of nasal vasculature","Understanding the function of the nasal vasculature in homeostasis and pathogenesis of common nasal diseases is important. Here we describe an extensive network of venous sinusoids (VSs) in mouse and human nasal mucosa. The endothelium of the VSs expressed Prox1 (considered to be a constitutive marker of lymphatic endothelium) and high levels of VCAM-1 and exhibited unusual cell-to-cell junctions. VSs are supported by circular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and surrounded by immune cells. The nasal mucosa also showed a rich supply of lymphatic vessels with distinctive features, such as the absence of the lymphatic marker LYVE1 and sharp-ended capillaries. In mouse models of allergic rhinitis or acute Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, Prox1+ VSs were regressed or compromised. However, in aged mice, the VSs lost the SMC support and were expanded and enlarged. Our findings demonstrate three-dimensional morphological and molecular heterogeneities of the nasal vasculature and offer insights into their associations with nasal inflammation, infection and aging.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00257-3"
"natcardiovascres","Live-cell photoactivated localization microscopy correlates nanoscale ryanodine receptor configuration to calcium sparks in cardiomyocytes","Ca2+ sparks constitute the fundamental units of Ca2+ release in cardiomyocytes. Here we investigate how ryanodine receptors (RyRs) collectively generate these events by employing a transgenic mouse with a photoactivated label on RyR2. This allowed correlative imaging of RyR localization, by super-resolution photoactivated localization microscopy, and Ca2+ sparks, by high-speed imaging. Two populations of Ca2+ sparks were observed: stationary events and ‘traveling’ events that spread between neighboring RyR clusters. Traveling sparks exhibited up to eight distinct releases, sourced from local or distal junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum. Quantitative analyses showed that sparks may be triggered by any number of RyRs within a cluster, and that acute β-adrenergic stimulation augments intracluster RyR recruitment to generate larger events. In contrast, RyR ‘dispersion’ during heart failure facilitates the generation of traveling sparks. Thus, RyRs cooperatively generate Ca2+ sparks in a complex, malleable fashion, and channel organization regulates the propensity for local propagation of Ca2+ release.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00199-2"
"natcardiovascres","The angiopoietin receptor Tie2 is atheroprotective in arterial endothelium","Leukocytes and resident cells in the arterial wall contribute to atherosclerosis, especially at sites of disturbed blood flow. Expression of endothelial Tie1 receptor tyrosine kinase is enhanced at these sites, and attenuation of its expression reduces atherosclerotic burden and decreases inflammation. However, Tie2 tyrosine kinase function in atherosclerosis is unknown. Here we provide genetic evidence from humans and from an atherosclerotic mouse model to show that TIE2 is associated with protection from coronary artery disease. We show that deletion of Tie2, or both Tie2 and Tie1, in the arterial endothelium promotes atherosclerosis by increasing Foxo1 nuclear localization, endothelial adhesion molecule expression and accumulation of immune cells. We also show that Tie2 is expressed in a subset of aortic fibroblasts, and its silencing in these cells increases expression of inflammation-related genes. Our findings indicate that unlike Tie1, the Tie2 receptor functions as the dominant endothelial angiopoietin receptor that protects from atherosclerosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00224-y"
"natcardiovascres","Pairing of single-cell RNA analysis and T cell antigen receptor profiling indicates breakdown of T cell tolerance checkpoints in atherosclerosis","Atherosclerotic plaques form in the inner layer of arteries triggering heart attacks and strokes. Although T cells have been detected in atherosclerosis, tolerance dysfunction as a disease driver remains unexplored. Here we examine tolerance checkpoints in atherosclerotic plaques, artery tertiary lymphoid organs and lymph nodes in mice burdened by advanced atherosclerosis, via single-cell RNA sequencing paired with T cell antigen receptor sequencing. Complex patterns of deteriorating peripheral T cell tolerance were observed being most pronounced in plaques followed by artery tertiary lymphoid organs, lymph nodes and blood. Affected checkpoints included clonal expansion of CD4+, CD8+ and regulatory T cells; aberrant tolerance-regulating transcripts of clonally expanded T cells; T cell exhaustion; Treg–TH17 T cell conversion; and dysfunctional antigen presentation. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing profiles of human plaques revealed that the CD8+ T cell tolerance dysfunction observed in mouse plaques was shared in human coronary and carotid artery plaques. Thus, our data support the concept of atherosclerosis as a bona fide T cell autoimmune disease targeting the arterial wall.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00218-w"
"natcardiovascres","Alpha kinase 3 signaling at the M-band maintains sarcomere integrity and proteostasis in striated muscle","Muscle contraction is driven by the molecular machinery of the sarcomere. As phosphorylation is a critical regulator of muscle function, the identification of regulatory kinases is important for understanding sarcomere biology. Pathogenic variants in alpha kinase 3 (ALPK3) cause cardiomyopathy and musculoskeletal disease, but little is known about this atypical kinase. Here we show that ALPK3 is an essential component of the M-band of the sarcomere and define the ALPK3-dependent phosphoproteome. ALPK3 deficiency impaired contractility both in human cardiac organoids and in the hearts of mice harboring a pathogenic truncating Alpk3 variant. ALPK3-dependent phosphopeptides were enriched for sarcomeric components of the M-band and the ubiquitin-binding protein sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1) (also known as p62). Analysis of the ALPK3 interactome confirmed binding to M-band proteins including SQSTM1. In human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes modeling cardiomyopathic ALPK3 mutations, sarcomeric organization and M-band localization of SQSTM1 were abnormal suggesting that this mechanism may underly disease pathogenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00219-9"
"natcardiovascres","KDM8 epigenetically controls cardiac metabolism to prevent initiation of dilated cardiomyopathy","Cardiac metabolism is deranged in heart failure, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that lysine demethylase 8 (Kdm8) maintains an active mitochondrial gene network by repressing Tbx15, thus preventing dilated cardiomyopathy leading to lethal heart failure. Deletion of Kdm8 in mouse cardiomyocytes increased H3K36me2 with activation of Tbx15 and repression of target genes in the NAD+ pathway before dilated cardiomyopathy initiated. NAD+ supplementation prevented dilated cardiomyopathy in Kdm8 mutant mice, and TBX15 overexpression blunted NAD+-activated cardiomyocyte respiration. Furthermore, KDM8 was downregulated in human hearts affected by dilated cardiomyopathy, and higher TBX15 expression defines a subgroup of affected hearts with the strongest downregulation of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. Thus, KDM8 represses TBX15 to maintain cardiac metabolism. Our results suggest that epigenetic dysregulation of metabolic gene networks initiates myocardium deterioration toward heart failure and could underlie heterogeneity of dilated cardiomyopathy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-023-00214-0"
"natcardiovascres","Non-invasive mapping of systemic neutrophil dynamics upon cardiovascular injury","Neutrophils play a complex role during onset of tissue injury and subsequent resolution and healing. To assess neutrophil dynamics upon cardiovascular injury, here we develop a non-invasive, background-free approach for specific mapping of neutrophil dynamics by whole-body magnetic resonance imaging using targeted multimodal fluorine-loaded nanotracers engineered with binding peptides specifically directed against murine or human neutrophils. Intravenous tracer application before injury allowed non-invasive three-dimensional visualization of neutrophils within their different hematopoietic niches over the entire body and subsequent monitoring of their egress into affected tissues. Stimulated murine and human neutrophils exhibited enhanced labeling due to upregulation of their target receptors, which could be exploited as an in vivo readout for their activation state in both sterile and nonsterile cardiovascular inflammation. This non-invasive approach will allow us to identify hidden origins of bacterial or sterile inflammation in patients and also to unravel cardiovascular disease states on the verge of severe aggravation due to enhanced neutrophil infiltration or activation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00210-w"
"natcardiovascres","Single-cell T cell receptor sequencing of paired human atherosclerotic plaques and blood reveals autoimmune-like features of expanded effector T cells","Atherosclerosis is a lipid-driven chronic inflammatory disease; however, whether it can be classified as an autoimmune disease remains unclear. In this study, we applied single-cell T cell receptor seqencing (scTCR-seq) on human carotid artery plaques and matched peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples to assess the extent of TCR clonality and antigen-specific activation within the various T cell subsets. We observed the highest degree of plaque-specific clonal expansion in effector CD4+ T cells, and these clonally expanded T cells expressed genes such as CD69, FOS and FOSB, indicative of recent TCR engagement, suggesting antigen-specific stimulation. CellChat analysis suggested multiple potential interactions of these effector CD4+ T cells with foam cells. Finally, we integrated a published scTCR-seq dataset of the autoimmune disease psoriatic arthritis, and we report various commonalities between the two diseases. In conclusion, our data suggest that atherosclerosis has an autoimmune compondent driven by autoreactive CD4+ T cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00208-4"
"natcardiovascres","Surfaceome mapping of primary human heart cells with CellSurfer uncovers cardiomyocyte surface protein LSMEM2 and proteome dynamics in failing hearts","Cardiac cell surface proteins are drug targets and useful biomarkers for discriminating among cellular phenotypes and disease states. Here we developed an analytical platform, CellSurfer, that enables quantitative cell surface proteome (surfaceome) profiling of cells present in limited quantities, and we apply it to isolated primary human heart cells. We report experimental evidence of surface localization and extracellular domains for 1,144 N-glycoproteins, including cell-type-restricted and region-restricted glycoproteins. We identified a surface protein specific for healthy cardiomyocytes, LSMEM2, and validated an anti-LSMEM2 monoclonal antibody for flow cytometry and imaging. Surfaceome comparisons among pluripotent stem cell derivatives and their primary counterparts highlighted important differences with direct implications for drug screening and disease modeling. Finally, 20% of cell surface proteins, including LSMEM2, were differentially abundant between failing and non-failing cardiomyocytes. These results represent a rich resource to advance development of cell type and organ-specific targets for drug delivery, disease modeling, immunophenotyping and in vivo imaging","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00200-y"
"natcardiovascres","Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-7 (IGFBP7) links senescence to heart failure","Heart failure (HF) is a rising global cardiovascular epidemic driven by aging and chronic inflammation. As elderly populations continue to increase, precision treatments for age-related cardiac decline are urgently needed. Here we report that cardiac and blood expression of IGFBP7 is robustly increased in patients with chronic HF and in an HF mouse model. In a pressure overload mouse HF model, Igfbp7 deficiency attenuated cardiac dysfunction by reducing cardiac inflammatory injury, tissue fibrosis and cellular senescence. IGFBP7 promoted cardiac senescence by stimulating IGF-1R/IRS/AKT-dependent suppression of FOXO3a, preventing DNA repair and reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification, thereby accelerating the progression of HF. In vivo, AAV9-shRNA-mediated cardiac myocyte Igfbp7 knockdown indicated that myocardial IGFBP7 directly regulates pathological cardiac remodeling. Moreover, antibody-mediated IGFBP7 neutralization in vivo reversed IGFBP7-induced suppression of FOXO3a, restored DNA repair and ROS detoxification signals and attenuated pressure-overload-induced HF in mice. Consequently, selectively targeting IGFBP7-regulated senescence pathways may have broad therapeutic potential for HF.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00181-y"
"natcardiovascres","A single-cell comparison of adult and fetal human epicardium defines the age-associated changes in epicardial activity","Re-activating quiescent adult epicardium represents a potential therapeutic approach for human cardiac regeneration. However, the exact molecular differences between inactive adult and active fetal epicardium are not known. In this study, we combined fetal and adult human hearts using single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing and compared epicardial cells from both stages. We found that a migratory fibroblast-like epicardial population only in the fetal heart and fetal epicardium expressed angiogenic gene programs, whereas the adult epicardium was solely mesothelial and immune responsive. Furthermore, we predicted that adult hearts may still receive fetal epicardial paracrine communication, including WNT signaling with endocardium, reinforcing the validity of regenerative strategies that administer or reactivate epicardial cells in situ. Finally, we explained graft efficacy of our human embryonic stem-cell-derived epicardium model by noting its similarity to human fetal epicardium. Overall, our study defines epicardial programs of regenerative angiogenesis absent in adult hearts, contextualizes animal studies and defines epicardial states required for effective human heart regeneration.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00183-w"
"natcardiovascres","Loss of soluble guanylyl cyclase in platelets contributes to atherosclerotic plaque formation and vascular inflammation","Variants in genes encoding the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) in platelets are associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. Here, by using histology, flow cytometry and intravital microscopy, we show that functional loss of sGC in platelets of atherosclerosis-prone Ldlr−/− mice contributes to atherosclerotic plaque formation, particularly via increasing in vivo leukocyte adhesion to atherosclerotic lesions. In vitro experiments revealed that supernatant from activated platelets lacking sGC promotes leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells (ECs) by activating ECs. Profiling of platelet-released cytokines indicated that reduced platelet angiopoietin-1 release by sGC-depleted platelets, which was validated in isolated human platelets from carriers of GUCY1A1 risk alleles, enhances leukocyte adhesion to ECs. Importantly, pharmacological sGC stimulation increased platelet angiopoietin-1 release in vitro and reduced leukocyte recruitment and atherosclerotic plaque formation in atherosclerosis-prone Ldlr−/− mice. Therefore, pharmacological sGC stimulation might represent a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent and treat CAD.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00175-w"
"natcardiovascres","Tyrosine-protein kinase Yes controls endothelial junctional plasticity and barrier integrity by regulating VE-cadherin phosphorylation and endocytosis","Vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin in endothelial adherens junctions is an essential component of the vascular barrier, critical for tissue homeostasis and implicated in diseases such as cancer and retinopathies. Inhibitors of Src cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase have been applied to suppress VE-cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation and prevent excessive leakage, edema and high interstitial pressure. Here we show that the Src-related Yes tyrosine kinase, rather than Src, is localized at endothelial cell (EC) junctions where it becomes activated in a flow-dependent manner. EC-specific Yes1 deletion suppresses VE-cadherin phosphorylation and arrests VE-cadherin at EC junctions. This is accompanied by loss of EC collective migration and exaggerated agonist-induced macromolecular leakage. Overexpression of Yes1 causes ectopic VE-cadherin phosphorylation, while vascular leakage is unaffected. In contrast, in EC-specific Src deficiency, VE-cadherin internalization is maintained and leakage is suppressed. In conclusion, Yes-mediated phosphorylation regulates constitutive VE-cadherin turnover, thereby maintaining endothelial junction plasticity and vascular integrity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00172-z"
"natcardiovascres","Spatiotemporal transcriptome analysis reveals critical roles for mechano-sensing genes at the border zone in remodeling after myocardial infarction","The underlying mechanisms of ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) remain largely unknown. In this study, we performed an integrative analysis of spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) in a murine MI model and found that mechanical stress-response genes are expressed at the border zone and play a critical role in left ventricular remodeling after MI. An integrative analysis of snRNA-seq and spatial transcriptome of the heart tissue after MI identified the unique cluster that appeared at the border zone in an early stage, highly expressing mechano-sensing genes, such as Csrp3. AAV9-mediated gene silencing and overexpression of Csrp3 demonstrated that upregulation of Csrp3 plays critical roles in preventing cardiac remodeling after MI by regulation of genes associated with mechano-sensing. Overall, our study not only provides an insight into spatiotemporal molecular changes after MI but also highlights that the mechano-sensing genes at the border zone act as adaptive regulators of left ventricular remodeling.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00140-7"
"natcardiovascres","Rad regulation of CaV1.2 channels controls cardiac fight-or-flight response","Fight-or-flight responses involve β-adrenergic-induced increases in heart rate and contractile force. In the present study, we uncover the primary mechanism underlying the heart’s innate contractile reserve. We show that four protein kinase A (PKA)-phosphorylated residues in Rad, a calcium channel inhibitor, are crucial for controlling basal calcium current and essential for β-adrenergic augmentation of calcium influx in cardiomyocytes. Even with intact PKA signaling to other proteins modulating calcium handling, preventing adrenergic activation of calcium channels in Rad-phosphosite-mutant mice (4SA-Rad) has profound physiological effects: reduced heart rate with increased pauses, reduced basal contractility, near-complete attenuation of β-adrenergic contractile response and diminished exercise capacity. Conversely, expression of mutant calcium-channel β-subunits that cannot bind 4SA-Rad is sufficient to enhance basal calcium influx and contractility to adrenergically augmented levels of wild-type mice, rescuing the failing heart phenotype of 4SA-Rad mice. Hence, disruption of interactions between Rad and calcium channels constitutes the foundation toward next-generation therapeutics specifically enhancing cardiac contractility.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00157-y"
"natcardiovascres","GPR55 in B cells limits atherosclerosis development and regulates plasma cell maturation","Dissecting the pathways regulating the adaptive immune response in atherosclerosis is of particular therapeutic interest. Here we report that the lipid G-protein-coupled receptor GPR55 is highly expressed by splenic plasma cells (PCs), upregulated in mouse spleens during atherogenesis and human unstable or ruptured compared to stable plaques. Gpr55-deficient mice developed larger atherosclerotic plaques with increased necrotic core size compared to their corresponding controls. Lack of GPR55 hyperactivated B cells, disturbed PC maturation and resulted in IgG overproduction. B-cell-specific Gpr55 depletion or adoptive transfer of Gpr55-deficient B cells was sufficient to promote plaque development and elevated IgG titers. In vitro, the endogenous GPR55 ligand lysophsophatidylinositol (LPI) enhanced PC proliferation, whereas GPR55 antagonism blocked PC maturation and increased their mitochondrial content. Collectively, these discoveries provide previously undefined evidence for GPR55 in B cells as a key modulator of the adaptive immune response in atherosclerosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00155-0"

In this study, we generated and characterized a mouse model of ATS1 carrying the trafficking-deficient mutant Kir2.1Δ314-315 channel. The mutant mouse recapitulates the electrophysiological phenotype of ATS1, with QT prolongation exacerbated by flecainide or isoproterenol, drug-induced QRS prolongation, increased vulnerability to reentrant arrhythmias and multifocal discharges resembling catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Kir2.1Δ314-315 cardiomyocytes display significantly reduced inward rectifier K+ and Na+ currents, depolarized resting membrane potential and prolonged action potentials. We show that, in wild-type mouse cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle cells, Kir2.1 channels localize to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) microdomains, contributing to intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Kir2.1Δ314-315 cardiomyocytes exhibit defective SR Kir2.1 localization and function, as intact and permeabilized Kir2.1Δ314-315 cardiomyocytes display abnormal spontaneous Ca2+ release events. Overall, defective Kir2.1 channel function at the sarcolemma and the SR explain the life-threatening arrhythmias in ATS1 and its overlap with CPVT.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00145-2"
"natcardiovascres","Estrogen enforces the integrity of blood vessels in the bone during pregnancy and menopause","The mammalian skeletal system shows sex differences in structure, functions, aging and disease incidences. The role of blood vessels in physiological, regenerative and pathological bone functions indicates the requisite to understanding their sex specificity. In this study, we found that estrogen regulates blood vessel physiology during pregnancy and menopause through estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and G-protein-coupled estrogen receptor-1 (GPER1) but not ERβ-dependent signaling in mice. Estrogen regulates the lipid use of bone endothelial cells (BECs) and promotes lipolysis of adipocytes and fatty acid (FA) uptake from the microenvironment. Low estrogen conditions skew endothelial FA metabolism to accumulate lipid peroxides (LPOs), leading to vascular aging. High ferrous ion levels in female BECs intensify LPO accumulation and accelerate the aging process. Notably, inhibiting LPO generation using liproxstatin-1 in aged mice significantly improved bone heath. Thus, our findings demonstrate the effects of estrogen on BECs and suggest that LPO targeting could be an efficient strategy to manage blood and bone health in females.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00139-0"
"natcardiovascres","Spatiotemporal transcriptomics reveals pathogenesis of viral myocarditis","A significant fraction of sudden death in children and young adults is due to viral myocarditis, an inflammatory disease of the heart. In this study, by using integrated single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we created a high-resolution, spatially resolved transcriptome map of reovirus-induced myocarditis in neonatal mouse hearts. We assayed hearts collected at three timepoints after infection and studied the temporal, spatial and cellular heterogeneity of host–virus interactions. We further assayed the intestine, the primary site of reovirus infection, to establish a full chronology of molecular events that ultimately lead to myocarditis. We found that inflamed endothelial cells recruit cytotoxic T cells and undergo pyroptosis in the myocarditic tissue. Analyses of spatially restricted gene expression in myocarditic regions and the border zone identified immune-mediated cell-type-specific injury and stress responses. Overall, we observed a complex network of cellular phenotypes and spatially restricted cell–cell interactions associated with reovirus-induced myocarditis in neonatal mice.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00138-1"
"natcardiovascres","Fat infiltration in the infarcted heart as a paradigm for ventricular arrhythmias","Infiltrating adipose tissue (inFAT) has been recently found to co-localize with scar in infarcted hearts and may contribute to ventricular arrhythmias (VAs), a life-threatening heart rhythm disorder. However, the contribution of inFAT to VA has not been well-established. We investigated the role of inFAT versus scar in VA through a combined prospective clinical and mechanistic computational study. Using personalized computational heart models and comparing the results from simulations of VA dynamics with measured electrophysiological abnormalities during the clinical procedure, we demonstrate that inFAT, rather than scar, is a primary driver of arrhythmogenic propensity and is frequently present in critical regions of the VA circuit. We determined that, within the VA circuitry, inFAT, as opposed to scar, is primarily responsible for conduction slowing in critical sites, mechanistically promoting VA.

"natcardiovascres","Age-dependent sex differences in cardiometabolic risk factors","Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) are a major cause of mortality worldwide, yet men and women present remarkable differences in disease prognosis, onset and manifestation. Here we characterize how sex differences in cardiometabolic risk factors vary with age by examining 45 phenotypes and 6 lifestyle factors in 146,021 participants of the Dutch population cohort Lifelines. We show that sex differences are present in 71% of the studied phenotypes. For 31% of these phenotypes, the phenotypic difference between sexes is dependent on age. CMD risk factors show various patterns of age-related sex differences, ranging from no difference for phenotypes such as body mass index (BMI) to strong age-modified sex differences for lipid levels. We also identify lifestyle factors that influence phenotypes in a sex- and age-dependent manner. These results highlight the importance of taking age into account when studying sex differences in CMDs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00131-8"
"natcardiovascres","Neutrophils incite and macrophages avert electrical storm after myocardial infarction","Sudden cardiac death, arising from abnormal electrical conduction, occurs frequently in patients with coronary heart disease. Myocardial ischemia simultaneously induces arrhythmia and massive myocardial leukocyte changes. In this study, we optimized a mouse model in which hypokalemia combined with myocardial infarction triggered spontaneous ventricular tachycardia in ambulatory mice, and we showed that major leukocyte subsets have opposing effects on cardiac conduction. Neutrophils increased ventricular tachycardia via lipocalin-2 in mice, whereas neutrophilia associated with ventricular tachycardia in patients. In contrast, macrophages protected against arrhythmia. Depleting recruited macrophages in Ccr2−/− mice or all macrophage subsets with Csf1 receptor inhibition increased both ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. Higher arrhythmia burden and mortality in Cd36−/− and Mertk−/− mice, viewed together with reduced mitochondrial integrity and accelerated cardiomyocyte death in the absence of macrophages, indicated that receptor-mediated phagocytosis protects against lethal electrical storm. Thus, modulation of leukocyte function provides a potential therapeutic pathway for reducing the risk of sudden cardiac death.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00094-w"
"natcardiovascres","The Complementary Value of Absolute Coronary Flow in the Assessment of Patients with Ischaemic Heart Disease","Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the current gold standard invasive assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD). FFR reports coronary blood flow (CBF) as a fraction of a hypothetical and unknown normal value. Although used routinely to diagnose CAD and guide treatment, how accurately FFR predicts actual CBF changes remains unknown. In this study, we compared fractional CBF with absolute CBF (aCBF, in ml min−1), measured with a computational method during standard angiography and pressure wire assessment, on 203 diseased arteries (143 patients). We found a substantial correlation between the two measurements (r = 0.89 and Cohen’s kappa = 0.71). Concordance between fractional and absolute CBF reduction was high when FFR was >0.80 (91%) but reduced when FFR was ≤0.80 (81%), 0.70–0.80 (68%) and, particularly, 0.75–0.80 (62%). Discordance was associated with coronary microvascular resistance, vessel diameter and mass of myocardium subtended, all factors to which FFR is agnostic. Assessment of aCBF complements FFR and may be valuable to assess CBF, particularly in cases within the FFR ‘gray zone’.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00091-z"
"natcardiovascres","Piezo1 is the cardiac mechanosensor that initiates the cardiomyocyte hypertrophic response to pressure overload in adult mice","Pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy is a maladaptive response with poor outcomes and limited treatment options. The transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) ion channel is key to activation of a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII)-reliant hypertrophic signaling pathway after pressure overload, but TRPM4 is neither stretch-activated nor Ca2+-permeable. Here we show that Piezo1, which is both stretch-activated and Ca2+-permeable, is the mechanosensor that transduces increased myocardial forces into the chemical signal that initiates hypertrophic signaling via a close physical interaction with TRPM4. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Piezo1 in adult mice prevented activation of CaMKII and inhibited the hypertrophic response: residual hypertrophy was associated with calcineurin activation in the absence of its usual inhibition by activated CaMKII. Piezo1 deletion prevented upregulation of the sodium–calcium exchanger and changes in other Ca2+ handling proteins after pressure overload. These findings establish Piezo1 as the cardiomyocyte mechanosensor that instigates the maladaptive hypertrophic response to pressure overload, and as a potential therapeutic target.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00082-0"
"natcardiovascres","Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived treatment of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension","Here we report application of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (HUCMSC)-derived therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). A 3-year-old female presented with heritable PAH associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and was treated for 6 months with serial intravascular infusions of conditioned media (CM) from allogenic HUCMSCs. The treatment markedly improved clinical and hemodynamic parameters and decreased blood plasma markers of vascular fibrosis, injury and inflammation. A comparative analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data collected from three HUCMSCs and two human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) controls identified eight common cell clusters, all of which indicated regenerative potential specific for HUCMSCs. The properties of HUCMSCs were validated by untargeted label-free quantitation of the cell and CM proteome, suggesting increased activity of regeneration, autophagy and anti-inflammation pathways and mitochondrial function. Prostaglandin analysis demonstrated increased HUCMSC secretion of prostaglandin E2, known for its regenerative capacity. Additional prospective clinical studies are warranted to confirm and further explore the benefits of HUCMSC-derived therapy for PAH.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00083-z"
"natcardiovascres","Pseudodynamic analysis of heart tube formation in the mouse reveals strong regional variability and early left–right asymmetry","Understanding organ morphogenesis requires a precise geometrical description of the tissues involved in the process. The high morphological variability in mammalian embryos hinders the quantitative analysis of organogenesis. In particular, the study of early heart development in mammals remains a challenging problem due to imaging limitations and complexity. Here, we provide a complete morphological description of mammalian heart tube formation based on detailed imaging of a temporally dense collection of mouse embryonic hearts. We develop strategies for morphometric staging and quantification of local morphological variations between specimens. We identify hot spots of regionalized variability and identify Nodal-controlled left–right asymmetry of the inflow tracts as the earliest signs of organ left–right asymmetry in the mammalian embryo. Finally, we generate a three-dimensional+t digital model that allows co-representation of data from different sources and provides a framework for the computer modeling of heart tube formation","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00065-1"

"natcardiovascres","Genetic and environmental determinants of diastolic heart function","Diastole is the sequence of physiological events that occur in the heart during ventricular filling and principally depends on myocardial relaxation and chamber stiffness. Abnormal diastolic function is related to many cardiovascular disease processes and is predictive of health outcomes, but its genetic architecture is largely unknown. Here, we use machine-learning cardiac motion analysis to measure diastolic functional traits in 39,559 participants of the UK Biobank and perform a genome-wide association study. We identified nine significant, independent loci near genes that are associated with maintaining sarcomeric function under biomechanical stress and genes implicated in the development of cardiomyopathy. Age, sex and diabetes were independent predictors of diastolic function and we found a causal relationship between genetically determined ventricular stiffness and incident heart failure. Our results provide insights into the genetic and environmental factors influencing diastolic function that are relevant for identifying causal relationships and potential tractable targets.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00048-2"
"natcardiovascres","Arrhythmic sudden death survival prediction using deep learning analysis of scarring in the heart","Sudden cardiac death from arrhythmia is a major cause of mortality worldwide. In this study, we developed a novel deep learning (DL) approach that blends neural networks and survival analysis to predict patient-specific survival curves from contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance images and clinical covariates for patients with ischemic heart disease. The DL-predicted survival curves offer accurate predictions at times up to 10 years and allow for estimation of uncertainty in predictions. The performance of this learning architecture was evaluated on multi-center internal validation data and tested on an independent test set, achieving concordance indexes of 0.83 and 0.74 and 10-year integrated Brier scores of 0.12 and 0.14. We demonstrate that our DL approach, with only raw cardiac images as input, outperforms standard survival models constructed using clinical covariates. This technology has the potential to transform clinical decision-making by offering accurate and generalizable predictions of patient-specific survival probabilities of arrhythmic death over time.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00041-9"
"natcardiovascres","Single-cell transcriptomics reveals cell-type-specific diversification in human heart failure","Heart failure represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Single-cell transcriptomics have revolutionized our understanding of cell composition and associated gene expression. Through integrated analysis of single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data generated from 27 healthy donors and 18 individuals with dilated cardiomyopathy, here we define the cell composition of the healthy and failing human heart. We identify cell-specific transcriptional signatures associated with age and heart failure and reveal the emergence of disease-associated cell states. Notably, cardiomyocytes converge toward common disease-associated cell states, whereas fibroblasts and myeloid cells undergo dramatic diversification. Endothelial cells and pericytes display global transcriptional shifts without changes in cell complexity. Collectively, our findings provide a comprehensive analysis of the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of human heart failure, identify cell type-specific transcriptional programs and disease-associated cell states and establish a valuable resource for the investigation of human heart failure.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00028-6"
"natcardiovascres","Extensive identification of genes involved in congenital and structural heart disorders and cardiomyopathy","Clinical presentation of congenital heart disease is heterogeneous, making identification of the disease-causing genes and their genetic pathways and mechanisms of action challenging. By using in vivo electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiography and microcomputed tomography imaging to screen 3,894 single-gene-null mouse lines for structural and functional cardiac abnormalities, here we identify 705 lines with cardiac arrhythmia, myocardial hypertrophy and/or ventricular dilation. Among these 705 genes, 486 have not been previously associated with cardiac dysfunction in humans, and some of them represent variants of unknown relevance (VUR). Mice with mutations in Casz1, Dnajc18, Pde4dip, Rnf38 or Tmem161b genes show developmental cardiac structural abnormalities, with their human orthologs being categorized as VUR. Using UK Biobank data, we validate the importance of the DNAJC18 gene for cardiac homeostasis by showing that its loss of function is associated with altered left ventricular systolic function. Our results identify hundreds of previously unappreciated genes with potential function in congenital heart disease and suggest causal function of five VUR in congenital heart disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00018-8"
"natcardiovascres","A human cell atlas of the pressure-induced hypertrophic heart","Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is a leading cause of heart failure, but knowledge of the full repertoire of cardiac cells and their gene expression profiles in the human hypertrophic heart is missing. Here, by using large-scale single-nucleus transcriptomics, we present the transcriptional response of human cardiomyocytes to pressure overload caused by aortic valve stenosis and describe major alterations in cardiac cellular crosstalk. Hypertrophied cardiomyocytes had reduced input from endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Genes encoding Eph receptor tyrosine kinases, particularly EPHB1, were significantly downregulated in cardiomyocytes of the hypertrophied heart. Consequently, EPHB1 activation by its ligand ephrin (EFN)B2, which is mainly expressed by endothelial cells, was reduced. EFNB2 inhibited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro, while silencing its expression in endothelial cells induced hypertrophy in co-cultured cardiomyocytes. Our human cell atlas of the hypertrophied heart highlights the importance of intercellular crosstalk in disease pathogenesis and provides a valuable resource.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-022-00019-7"
"natcardiovascres","Foudroyant cerebral venous (sinus) thrombosis triggered through CLEC-2 and GPIIb/IIIa dependent platelet activation","Cerebral venous (sinus) thrombosis (CVT) is an unusual manifestation of venous thrombosis causing severe neurological impairment and seizures1,2. Molecular mechanisms underlying CVT, potentially involving pathological platelet activation, are unknown. Here we show that antibody-(INU1-fab)-induced cooperative signaling of two platelet receptors, C-type lectin-like receptor-2 (CLEC-2) and GPIIb/IIIa, triggers within minutes a CVT-like thrombotic syndrome in mice, characterized by tonic–myoclonic seizures, platelet consumption and death. Brain autopsy showed thrombi mainly in the cortical venules, but no intracranial hemorrhages or edema formation. Transcranial intravital microscopy revealed rapidly progressing thrombosis in the superior sagittal sinus, a main site of CVT in humans. Interfering with CLEC-2 signaling or inhibition of GPIIb/IIIa completely blocked platelet activation and CVT. Blocking GPIIb/IIIa after onset of neurological symptoms protected mice from platelet consumption, CVT and death, which was not seen after treatment with heparin. These results point to aberrant platelet activation as a major trigger of CVT and potential target for treatment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-021-00017-1"
"natcardiovascres","Aortic intimal resident macrophages are essential for maintenance of the non-thrombogenic intravascular state","Leukocytes and endothelial cells frequently cooperate to resolve inflammatory events. In most cases, these interactions are transient in nature and triggered by immunological insults. Here, we report that, in areas of disturbed blood flow, aortic endothelial cells permanently and intimately associate with a population of specialized macrophages. These macrophages are recruited at birth from the closing ductus arteriosus and share the luminal surface with the endothelium, becoming interwoven in the tunica intima. Anatomical changes that affect hemodynamics, such as in patent ductus arteriosus, alter macrophage seeding to coincide with regions of disturbed flow. Aortic resident macrophages expand in situ via direct cell renewal. Induced depletion of intimal macrophages leads to thrombin-mediated endothelial cell contraction, progressive fibrin accumulation and formation of microthrombi that, once dislodged, cause blockade of vessels in several organs. Together the findings reveal that intravascular resident macrophages are essential to regulate thrombin activity and clear fibrin deposits in regions of disturbed blood flow.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-021-00006-4"
"natcardiovascres","Bone marrow endothelial dysfunction promotes myeloid cell expansion in cardiovascular disease","Abnormal hematopoiesis advances cardiovascular disease by generating excess inflammatory leukocytes that attack the arteries and the heart. The bone marrow niche regulates hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and hence the systemic leukocyte pool, but whether cardiovascular disease affects the hematopoietic organ’s microvasculature is unknown. Here we show that hypertension, atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction (MI) instigate endothelial dysfunction, leakage, vascular fibrosis and angiogenesis in the bone marrow, altogether leading to overproduction of inflammatory myeloid cells and systemic leukocytosis. Limiting angiogenesis with endothelial deletion of Vegfr2 (encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor 2) curbed emergency hematopoiesis after MI. We noted that bone marrow endothelial cells assumed inflammatory transcriptional phenotypes in all examined stages of cardiovascular disease. Endothelial deletion of Il6 or Vcan (encoding versican), genes shown to be highly expressed in mice with atherosclerosis or MI, reduced hematopoiesis and systemic myeloid cell numbers in these conditions. Our findings establish that cardiovascular disease remodels the vascular bone marrow niche, stimulating hematopoiesis and production of inflammatory leukocytes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-021-00002-8"
