"natcatal","Engineered cytochrome P450 for direct arylalkene-to-ketone oxidation via highly reactive carbocation intermediates","Ketones are crucial intermediates in synthesis and frequent moieties in many products. The direct regioselective synthesis of ketones from internal alkenes could simplify synthetic routes and solve a long-standing challenge in catalysis. Here we report the laboratory evolution of a cytochrome P450 enzyme for the direct oxidation of internal arylalkenes to ketones with several thousand turnovers. This evolved ketone synthase benefits from 15 crucial mutations, most of them distal to the active site. Computational analysis revealed that all these mutations collaborate to generate and tame a highly reactive carbocation intermediate. This is achieved through a confined, rigid, and geometrically and electrostatically preorganized active site. The engineered enzyme exploits a metal–oxo species for ketone synthesis and enables various challenging alkene functionalization reactions. This includes the catalytic, enantioselective oxidation of internal alkenes to ketones and formal asymmetric hydrofunctionalizations of internal alkenes in combination with other biocatalysts.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-023-00979-4"
"natcatal","Methyl formate as a hydrogen energy carrier","The use of renewable energy is central for the realization of a circular economy, which is essential for further global economic development. In this background, hydrogen storage materials play an important role. Here we propose a previously overlooked, industrially available bulk chemical (methyl formate, MF) as an efficient and practical hydrogen storage material. Utilizing appropriate catalysts, hydrogen production from MF is significantly faster than with other established chemical hydrogen carriers, such as formic acid and methanol, under very mild conditions. The optimized MF dehydrogenation system presented here is highly active (maximum turnover frequency (TOFmax) > 44,000 h−1 and turnover number > 100,000) and selective (CO undetectable). Moreover, the solvent-free MF dehydrogenation demonstrates its application potential. Here we show the dehydrogenation reaction of MF. We expect that these insights will serve as an inspiration for the development of alternative energy materials and new catalytic transformations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-023-00959-8"
"natcatal","Molecular basis for carrier protein-dependent amide bond formation in the biosynthesis of lincosamide antibiotics","In the biosynthesis of the lincosamide antibiotic celesticetin, the condensation enzyme CcbD generates the lincosamide pharmacophore by forming an amide bond between the carrier protein (CP)-tethered proline and ergothioneine-conjugated thiooctose. Although the function of CcbD has been investigated, its substrate specificity, structures and catalytic mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show the structure–function analyses of CcbD. Our biochemical analysis revealed that CcbD exhibits promiscuous substrate specificity towards CP-tethered acyl substrates to generate unnatural lincosamides. Furthermore, structural analyses indicated that CcbD possesses an unusual overall fold, while the N-terminal region shows weak similarity to cysteine proteases. Thus, CcbD, like cysteine proteases, utilizes the Cys-His-Glu catalytic triad to form amide bonds in a CP-dependent manner, which is significantly different from other known amide bond-forming enzymes. Furthermore, the structures of the CcbD/thiooctose complex and the cross-linked CcbD/CcbZ-CP complex, as well as structure-based mutagenesis, revealed the intimate structural details of the CP-dependent amide bond formation reaction.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-023-00971-y"
"natcatal","Three-dimensional nanoimaging of fuel cell catalyst layers","Catalyst layers in proton exchange membrane fuel cells consist of platinum-group-metal nanocatalysts supported on carbon aggregates, forming a porous structure through which an ionomer network percolates. The local structural character of these heterogeneous assemblies is directly linked to the mass-transport resistances and subsequent cell performance losses; its three-dimensional visualization is therefore of interest. Herein we implement deep-learning-aided cryogenic transmission electron tomography for image restoration, and we quantitatively investigate the full morphology of various catalyst layers at the local-reaction-site scale. The analysis enables computation of metrics such as the ionomer morphology, coverage and homogeneity, location of platinum on the carbon supports, and platinum accessibility to the ionomer network, with the results directly compared and validated with experimental measurements. We expect that our findings and methodology for evaluating catalyst layer architectures will contribute towards linking the morphology to transport properties and overall fuel cell performance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-023-00947-y"
"natcatal","Ultrasmall amorphous zirconia nanoparticles catalyse polyolefin hydrogenolysis","Carbon–carbon bond cleavage reactions, adapted to deconstruct aliphatic hydrocarbon polymers and recover the intrinsic energy and carbon value in plastic waste, have typically been catalysed by metal nanoparticles or air-sensitive organometallics. Metal oxides that serve as supports for these catalysts are typically considered to be inert. Here we show that Earth-abundant, non-reducible zirconia catalyses the hydrogenolysis of polyolefins with activity rivalling that of precious metal nanoparticles. To harness this unusual reactivity, our catalytic architecture localizes ultrasmall amorphous zirconia nanoparticles between two fused platelets of mesoporous silica. Macromolecules translocate from bulk through radial mesopores to the highly active zirconia particles, where the chains undergo selective hydrogenolytic cleavage into a narrow, C18-centred distribution. Calculations indicated that C–H bond heterolysis across a Zr–O bond of a Zr(O)2 adatom model for unsaturated surface sites gives a zirconium hydrocarbyl, which cleaves a C–C bond via β-alkyl elimination.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-023-00910-x"
"natcatal","Anti-Markovnikov hydrochlorination and hydronitrooxylation of α-olefins via visible-light photocatalysis","Conventional hydrofunctionalization of α-olefins with mineral acids proceeds with Markovnikov selectivity to afford branched isomers. The direct formation of linear constitutional isomers is challenging, yet anti-Markovnikov addition would be valuable for the synthesis of commodity chemicals, such as primary alcohols, which are currently only accessible via stoichiometric redox reactions, with a full equivalent of waste of both oxidant and reductant. Strategies that utilize radical intermediates have been demonstrated, but only for activated alkenes, and the direct use of aqueous mineral acids remains elusive. Here we present anti-Markovnikov addition reactions of aqueous hydrochloric and nitric acid to unactivated alkenes. The transformation is enabled by the in situ generation of photoredox-active ion pairs, derived from acridine and the mineral acid, as a combined charge- and phase-transfer catalyst. The introduction of a hydrogen atom transfer catalyst enabled us to bypass the challenging chain propagation by hydrochloric and nitric acids that originates from the high bond dissociation energy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-023-00914-7"
"natcatal","Molecular mechanism of topoisomerase poisoning by the peptide antibiotic albicidin","The peptide antibiotic albicidin is a DNA topoisomerase inhibitor with low-nanomolar bactericidal activity towards fluoroquinolone-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. However, its mode of action is poorly understood. We determined a 2.6 Å resolution cryoelectron microscopy structure of a ternary complex between Escherichia coli topoisomerase DNA gyrase, a 217 bp double-stranded DNA fragment and albicidin. Albicidin employs a dual binding mechanism where one end of the molecule obstructs the crucial gyrase dimer interface, while the other intercalates between the fragments of cleaved DNA substrate. Thus, albicidin efficiently locks DNA gyrase, preventing it from religating DNA and completing its catalytic cycle. Two additional structures of this trapped state were determined using synthetic albicidin analogues that demonstrate improved solubility, and activity against a range of gyrase variants and E. coli topoisomerase IV. The extraordinary promiscuity of the DNA-intercalating region of albicidins and their excellent performance against fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria holds great promise for the development of last-resort antibiotics.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-022-00904-1"
"natcatal","Electrocatalytic hydrogenation of alkenes with Pd/carbon nanotubes at an oil–water interface","Electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) produces high-value chemicals from unsaturated organics using water as a hydrogen source. However, ECH is limited by the low solubility of substrates when operated under aqueous conditions, by electrical losses when performed in organic electrolytes and, in general, by low faradaic efficiency and fastidious work-up. Here, we show that a Pickering emulsion compartmenting organic substrates and aqueous electrolytes in different phases enables efficient ECH at the interface. We designed a construct comprising Pd nanoparticles immobilized on positively charged carbon nanotubes that localizes at the interface to act as both emulsion stabilizer and electrocatalyst. Applied to the ECH of styrene, the system delivers ethylbenzene at high faradaic efficiency (95.0%) and mass specific current density (–148.1 mA  \({{{\mathrm{mg}}}}_{{{{\mathrm{Pd}}}}}^{ - 1}\)). The system combines good substrate solubility, high conductivity and simplified product isolation, and has proved applicable to the conversion of various alkenes. This strategy may thus provide alternative solutions to the ECH of substrates with low water solubility, such as bio-oil and bio-crude.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-022-00882-4"
"natcatal","On the origin of multihole oxygen evolution in haematite photoanodes","The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) plays a crucial role in (photo)electrochemical devices that use renewable energy to produce synthetic fuels. Recent measurements on semiconducting oxides have found a power law dependence of the OER rate on surface hole density, suggesting a multihole mechanism. In this study, using transient photocurrent measurements, density functional theory simulations and microkinetic modelling, we have uncovered the origin of this behaviour in haematite. We show here that the OER rate has a third-order dependence on the surface hole density. We propose a mechanism wherein the reaction proceeds by accumulating oxidizing equivalents through a sequence of one-electron oxidations of surface hydroxy groups. The key O–O bond formation step occurs by the dissociative chemisorption of a hydroxide ion involving three oxyl sites. At variance with the case of metallic oxides, the activation energy of this step is weakly dependent on the surface hole coverage, leading to the observed power law.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-022-00845-9"
"natcatal","A kinetic descriptor for the electrolyte effect on the oxygen reduction kinetics on Pt(111)","Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells demand efficient electrode–electrolyte interfaces to catalyse the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), the kinetics of which depends on the energetics of surface adsorption and on electrolyte environment. Here we show an unanticipated effect of non-specifically adsorbed anions on the ORR kinetics on a Pt(111) electrode; these trends do not follow the usual ORR descriptor, that is *OH binding energy. We propose a voltammetry-accessible descriptor, namely reversibility of the *O ↔ *OH transition. This descriptor tracks the dependence of ORR rates on electrolyte, including the concentration/identity of anions in acidic media, cations in alkaline media and the effect of ionomers. We propose a model that relates the ORR rate on Pt(111) to the rate of the *O to *OH transition, in addition to the thermodynamic *OH binding energy descriptor. Our model also rationalizes different trends for the ORR rate on stepped Pt surfaces in acidic versus alkaline media.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-022-00810-6"
"natcatal","Elucidation of radical- and oxygenate-driven paths in zeolite-catalysed conversion of methanol and methyl chloride to hydrocarbons","Understanding hydrocarbon generation in the zeolite-catalysed conversions of methanol and methyl chloride requires advanced spectroscopic approaches to distinguish the complex mechanisms governing C–C bond formation, chain growth and the deposition of carbonaceous species. Here operando photoelectron photoion coincidence (PEPICO) spectroscopy enables the isomer-selective identification of pathways to hydrocarbons of up to C14 in size, providing direct experimental evidence of methyl radicals in both reactions and ketene in the methanol-to-hydrocarbons reaction. Both routes converge to C5 molecules that transform into aromatics. Operando PEPICO highlights distinctions in the prevalence of coke precursors, which is supported by electron paramagnetic resonance measurements, providing evidence of differences in the representative molecular structure, density and distribution of accumulated carbonaceous species. Radical-driven pathways in the methyl chloride-to-hydrocarbons reaction(s) accelerate the formation of extended aromatic systems, leading to fast deactivation. By contrast, the generation of alkylated species through oxygenate-driven pathways in the methanol-to-hydrocarbons reaction extends the catalyst lifetime. The findings demonstrate the potential of the presented methods to provide valuable mechanistic insights into complex reaction networks.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-022-00808-0"
"natcatal","Deep learning-based kcat prediction enables improved enzyme-constrained model reconstruction","Enzyme turnover numbers (kcat) are key to understanding cellular metabolism, proteome allocation and physiological diversity, but experimentally measured kcat data are sparse and noisy. Here we provide a deep learning approach (DLKcat) for high-throughput kcat prediction for metabolic enzymes from any organism merely from substrate structures and protein sequences. DLKcat can capture kcat changes for mutated enzymes and identify amino acid residues with a strong impact on kcat values. We applied this approach to predict genome-scale kcat values for more than 300 yeast species. Additionally, we designed a Bayesian pipeline to parameterize enzyme-constrained genome-scale metabolic models from predicted kcat values. The resulting models outperformed the corresponding original enzyme-constrained genome-scale metabolic models from previous pipelines in predicting phenotypes and proteomes, and enabled us to explain phenotypic differences. DLKcat and the enzyme-constrained genome-scale metabolic model construction pipeline are valuable tools to uncover global trends of enzyme kinetics and physiological diversity, and to further elucidate cellular metabolism on a large scale.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-022-00798-z"
"natcatal","Atomically dispersed Pt and Fe sites and Pt–Fe nanoparticles for durable proton exchange membrane fuel cells","Proton exchange membrane fuel cells convert hydrogen and oxygen into electricity without emissions. The high cost and low durability of Pt-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction hinder their wide application, and the development of non-precious metal electrocatalysts is limited by their low performance. Here we design a hybrid electrocatalyst that consists of atomically dispersed Pt and Fe single atoms and Pt–Fe alloy nanoparticles. Its Pt mass activity is 3.7 times higher than that of commercial Pt/C in a fuel cell. More importantly, the fuel cell with a low Pt loading in the cathode (0.015 mgPt cm−2) shows an excellent durability, with a 97% activity retention after 100,000 cycles and no noticeable current drop at 0.6 V for over 200 hours. These results highlight the importance of the synergistic effects among active sites in hybrid electrocatalysts and provide an alternative way to design more active and durable low-Pt electrocatalysts for electrochemical devices.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-022-00796-1"
"natcatal","Facile access to fused 2D/3D rings via intermolecular cascade dearomative [2 + 2] cycloaddition/rearrangement reactions of quinolines with alkenes","Hybrid fused two-dimensional/three-dimensional (2D/3D) rings are important pharmacophores in drugs owing to their unique structural and physicochemical properties. Preparation of these strained ring systems often requires elaborate synthetic effort and exhibits low efficiency, thus representing a limiting factor in drug discovery. Here, we report two types of energy-transfer-mediated cascade dearomative [2 + 2] cycloaddition/rearrangement reactions of quinoline derivatives with alkenes, which provide a straightforward avenue to 2D/3D pyridine-fused 6−5−4−3- and 6−4−6-membered ring systems. Notably, this energy-transfer-mediated strategy features excellent diastereoselectivity that bypasses the general reactivity and selectivity issues of photochemical [2 + 2] cycloaddition of various other aromatics. Tuning the aza-arene substitutions enabled selective diversion of the iridium photocatalysed energy transfer manifold towards either cyclopropanation or cyclobutane-rearrangement products. Density functional theory calculations revealed a cascade energy transfer scenario to be operative.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-022-00784-5"
"natcatal","Intramolecular hydroxyl nucleophilic attack pathway by a polymeric water oxidation catalyst with single cobalt sites","Exploration of efficient water oxidation catalysts (WOCs) is the primary challenge in conversion of renewable energy into fuels. Here we report a molecularly well-defined heterogeneous WOC with Aza-fused, π-conjugated, microporous polymer (Aza-CMP) coordinated single cobalt sites (Aza-CMP-Co). The single cobalt sites in Aza-CMP-Co exhibited superior activity under alkaline and near-neutral conditions. Moreover, the molecular nature of the isolated catalytic sites makes Aza-CMP-Co a reliable model for studying the heterogeneous water oxidation mechanism. By a combination of experimental and theoretical results, a pH-dependent nucleophilic attack pathway for O-O bond formation was proposed. Under alkaline conditions, the intramolecular hydroxyl nucleophilic attack (IHNA) process with which the adjacent -OH group nucleophilically attacks Co4+=O was identified as the rate-determining step. This process leads to lower activation energy and accelerated kinetics than those of the intermolecular water nucleophilic attack (WNA) pathway. This study provides significant insights into the crucial function of electrolyte pH in water oxidation catalysis and enhancement of water oxidation activity by regulation of the IHNA pathway.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-022-00783-6"
"natcatal","Steering the structure and selectivity of CO2 electroreduction catalysts by potential pulses","Convoluted selectivity trends and a missing link between reaction product distribution and catalyst properties hinder practical applications of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) for multicarbon product generation. Here we employ operando X-ray absorption and X-ray diffraction methods with subsecond time resolution to unveil the surprising complexity of catalysts exposed to dynamic reaction conditions. We show that by using a pulsed reaction protocol consisting of alternating working and oxidizing potential periods that dynamically perturb catalysts derived from Cu2O nanocubes, one can decouple the effect of the ensemble of coexisting copper species on the product distribution. In particular, an optimized dynamic balance between oxidized and reduced copper surface species achieved within a narrow range of cathodic and anodic pulse durations resulted in a twofold increase in ethanol production compared with static CO2RR conditions. This work thus prepares the ground for steering catalyst selectivity through dynamically controlled structural and chemical transformations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-022-00760-z"
"natcatal","A cell-free self-replenishing CO2-fixing system","Biological CO2 fixation is so far the most effective means for CO2 reduction at scale and accounts for most of the CO2 fixed on Earth. Through this process, carbon is fixed in cellular components and biomass during organismal growth. To uncouple CO2 fixation from growth and cellular regulation, cell-free CO2 fixation systems represent an alternative approach since the rate can be independently manipulated. Here we designed an oxygen-insensitive, self-replenishing CO2 fixation system with opto-sensing. The system comprises a synthetic reductive glyoxylate and pyruvate synthesis (rGPS) cycle and the malyl-CoA-glycerate (MCG) pathway to produce acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), pyruvate and malate from CO2, which are also intermediates in the cycle. We solved various problems associated with the in vitro system, and implemented opto-sensing modules to control the regeneration of cofactors. We accomplished sustained operation for 6 hours with a CO2-fixing rate comparable to or greater than typical CO2 fixation rates of photosynthetic or lithoautotrophic organisms.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-022-00746-x"
"natcatal","Silica-supported Fe/Fe–O nanoparticles for the catalytic hydrogenation of nitriles to amines in the presence of aluminium additives","The hydrogenation of nitriles to amines represents an important and frequently used industrial process due to the broad applicability of the resulting products in chemistry and life sciences. Despite the existing portfolio of catalysts reported for the hydrogenation of nitriles, the development of iron-based heterogeneous catalysts for this process is still a challenge. Here, we show that the impregnation and pyrolysis of iron(II) acetate on commercial silica produces a reusable Fe/Fe–O@SiO2 catalyst with a well-defined structure comprising the fayalite phase at the Si–Fe interface and α-Fe nanoparticles, covered by an ultrathin amorphous iron(III) oxide layer, growing from the silica matrix. These Fe/Fe–O core–shell nanoparticles, in the presence of catalytic amounts of aluminium additives, promote the hydrogenation of all kinds of nitriles, including structurally challenging and functionally diverse aromatic, heterocyclic, aliphatic and fatty nitriles, to produce primary amines under scalable and industrially viable conditions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-021-00722-x"
"natcatal","Switchable wetting of oxygen-evolving oxide catalysts","The surface wettability of catalysts is typically controlled via surface treatments that promote catalytic performance. Here we report on potential-regulated hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity at cobalt-based oxide interfaces with an alkaline solution. The switchable wetting of single particles, directly related to their activity and stability towards the oxygen evolution reaction, was revealed by electrochemical liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy. Analysis of the movement of the liquid in real time revealed distinctive wettability behaviour associated with specific potential ranges. At low potentials, an overall reduction of the hydrophobicity of the oxides was probed. Upon reversible reconstruction towards the surface oxyhydroxide phase, electrowetting was found to cause a change in the interfacial capacitance. At high potentials, the evolution of molecular oxygen, confirmed by operando electron energy-loss spectroscopy, was accompanied by a globally thinner liquid layer. This work directly links the physical wetting with the chemical oxygen evolution reaction of single particles, providing fundamental insights into solid–liquid interfacial interactions of oxygen-evolving oxides.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-021-00723-w"
"natcatal","Lewis acid-mediated Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction","The palladium-catalysed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of organohalides and organoborons is a reliable method for carbon–carbon bond formation. This reaction involves a base-mediated transmetalation process, but the presence of a base also promotes competitive protodeborylation. Herein, we established a Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction via Lewis acid-mediated transmetalation of an organopalladium(II) intermediate with organoborons. Experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the controlled release of the transmetalation-active intermediate enables base-independent transmetalation under heating conditions and enhances the applicable scope of this process. This system enables us to avoid the addition of a traditional base and, thus, renders substrates with base-sensitive moieties available. Results from this research further expand the overall utility of cross-coupling chemistry.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-021-00719-6"
"natcatal","Harnessing the ambiphilicity of silyl nitronates in a catalytic asymmetric approach to aliphatic β3-amino acids","Nitronate anions, formally generated by α-deprotonating the corresponding nitroalkanes, are highly nucleophilic and versatile intermediates in many carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions. In contrast, the corresponding silyl nitronates are ambiphilic and react, at the same carbon atom, with both electrophiles and nucleophiles. However, while their nucleophilicity has been well exploited in catalytic enantioselective reactions with imines and aldehydes, utilizing the electrophilicity of silyl nitronates in asymmetric synthesis has remained elusive. Here we report the facile, efficient and general reactivity of readily available silyl nitronates with silyl ketene acetals, catalysed by highly Lewis-acidic and confined silylium imidodiphosphorimidate catalysts. The products of this reaction, so-called nitroso acetals, are obtained in excellent enantioselectivity and can be easily converted into N-Boc-β3-amino acid esters in a single step.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-021-00714-x"
"natcatal","DYW domain structures imply an unusual regulation principle in plant organellar RNA editing catalysis","RNA editosomes selectively deaminate cytidines to uridines in plant organellar transcripts—mostly to restore protein functionality and consequently facilitate mitochondrial and chloroplast function. The RNA editosomal pentatricopeptide repeat proteins serve target RNA recognition, whereas the intensively studied DYW domain elicits catalysis. Here we present structures and functional data of a DYW domain in an inactive ground state and activated. DYW domains harbour a cytidine deaminase fold and a C-terminal DYW motif, with catalytic and structural zinc atoms, respectively. A conserved gating domain within the deaminase fold regulates the active site sterically and mechanistically in a process that we termed gated zinc shutter. Based on the structures, an autoinhibited ground state and its activation are cross-validated by RNA editing assays and differential scanning fluorimetry. We anticipate that, in vivo, the framework of an active plant RNA editosome triggers the release of DYW autoinhibition to ensure a controlled and coordinated cytidine deamination playing a key role in mitochondrial and chloroplast homeostasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-021-00633-x"
"natcatal","A new-to-nature carboxylation module to improve natural and synthetic CO2 fixation","The capture of CO2 by carboxylases is key to sustainable biocatalysis and a carbon-neutral bio-economy, yet currently limited to few naturally existing enzymes. Here, we developed glycolyl-CoA carboxylase (GCC), a new-to-nature enzyme, by combining rational design, high-throughput microfluidics and microplate screens. During this process, GCC’s catalytic efficiency improved by three orders of magnitude to match the properties of natural CO2-fixing enzymes. We verified our active-site redesign with an atomic-resolution, 1.96-Å cryo-electron microscopy structure and engineered two more enzymes that, together with GCC, form a carboxylation module for the conversion of glycolate (C2) to glycerate (C3). We demonstrate how this module can be interfaced with natural photorespiration, ethylene glycol conversion and synthetic CO2 fixation. Based on stoichiometrical calculations, GCC is predicted to increase the carbon efficiency of all of these processes by up to 150% while reducing their theoretical energy demand, showcasing how expanding the solution space of natural metabolism provides new opportunities for biotechnology and agriculture.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41929-020-00557-y"
