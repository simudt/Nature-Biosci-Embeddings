Here we combine cell-type-specific mitochondrial proteomics with in vivo biosensor imaging to dissect how inflammation alters the molecular composition and functional capacity of neuronal mitochondria. We show that neuroinflammatory lesions in the mouse spinal cord cause widespread and persisting axonal ATP deficiency, which precedes mitochondrial oxidation and calcium overload. This axonal energy deficiency is associated with impaired electron transport chain function, but also an upstream imbalance of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes, with several, including key rate-limiting, enzymes being depleted in neuronal mitochondria in experimental models and in MS lesions. Notably, viral overexpression of individual TCA enzymes can ameliorate the axonal energy deficits in neuroinflammatory lesions, suggesting that TCA cycle dysfunction in MS may be amendable to therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00838-3"
"natmetab","Commensal bacteria weaken the intestinal barrier by suppressing epithelial neuropilin-1 and Hedgehog signaling","The gut microbiota influences intestinal barrier integrity through mechanisms that are incompletely understood. Here we show that the commensal microbiota weakens the intestinal barrier by suppressing epithelial neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Microbial colonization of germ-free mice dampens signaling of the intestinal Hh pathway through epithelial Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, resulting in decreased epithelial NRP1 protein levels. Following activation via TLR2/TLR6, epithelial NRP1, a positive-feedback regulator of Hh signaling, is lysosomally degraded. Conversely, elevated epithelial NRP1 levels in germ-free mice are associated with a strengthened gut barrier. Functionally, intestinal epithelial cell-specific Nrp1 deficiency (Nrp1ΔIEC) results in decreased Hh pathway activity and a weakened gut barrier. In addition, Nrp1ΔIEC mice have a reduced density of capillary networks in their small intestinal villus structures. Collectively, our results reveal a role for the commensal microbiota and epithelial NRP1 signaling in the regulation of intestinal barrier function through postnatal control of Hh signaling.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00828-5"
"natmetab","Human resident liver myeloid cells protect against metabolic stress in obesity","Although multiple populations of macrophages have been described in the human liver, their function and turnover in patients with obesity at high risk of developing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cirrhosis are currently unknown. Herein, we identify a specific human population of resident liver myeloid cells that protects against the metabolic impairment associated with obesity. By studying the turnover of liver myeloid cells in individuals undergoing liver transplantation, we find that liver myeloid cell turnover differs between humans and mice. Using single-cell techniques and flow cytometry, we determine that the proportion of the protective resident liver myeloid cells, denoted liver myeloid cells 2 (LM2), decreases during obesity. Functional validation approaches using human 2D and 3D cultures reveal that the presence of LM2 ameliorates the oxidative stress associated with obese conditions. Our study indicates that resident myeloid cells could be a therapeutic target to decrease the oxidative stress associated with NAFLD.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00834-7"
"natmetab","An ATP-sensitive phosphoketolase regulates carbon fixation in cyanobacteria","Regulation of CO2 fixation in cyanobacteria is important both for the organism and global carbon balance. Here we show that phosphoketolase in Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942 (SeXPK) possesses a distinct ATP-sensing mechanism, where a drop in ATP level allows SeXPK to divert precursors of the RuBisCO substrate away from the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle. Deleting the SeXPK gene increased CO2 fixation particularly during light–dark transitions. In high-density cultures, the Δxpk strain showed a 60% increase in carbon fixation and unexpectedly resulted in sucrose secretion without any pathway engineering. Using cryo-EM analysis, we discovered that these functions were enabled by a unique allosteric regulatory site involving two subunits jointly binding two ATP, which constantly suppresses the activity of SeXPK until the ATP level drops. This magnesium-independent ATP allosteric site is present in many species across all three domains of life, where it may also play important regulatory functions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00831-w"
"natmetab","Wnt signaling preserves progenitor cell multipotency during adipose tissue development","Mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells are essential for tissue development and repair throughout life, but how they are maintained under chronic differentiation pressure is not known. Using single-cell transcriptomics of human progenitor cells we find that adipose differentiation stimuli elicit two cellular trajectories: one toward mature adipocytes and another toward a pool of non-differentiated cells that maintain progenitor characteristics. These cells are induced by transient Wnt pathway activation and express numerous extracellular matrix genes and are therefore named structural Wnt-regulated adipose tissue cells. We find that the genetic signature of structural Wnt-regulated adipose tissue cells is present in adult human adipose tissue and adipose tissue developed from human progenitor cells in mice. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby adipose differentiation occurs concurrently with the maintenance of a mesenchymal progenitor cell pool, ensuring tissue development, repair and appropriate metabolic control over the lifetime.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00813-y"
"natmetab","Adipogenic and SWAT cells separate from a common progenitor in human brown and white adipose depots","Adipocyte function is a major determinant of metabolic disease, warranting investigations of regulating mechanisms. We show at single-cell resolution that progenitor cells from four human brown and white adipose depots separate into two main cell fates, an adipogenic and a structural branch, developing from a common progenitor. The adipogenic gene signature contains mitochondrial activity genes, and associates with genome-wide association study traits for fat distribution. Based on an extracellular matrix and developmental gene signature, we name the structural branch of cells structural Wnt-regulated adipose tissue-resident (SWAT) cells. When stripped from adipogenic cells, SWAT cells display a multipotent phenotype by reverting towards progenitor state or differentiating into new adipogenic cells, dependent on media. Label transfer algorithms recapitulate the cell types in human adipose tissue datasets. In conclusion, we provide a differentiation map of human adipocytes and define the multipotent SWAT cell, providing a new perspective on adipose tissue regulation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00820-z"
"natmetab","A multimodal atlas of tumour metabolism reveals the architecture of gene–metabolite covariation","Tumour metabolism is controlled by coordinated changes in metabolite abundance and gene expression, but simultaneous quantification of metabolites and transcripts in primary tissue is rare. To overcome this limitation and to study gene–metabolite covariation in cancer, we assemble the Cancer Atlas of Metabolic Profiles of metabolomic and transcriptomic data from 988 tumour and control specimens spanning 11 cancer types in published and newly generated datasets. Meta-analysis of the Cancer Atlas of Metabolic Profiles reveals two classes of gene–metabolite covariation that transcend cancer types. The first corresponds to gene–metabolite pairs engaged in direct enzyme–substrate interactions, identifying putative genes controlling metabolite pool sizes. A second class of gene–metabolite covariation represents a small number of hub metabolites, including quinolinate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which correlate to many genes specifically expressed in immune cell populations. These results provide evidence that gene–metabolite covariation in cellularly heterogeneous tissue arises, in part, from both mechanistic interactions between genes and metabolites, and from remodelling of the bulk metabolome in specific immune microenvironments.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00817-8"
"natmetab","Itaconic acid underpins hepatocyte lipid metabolism in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in male mice","Itaconate, the product of the decarboxylation of cis-aconitate, regulates numerous biological processes. We and others have revealed itaconate as a regulator of fatty acid β-oxidation, generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and the metabolic interplay between resident macrophages and tumors. In the present study, we show that itaconic acid is upregulated in human non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and a mouse model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Male mice deficient in the gene responsible for itaconate production (immunoresponsive gene (Irg)-1) have exacerbated lipid accumulation in the liver, glucose and insulin intolerance and mesenteric fat deposition. Treatment of mice with the itaconate derivative, 4-octyl itaconate, reverses dyslipidemia associated with high-fat diet feeding. Mechanistically, itaconate treatment of primary hepatocytes reduces lipid accumulation and increases their oxidative phosphorylation in a manner dependent upon fatty acid oxidation. We propose a model whereby macrophage-derived itaconate acts in trans upon hepatocytes to modulate the liver’s ability to metabolize fatty acids.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00801-2"
"natmetab","The incretin co-agonist tirzepatide requires GIPR for hormone secretion from human islets","The incretins glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) mediate insulin responses that are proportionate to nutrient intake to facilitate glucose tolerance1. The GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is an established drug target for the treatment of diabetes and obesity2, whereas the therapeutic potential of the GIP receptor (GIPR) is a subject of debate. Tirzepatide is an agonist at both the GIPR and GLP-1R and is a highly effective treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity3,4. However, although tirzepatide activates GIPR in cell lines and mouse models, it is not clear whether or how dual agonism contributes to its therapeutic benefit. Islet beta cells express both the GLP-1R and the GIPR, and insulin secretion is an established mechanism by which incretin agonists improve glycemic control5. Here, we show that in mouse islets, tirzepatide stimulates insulin secretion predominantly through the GLP-1R, owing to reduced potency at the mouse GIPR. However, in human islets, antagonizing GIPR activity consistently decreases the insulin response to tirzepatide. Moreover, tirzepatide enhances glucagon secretion and somatostatin secretion in human islets. These data demonstrate that tirzepatide stimulates islet hormone secretion from human islets through both incretin receptors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00811-0"
"natmetab","Induction of a torpor-like hypothermic and hypometabolic state in rodents by ultrasound","Torpor is an energy-conserving state in which animals dramatically decrease their metabolic rate and body temperature to survive harsh environmental conditions. Here, we report the noninvasive, precise and safe induction of a torpor-like hypothermic and hypometabolic state in rodents by remote transcranial ultrasound stimulation at the hypothalamus preoptic area (POA). We achieve a long-lasting (>24 h) torpor-like state in mice via closed-loop feedback control of ultrasound stimulation with automated detection of body temperature. Ultrasound-induced hypothermia and hypometabolism (UIH) is triggered by activation of POA neurons, involves the dorsomedial hypothalamus as a downstream brain region and subsequent inhibition of thermogenic brown adipose tissue. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of POA neurons reveals TRPM2 as an ultrasound-sensitive ion channel, the knockdown of which suppresses UIH. We also demonstrate that UIH is feasible in a non-torpid animal, the rat. Our findings establish UIH as a promising technology for the noninvasive and safe induction of a torpor-like state.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00804-z"
"natmetab","Metabolic landscape of the male mouse gut identifies different niches determined by microbial activities","Distinct niches of the mammalian gut are populated by diverse microbiota, but the contribution of spatial variation to intestinal metabolism remains unclear. Here we present a map of the longitudinal metabolome along the gut of healthy colonized and germ-free male mice. With this map, we reveal a general shift from amino acids in the small intestine to organic acids, vitamins and nucleotides in the large intestine. We compare the metabolic landscapes in colonized versus germ-free mice to disentangle the origin of many metabolites in different niches, which in some cases allows us to infer the underlying processes or identify the producing species. Beyond the known impact of diet on the small intestinal metabolic niche, distinct spatial patterns suggest specific microbial influence on the metabolome in the small intestine. Thus, we present a map of intestinal metabolism and identify metabolite–microbe associations, which provide a basis to connect the spatial occurrence of bioactive compounds to host or microorganism metabolism.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00802-1"
"natmetab","Salvage of ribose from uridine or RNA supports glycolysis in nutrient-limited conditions","Glucose is vital for life, serving as both a source of energy and carbon building block for growth. When glucose is limiting, alternative nutrients must be harnessed. To identify mechanisms by which cells can tolerate complete loss of glucose, we performed nutrient-sensitized genome-wide genetic screens and a PRISM growth assay across 482 cancer cell lines. We report that catabolism of uridine from the medium enables the growth of cells in the complete absence of glucose. While previous studies have shown that uridine can be salvaged to support pyrimidine synthesis in the setting of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation deficiency1, our work demonstrates that the ribose moiety of uridine or RNA can be salvaged to fulfil energy requirements via a pathway based on: (1) the phosphorylytic cleavage of uridine by uridine phosphorylase UPP1/UPP2 into uracil and ribose-1-phosphate (R1P), (2) the conversion of uridine-derived R1P into fructose-6-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P by the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway and (3) their glycolytic utilization to fuel ATP production, biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis. Capacity for glycolysis from uridine-derived ribose appears widespread, and we confirm its activity in cancer lineages, primary macrophages and mice in vivo. An interesting property of this pathway is that R1P enters downstream of the initial, highly regulated steps of glucose transport and upper glycolysis. We anticipate that ‘uridine bypass’ of upper glycolysis could be important in the context of disease and even exploited for therapeutic purposes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00774-2"
"natmetab","SIRT2 regulates extracellular vesicle-mediated liver–bone communication","The interplay between liver and bone metabolism remains largely uncharacterized. Here, we uncover a mechanism of liver-bone crosstalk regulated by hepatocyte SIRT2. We demonstrate that hepatocyte SIRT2 expression is increased in aged mice and elderly humans. Liver-specific SIRT2 deficiency inhibits osteoclastogenesis and alleviates bone loss in mouse models of osteoporosis. We identify leucine-rich α-2-glycoprotein 1 (LRG1) as a functional cargo in hepatocyte-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). In SIRT2-deficient hepatocytes, LRG1 levels in sEVs are upregulated, leading to increased transfer of LRG1 to bone-marrow-derived monocytes (BMDMs), and in turn, to inhibition of osteoclast differentiation via reduced nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65. Treatment with sEVs carrying high levels of LRG1 inhibits osteoclast differentiation in human BMDMs and in mice with osteoporosis, resulting in attenuated bone loss in mice. Furthermore, the plasma level of sEVs carrying LRG1 is positively correlated with bone mineral density in humans. Thus, drugs targeting hepatocyte-osteoclast communication may constitute a promising therapeutic strategy for primary osteoporosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00803-0"
"natmetab","Human metabolome variation along the upper intestinal tract","Most processing of the human diet occurs in the small intestine. Metabolites in the small intestine originate from host secretions, plus the ingested exposome1 and microbial transformations. Here we probe the spatiotemporal variation of upper intestinal luminal contents during routine daily digestion in 15 healthy male and female participants. For this, we use a non-invasive, ingestible sampling device to collect and analyse 274 intestinal samples and 60 corresponding stool homogenates by combining five mass spectrometry assays2,3 and 16S rRNA sequencing. We identify 1,909 metabolites, including sulfonolipids and fatty acid esters of hydroxy fatty acids (FAHFA) lipids. We observe that stool and intestinal metabolomes differ dramatically. Food metabolites display trends in dietary biomarkers, unexpected increases in dicarboxylic acids along the intestinal tract and a positive association between luminal keto acids and fruit intake. Diet-derived and microbially linked metabolites account for the largest inter-individual differences. Notably, two individuals who had taken antibiotics within 6 months before sampling show large variation in levels of bioactive FAHFAs and sulfonolipids and other microbially related metabolites. From inter-individual variation, we identify Blautia species as a candidate to be involved in FAHFA metabolism. In conclusion, non-invasive, in vivo sampling of the human small intestine and ascending colon under physiological conditions reveals links between diet, host and microbial metabolism.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00777-z"
"natmetab","Effects of different doses of exercise and diet-induced weight loss on beta-cell function in type 2 diabetes (DOSE-EX): a randomized clinical trial","Diet-induced weight loss is associated with improved beta-cell function in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) with remaining secretory capacity. It is unknown if adding exercise to diet-induced weight loss improves beta-cell function and if exercise volume is important for improving beta-cell function in this context. Here, we carried out a four-armed randomized trial with a total of 82 persons (35% females, mean age (s.d.) of 58.2 years (9.8)) with newly diagnosed T2D (<7 years). Participants were randomly allocated to standard care (n = 20), calorie restriction (25% energy reduction; n = 21), calorie restriction and exercise three times per week (n = 20), or calorie restriction and exercise six times per week (n = 21) for 16 weeks. The primary outcome was beta-cell function as indicated by the late-phase disposition index (insulin secretion multiplied by insulin sensitivity) at steady-state hyperglycemia during a hyperglycemic clamp. Secondary outcomes included glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and sensitivity as well as the disposition, insulin sensitivity, and secretion indices derived from a liquid mixed meal tolerance test. We show that the late-phase disposition index during the clamp increases more in all three intervention groups than in standard care (diet control group, 58%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 16 to 116; moderate exercise dose group, 105%; 95% CI, 49 to 182; high exercise dose group, 137%; 95% CI, 73 to 225) and follows a linear dose–response relationship (P > 0.001 for trend). We report three serious adverse events (two in the control group and one in the diet control group), as well as adverse events in two participants in the diet control group, and five participants each in the moderate and high exercise dose groups. Overall, adding an exercise intervention to diet-induced weight loss improves glucose-stimulated beta-cell function in people with newly diagnosed T2D in an exercise dose-dependent manner (NCT03769883).","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00799-7"
"natmetab","A proteo-transcriptomic map of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease signatures","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common, progressive liver disease strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome. It is unclear how progression of NAFLD towards cirrhosis translates into systematic changes in circulating proteins. Here, we provide a detailed proteo-transcriptomic map of steatohepatitis and fibrosis during progressive NAFLD. In this multicentre proteomic study, we characterize 4,730 circulating proteins in 306 patients with histologically characterized NAFLD and integrate this with transcriptomic analysis in paired liver tissue. We identify circulating proteomic signatures for active steatohepatitis and advanced fibrosis, and correlate these with hepatic transcriptomics to develop a proteo-transcriptomic signature of 31 markers. Deconvolution of this signature by single-cell RNA sequencing reveals the hepatic cell types likely to contribute to proteomic changes with disease progression. As an exemplar of use as a non-invasive diagnostic, logistic regression establishes a composite model comprising four proteins (ADAMTSL2, AKR1B10, CFHR4 and TREM2), body mass index and type 2 diabetes mellitus status, to identify at-risk steatohepatitis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00775-1"
"natmetab","The GAPDH redox switch safeguards reductive capacity and enables survival of stressed tumour cells","Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is known to contain an active-site cysteine residue undergoing oxidation in response to hydrogen peroxide, leading to rapid inactivation of the enzyme. Here we show that human and mouse cells expressing a GAPDH mutant lacking this redox switch retain catalytic activity but are unable to stimulate the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and enhance their reductive capacity. Specifically, we find that anchorage-independent growth of cells and spheroids is limited by an elevation of endogenous peroxide levels and is largely dependent on a functional GAPDH redox switch. Likewise, tumour growth in vivo is limited by peroxide stress and suppressed when the GAPDH redox switch is disabled in tumour cells. The induction of additional intratumoural oxidative stress by chemo- or radiotherapy synergized with the deactivation of the GAPDH redox switch. Mice lacking the GAPDH redox switch exhibit altered fatty acid metabolism in kidney and heart, apparently in compensation for the lack of the redox switch. Together, our findings demonstrate the physiological and pathophysiological relevance of oxidative GAPDH inactivation in mammals.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00781-3"
"natmetab","Triglyceride cycling enables modification of stored fatty acids","Triglyceride cycling is the process of continuous degradation and re-synthesis of triglyceride in cellular stores. We show in 3T3-L1 adipocytes that triglycerides are subject to rapid turnover and re-arrangement of fatty acids with an estimated half-life of 2–4 h. We develop a tracing technology that can simultaneously and quantitatively follow the metabolism of multiple fatty acids to study the triglyceride futile substrate cycle directly and with molecular species resolution. Our approach is based on alkyne fatty acid tracers and mass spectrometry. The triglyceride cycling is connected to modification of released fatty acids by elongation and desaturation. Through cycling and modification, saturated fatty acids are slowly converted to monounsaturated fatty acids, and linoleic acid to arachidonic acid. We conclude that triglyceride cycling renders stored fatty acids accessible for metabolic alteration. The overall process facilitates cellular adjustments to the stored fatty acid pool to meet changing needs of the cell.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00769-z"
"natmetab","Formate overflow drives toxic folate trapping in MTHFD1 inhibited cancer cells","Cancer cells fuel their increased need for nucleotide supply by upregulating one-carbon (1C) metabolism, including the enzymes methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase–cyclohydrolase 1 and 2 (MTHFD1 and MTHFD2). TH9619 is a potent inhibitor of dehydrogenase and cyclohydrolase activities in both MTHFD1 and MTHFD2, and selectively kills cancer cells. Here, we reveal that, in cells, TH9619 targets nuclear MTHFD2 but does not inhibit mitochondrial MTHFD2. Hence, overflow of formate from mitochondria continues in the presence of TH9619. TH9619 inhibits the activity of MTHFD1 occurring downstream of mitochondrial formate release, leading to the accumulation of 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate, which we term a ‘folate trap’. This results in thymidylate depletion and death of MTHFD2-expressing cancer cells. This previously uncharacterized folate trapping mechanism is exacerbated by physiological hypoxanthine levels that block the de novo purine synthesis pathway, and additionally prevent 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate consumption for purine synthesis. The folate trapping mechanism described here for TH9619 differs from other MTHFD1/2 inhibitors and antifolates. Thus, our findings uncover an approach to attack cancer and reveal a regulatory mechanism in 1C metabolism.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00771-5"
"natmetab","Primary cilia sense glutamine availability and respond via asparagine synthetase","Depriving cells of nutrients triggers an energetic crisis, which is resolved by metabolic rewiring and organelle reorganization. Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles at the cell surface, capable of integrating multiple metabolic and signalling cues, but their precise sensory function is not fully understood. Here we show that primary cilia respond to nutrient availability and adjust their length via glutamine-mediated anaplerosis facilitated by asparagine synthetase (ASNS). Nutrient deprivation causes cilia elongation, mediated by reduced mitochondrial function, ATP availability and AMPK activation independently of mTORC1. Of note, glutamine removal and replenishment is necessary and sufficient to induce ciliary elongation or retraction, respectively, under nutrient stress conditions both in vivo and in vitro by restoring mitochondrial anaplerosis via ASNS-dependent glutamate generation. Ift88-mutant cells lacking cilia show reduced glutamine-dependent mitochondrial anaplerosis during metabolic stress, due to reduced expression and activity of ASNS at the base of cilia. Our data indicate a role for cilia in responding to, and possibly sensing, cellular glutamine levels via ASNS during metabolic stress.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00754-6"
"natmetab","Temporal segregation of biosynthetic processes is responsible for metabolic oscillations during the budding yeast cell cycle","Many cell biological and biochemical mechanisms controlling the fundamental process of eukaryotic cell division have been identified; however, the temporal dynamics of biosynthetic processes during the cell division cycle are still elusive. Here, we show that key biosynthetic processes are temporally segregated along the cell cycle. Using budding yeast as a model and single-cell methods to dynamically measure metabolic activity, we observe two peaks in protein synthesis, in the G1 and S/G2/M phase, whereas lipid and polysaccharide synthesis peaks only once, during the S/G2/M phase. Integrating the inferred biosynthetic rates into a thermodynamic-stoichiometric metabolic model, we find that this temporal segregation in biosynthetic processes causes flux changes in primary metabolism, with an acceleration of glucose-uptake flux in G1 and phase-shifted oscillations of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchanges. Through experimental validation of the model predictions, we demonstrate that primary metabolism oscillates with cell-cycle periodicity to satisfy the changing demands of biosynthetic processes exhibiting unexpected dynamics during the cell cycle.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00741-x"

"natmetab","Extracellular acidosis restricts one-carbon metabolism and preserves T cell stemness","The accumulation of acidic metabolic waste products within the tumor microenvironment inhibits effector functions of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). However, it remains unclear how an acidic environment affects T cell metabolism and differentiation. Here we show that prolonged exposure to acid reprograms T cell intracellular metabolism and mitochondrial fitness and preserves T cell stemness. Mechanistically, elevated extracellular acidosis impairs methionine uptake and metabolism via downregulation of SLC7A5, therefore altering H3K27me3 deposition at the promoters of key T cell stemness genes. These changes promote the maintenance of a ‘stem-like memory’ state and improve long-term in vivo persistence and anti-tumor efficacy in mice. Our findings not only reveal an unexpected capacity of extracellular acidosis to maintain the stem-like properties of T cells, but also advance our understanding of how methionine metabolism affects T cell stemness.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00730-6"
"natmetab","A phenome-wide comparative analysis of genetic discordance between obesity and type 2 diabetes","Obesity and type 2 diabetes are causally related, yet there is considerable heterogeneity in the consequences of both conditions and the mechanisms of action are poorly defined. Here we show a genetic-driven approach defining two obesity profiles that convey highly concordant and discordant diabetogenic effects. We annotate and then compare association signals for these profiles across clinical and molecular phenotypic layers. Key differences are identified in a wide range of traits, including cardiovascular mortality, fat distribution, liver metabolism, blood pressure, specific lipid fractions and blood levels of proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodelling. We find marginal differences in abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes bacteria in the gut. Instrumental analyses reveal prominent causal roles for waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure and cholesterol content of high-density lipoprotein particles in the development of diabetes in obesity. We prioritize 17 genes from the discordant signature that convey protection against type 2 diabetes in obesity, which may represent logical targets for precision medicine approaches.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00731-5"
"natmetab","Integrated multi-omics reveals anaplerotic rewiring in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency","Methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) is an inborn error of metabolism with multiple monogenic causes and a poorly understood pathogenesis, leading to the absence of effective causal treatments. Here we employ multi-layered omics profiling combined with biochemical and clinical features of individuals with MMA to reveal a molecular diagnosis for 177 out of 210 (84%) cases, the majority (148) of whom display pathogenic variants in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT). Stratification of these data layers by disease severity shows dysregulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and its replenishment (anaplerosis) by glutamine. The relevance of these disturbances is evidenced by multi-organ metabolomics of a hemizygous Mmut mouse model as well as through identification of physical interactions between MMUT and glutamine anaplerotic enzymes. Using stable-isotope tracing, we find that treatment with dimethyl-oxoglutarate restores deficient tricarboxylic acid cycling. Our work highlights glutamine anaplerosis as a potential therapeutic intervention point in MMA.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00720-8"
"natmetab","TREM2hi resident macrophages protect the septic heart by maintaining cardiomyocyte homeostasis","Sepsis-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM) is common in septic patients with a high mortality and is characterized by an abnormal immune response. Owing to cellular heterogeneity, understanding the roles of immune cell subsets in SICM has been challenging. Here we identify a unique subpopulation of cardiac-resident macrophages termed CD163+RETNLA+ (Mac1), which undergoes self-renewal during sepsis and can be targeted to prevent SICM. By combining single-cell RNA sequencing with fate mapping in a mouse model of sepsis, we demonstrate that the Mac1 subpopulation has distinct transcriptomic signatures enriched in endocytosis and displays high expression of TREM2 (TREM2hi). TREM2hi Mac1 cells actively scavenge cardiomyocyte-ejected dysfunctional mitochondria. Trem2 deficiency in macrophages impairs the self-renewal capability of the Mac1 subpopulation and consequently results in defective elimination of damaged mitochondria, excessive inflammatory response in cardiac tissue, exacerbated cardiac dysfunction and decreased survival. Notably, intrapericardial administration of TREM2hi Mac1 cells prevents SICM. Our findings suggest that the modulation of TREM2hi Mac1 cells could serve as a therapeutic strategy for SICM.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00715-5"

"natmetab","Liver RBFOX2 regulates cholesterol homeostasis via Scarb1 alternative splicing in mice","RNA alternative splicing (AS) expands the regulatory potential of eukaryotic genomes. The mechanisms regulating liver-specific AS profiles and their contribution to liver function are poorly understood. Here, we identify a key role for the splicing factor RNA-binding Fox protein 2 (RBFOX2) in maintaining cholesterol homeostasis in a lipogenic environment in the liver. Using enhanced individual-nucleotide-resolution ultra-violet cross-linking and immunoprecipitation, we identify physiologically relevant targets of RBFOX2 in mouse liver, including the scavenger receptor class B type I (Scarb1). RBFOX2 function is decreased in the liver in diet-induced obesity, causing a Scarb1 isoform switch and alteration of hepatocyte lipid homeostasis. Our findings demonstrate that specific AS programmes actively maintain liver physiology, and underlie the lipotoxic effects of obesogenic diets when dysregulated. Splice-switching oligonucleotides targeting this network alleviate obesity-induced inflammation in the liver and promote an anti-atherogenic lipoprotein profile in the blood, underscoring the potential of isoform-specific RNA therapeutics for treating metabolism-associated diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00681-y"

The mutation places ASIP under control of the ubiquitously active itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase promoter, driving the generation of ASIP in patient-derived native and induced pluripotent stem cells for all germ layers and hypothalamic-like neurons. The patient’s phenotype of early-onset obesity, overgrowth, red hair and hyperinsulinemia is concordant with that of mutant mice ubiquitously expressing the homolog nonagouti. ASIP represses melanocyte-stimulating hormone-mediated activation as a melanocortin receptor antagonist, which might affect eating behavior, energy expenditure, adipocyte differentiation and pigmentation, as observed in the index patient. As the type of mutation escapes standard genetic screening algorithms, we rescreened the Leipzig Childhood Obesity cohort of 1,745 patients and identified four additional patients with the identical mutation, ectopic ASIP expression and a similar phenotype. Taken together, our data indicate that ubiquitous ectopic ASIP expression is likely a monogenic cause of human obesity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00703-9"
"natmetab","COVID-19 instigates adipose browning and atrophy through VEGF in small mammals","Patients with COVID-19 frequently manifest adipose atrophy, weight loss and cachexia, which significantly contribute to poor quality of life and mortality1,2. Browning of white adipose tissue and activation of brown adipose tissue are effective processes for energy expenditure3,4,5,6,7; however, mechanistic and functional links between SARS-CoV-2 infection and adipose thermogenesis have not been studied. In this study, we provide experimental evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection augments adipose browning and non-shivering thermogenesis (NST), which contributes to adipose atrophy and body weight loss. In mouse and hamster models, SARS-CoV-2 infection activates brown adipose tissue and instigates a browning or beige phenotype of white adipose tissues, including augmented NST. This browning phenotype was also observed in post-mortem adipose tissue of four patients who died of COVID-19. Mechanistically, high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the adipose tissue induces adipose browning through vasculature–adipocyte interaction. Inhibition of VEGF blocks COVID-19-induced adipose tissue browning and NST and partially prevents infection-induced body weight loss. Our data suggest that the browning of adipose tissues induced by COVID-19 can contribute to adipose tissue atrophy and weight loss observed during infection. Inhibition of VEGF signaling may represent an effective approach for preventing and treating COVID-19-associated weight loss.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00697-4"
"natmetab","Mitochondrial RNA stimulates beige adipocyte development in young mice","Childhood obesity is a serious public health crisis and a critical factor that determines future obesity prevalence. Signals affecting adipocyte development in early postnatal life have a strong potential to trigger childhood obesity; however, these signals are still poorly understood. We show here that mitochondrial (mt)RNA efflux stimulates transcription of nuclear-encoded genes for mitobiogenesis and thermogenesis in adipocytes of young mice and human infants. While cytosolic mtRNA is a potential trigger of the interferon (IFN) response, young adipocytes lack such a response to cytosolic mtRNA due to the suppression of IFN regulatory factor (IRF)7 expression by vitamin D receptor signalling. Adult and obese adipocytes, however, strongly express IRF7 and mount an IFN response to cytosolic mtRNA. In turn, suppressing IRF7 expression in adult adipocytes restores mtRNA-induced mitobiogenesis and thermogenesis and eventually mitigates obesity. Retrograde mitochondrion-to-nucleus signalling by mtRNA is thus a mechanism to evoke thermogenic potential during early adipocyte development and to protect against obesity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00683-w"
"natmetab","Pharmacological targeting of glutamatergic neurons within the brainstem for weight reduction","Food intake and body weight are tightly regulated by neurons within specific brain regions, including the brainstem, where acute activation of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) glutamatergic neurons expressing the glutamate transporter Vglut3 (DRNVglut3) drive a robust suppression of food intake and enhance locomotion. Activating Vglut3 neurons in DRN suppresses food intake and increases locomotion, suggesting that modulating the activity of these neurons might alter body weight. Here, we show that DRNVglut3 neurons project to the lateral hypothalamus (LHA), a canonical feeding center that also reduces food intake. Moreover, chronic DRNVglut3 activation reduces weight in both leptin-deficient (ob/ob) and leptin-resistant diet-induced obese (DIO) male mice. Molecular profiling revealed that the orexin 1 receptor (Hcrtr1) is highly enriched in DRN Vglut3 neurons, with limited expression elsewhere in the brain. Finally, an orally bioavailable, highly selective Hcrtr1 antagonist (CVN45502) significantly reduces feeding and body weight in DIO. Hcrtr1 is also co-expressed with Vglut3 in the human DRN, suggesting that there might be a similar effect in human. These results identify a potential therapy for obesity by targeting DRNVglut3 neurons while also establishing a general strategy for developing drugs for central nervous system disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00677-8"
"natmetab","Single-cell profiling of vascular endothelial cells reveals progressive organ-specific vulnerabilities during obesity","Obesity promotes diverse pathologies, including atherosclerosis and dementia, which frequently involve vascular defects and endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction. Each organ has distinct EC subtypes, but whether ECs are differentially affected by obesity is unknown. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze transcriptomes of ~375,000 ECs from seven organs in male mice at progressive stages of obesity to identify organ-specific vulnerabilities. We find that obesity deregulates gene expression networks, including lipid handling, metabolic pathways and AP1 transcription factor and inflammatory signaling, in an organ- and EC-subtype-specific manner. The transcriptomic aberrations worsen with sustained obesity and are only partially mitigated by dietary intervention and weight loss. For example, dietary intervention substantially attenuates dysregulation of liver, but not kidney, EC transcriptomes. Through integration with human genome-wide association study data, we further identify a subset of vascular disease risk genes that are induced by obesity. Our work catalogs the impact of obesity on the endothelium, constitutes a useful resource and reveals leads for investigation as potential therapeutic targets.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00674-x"
"natmetab","Brown adipose tissue-derived Nrg4 alleviates endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis in male mice","Brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity contributes to cardiovascular health by its energy-dissipating capacity but how BAT modulates vascular function and atherosclerosis through endocrine mechanisms remains poorly understood. Here we show that BAT-derived neuregulin-4 (Nrg4) ameliorates atherosclerosis in mice. BAT-specific Nrg4 deficiency accelerates vascular inflammation and adhesion responses, endothelial dysfunction and apoptosis and atherosclerosis in male mice. BAT-specific Nrg4 restoration alleviates vascular inflammation and adhesion responses, attenuates leukocyte homing and reduces endothelial injury and atherosclerosis in male mice. In endothelial cells, Nrg4 decreases apoptosis, inflammation and adhesion responses induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein. Mechanistically, protein kinase B (Akt)–nuclear factor-κB signaling is involved in the beneficial effects of Nrg4 on the endothelium. Taken together, the results reveal Nrg4 as a potential cross-talk factor between BAT and arteries that may serve as a target for atherosclerosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00671-0"
"natmetab","ADRA1A–Gαq signalling potentiates adipocyte thermogenesis through CKB and TNAP","Noradrenaline (NA) regulates cold-stimulated adipocyte thermogenesis1. Aside from cAMP signalling downstream of β-adrenergic receptor activation, how NA promotes thermogenic output is still not fully understood. Here, we show that coordinated α1-adrenergic receptor (AR) and β3-AR signalling induces the expression of thermogenic genes of the futile creatine cycle2,3, and that early B cell factors, oestrogen-related receptors and PGC1α are required for this response in vivo. NA triggers physical and functional coupling between the α1-AR subtype (ADRA1A) and Gαq to promote adipocyte thermogenesis in a manner that is dependent on the effector proteins of the futile creatine cycle, creatine kinase B and tissue-non-specific alkaline phosphatase. Combined Gαq and Gαs signalling selectively in adipocytes promotes a continual rise in whole-body energy expenditure, and creatine kinase B is required for this effect. Thus, the ADRA1A–Gαq–futile creatine cycle axis is a key regulator of facultative and adaptive thermogenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00667-w"
"natmetab","A gut-derived hormone suppresses sugar appetite and regulates food choice in Drosophila","Animals must adapt their dietary choices to meet their nutritional needs. How these needs are detected and translated into nutrient-specific appetites that drive food-choice behaviours is poorly understood. Here we show that enteroendocrine cells of the adult female Drosophila midgut sense nutrients and in response release neuropeptide F (NPF), which is an ortholog of mammalian neuropeptide Y-family gut-brain hormones. Gut-derived NPF acts on glucagon-like adipokinetic hormone (AKH) signalling to induce sugar satiety and increase consumption of protein-rich food, and on adipose tissue to promote storage of ingested nutrients. Suppression of NPF-mediated gut signalling leads to overconsumption of dietary sugar while simultaneously decreasing intake of protein-rich yeast. Furthermore, gut-derived NPF has a female-specific function in promoting consumption of protein-containing food in mated females. Together, our findings suggest that gut NPF-to-AKH signalling modulates specific appetites and regulates food choice to ensure homeostatic consumption of nutrients, providing insight into the hormonal mechanisms that underlie nutrient-specific hungers.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00672-z"
"natmetab","Metabolic reconfiguration enables synthetic reductive metabolism in yeast","Cell proliferation requires the integration of catabolic processes to provide energy, redox power and biosynthetic precursors. Here we show how the combination of rational design, metabolic rewiring and recombinant expression enables the establishment of a decarboxylation cycle in the yeast cytoplasm. This metabolic cycle can support growth by supplying energy and increased provision of NADPH or NADH in the cytosol, which can support the production of highly reduced chemicals such as glycerol, succinate and free fatty acids. With this approach, free fatty acid yield reached 40% of theoretical yield, which is the highest yield reported for Saccharomyces cerevisiae to our knowledge. This study reports the implementation of a synthetic decarboxylation cycle in the yeast cytosol, and its application in achieving high yields of valuable chemicals in cell factories. Our study also shows that, despite extensive regulation of catabolism in yeast, it is possible to rewire the energy metabolism, illustrating the power of biodesign.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00654-1"

Here, we present an integrated reference atlas, ‘HypoMap,’ of the murine hypothalamus, consisting of 384,925 cells, with the ability to incorporate new additional experiments. We validate HypoMap by comparing data collected from Smart-Seq+Fluidigm C1 and bulk RNA sequencing of selected neuronal cell types with different degrees of cellular heterogeneity. Finally, via HypoMap, we identify classes of neurons expressing glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (Glp1r) and prepronociceptin (Pnoc), and validate them using single-molecule in situ hybridization. Collectively, HypoMap provides a unified framework for the systematic functional annotation of murine hypothalamic cell types, and it can serve as an important platform to unravel the functional organization of hypothalamic neurocircuits and to identify druggable targets for treating metabolic disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00657-y"
"natmetab","COX7A2L genetic variants determine cardiorespiratory fitness in mice and human","Mitochondrial respiratory complexes form superassembled structures called supercomplexes. COX7A2L is a supercomplex-specific assembly factor in mammals, although its implication for supercomplex formation and cellular metabolism remains controversial. Here we identify a role for COX7A2L for mitochondrial supercomplex formation in humans. By using human cis-expression quantitative trait loci data, we highlight genetic variants in the COX7A2L gene that affect its skeletal muscle expression specifically. The most significant cis-expression quantitative trait locus is a 10-bp insertion in the COX7A2L 3′ untranslated region that increases messenger RNA stability and expression. Human myotubes harboring this insertion have more supercomplexes and increased respiration. Notably, increased COX7A2L expression in the muscle is associated with lower body fat and improved cardiorespiratory fitness in humans. Accordingly, specific reconstitution of Cox7a2l expression in C57BL/6J mice leads to higher maximal oxygen consumption, increased lean mass and increased energy expenditure. Furthermore, Cox7a2l expression in mice is induced specifically in the muscle upon exercise. These findings elucidate the genetic basis of mitochondrial supercomplex formation and function in humans and show that COX7A2L plays an important role in cardiorespiratory fitness, which could have broad therapeutic implications in reducing cardiovascular mortality.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00655-0"
"natmetab","The aldolase inhibitor aldometanib mimics glucose starvation to activate lysosomal AMPK","The activity of 5′-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is inversely correlated with the cellular availability of glucose. When glucose levels are low, the glycolytic enzyme aldolase is not bound to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) and, instead, signals to activate lysosomal AMPK. Here, we show that blocking FBP binding to aldolase with the small molecule aldometanib selectively activates the lysosomal pool of AMPK and has beneficial metabolic effects in rodents. We identify aldometanib in a screen for aldolase inhibitors and show that it prevents FBP from binding to v-ATPase-associated aldolase and activates lysosomal AMPK, thereby mimicking a cellular state of glucose starvation. In male mice, aldometanib elicits an insulin-independent glucose-lowering effect, without causing hypoglycaemia. Aldometanib also alleviates fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in obese male rodents. Moreover, aldometanib extends lifespan and healthspan in both Caenorhabditis elegans and mice. Taken together, aldometanib mimics and adopts the lysosomal AMPK activation pathway associated with glucose starvation to exert physiological roles, and might have potential as a therapeutic for metabolic disorders in humans.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00640-7"
"natmetab","HK1 from hepatic stellate cell–derived extracellular vesicles promotes progression of hepatocellular carcinoma","Extracellular vesicles play crucial roles in intercellular communication in the tumor microenvironment. Here we demonstrate that in hepatic fibrosis, TGF-β stimulates the palmitoylation of hexokinase 1 (HK1) in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which facilitates the secretion of HK1 via large extracellular vesicles in a TSG101-dependent manner. The large extracellular vesicle HK1 is hijacked by hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, leading to accelerated glycolysis and HCC progression. In HSCs, the nuclear receptor Nur77 transcriptionally activates the expression of depalmitoylase ABHD17B to inhibit HK1 palmitoylation, consequently attenuating HK1 release. However, TGF-β-activated Akt functionally represses Nur77 by inducing Nur77 phosphorylation and degradation. We identify the small molecule PDNPA that binds Nur77 to generate steric hindrance to block Akt targeting, thereby disrupting Akt-mediated Nur77 degradation and preserving Nur77 inhibition of HK1 release. Together, this study demonstrates an overlooked function of HK1 in HCC upon its release from HSCs and highlights PDNPA as a candidate compound for inhibiting HCC progression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00642-5"
"natmetab","GAB functions as a bioenergetic and signalling gatekeeper to control T cell inflammation","γ-Aminobutyrate (GAB), the biochemical form of (GABA) γ-aminobutyric acid, participates in shaping physiological processes, including the immune response. How GAB metabolism is controlled to mediate such functions remains elusive. Here we show that GAB is one of the most abundant metabolites in CD4+ T helper 17 (TH17) and induced T regulatory (iTreg) cells. GAB functions as a bioenergetic and signalling gatekeeper by reciprocally controlling pro-inflammatory TH17 cell and anti-inflammatory iTreg cell differentiation through distinct mechanisms. 4-Aminobutyrate aminotransferase (ABAT) funnels GAB into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to maximize carbon allocation in promoting TH17 cell differentiation. By contrast, the absence of ABAT activity in iTreg cells enables GAB to be exported to the extracellular environment where it acts as an autocrine signalling metabolite that promotes iTreg cell differentiation. Accordingly, ablation of ABAT activity in T cells protects against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) progression. Conversely, ablation of GABAA receptor in T cells worsens EAE. Our results suggest that the cell-autonomous control of GAB on CD4+ T cells is bimodal and consists of the sequential action of two processes, ABAT-dependent mitochondrial anaplerosis and the receptor-dependent signalling response, both of which are required for T cell-mediated inflammation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00638-1"
"natmetab","Independent phenotypic plasticity axes define distinct obesity sub-types","Studies in genetically ‘identical’ individuals indicate that as much as 50% of complex trait variation cannot be traced to genetics or to the environment. The mechanisms that generate this ‘unexplained’ phenotypic variation (UPV) remain largely unknown. Here, we identify neuronatin (NNAT) as a conserved factor that buffers against UPV. We find that Nnat deficiency in isogenic mice triggers the emergence of a bi-stable polyphenism, where littermates emerge into adulthood either ‘normal’ or ‘overgrown’. Mechanistically, this is mediated by an insulin-dependent overgrowth that arises from histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent β-cell hyperproliferation. A multi-dimensional analysis of monozygotic twin discordance reveals the existence of two patterns of human UPV, one of which (Type B) phenocopies the NNAT-buffered polyphenism identified in mice. Specifically, Type-B monozygotic co-twins exhibit coordinated increases in fat and lean mass across the body; decreased NNAT expression; increased HDAC-responsive gene signatures; and clinical outcomes linked to insulinemia. Critically, the Type-B UPV signature stratifies both childhood and adult cohorts into four metabolic states, including two phenotypically and molecularly distinct types of obesity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00629-2"

"natmetab","Analyzing cell-type-specific dynamics of metabolism in kidney repair","A common drawback of metabolic analyses of complex biological samples is the inability to consider cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the context of an organ or tissue. To overcome this limitation, we present an advanced high-spatial-resolution metabolomics approach using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) combined with isotope tracing. This method allows mapping of cell-type-specific dynamic changes in central carbon metabolism in the context of a complex heterogeneous tissue architecture, such as the kidney. Combined with multiplexed immunofluorescence staining, this method can detect metabolic changes and nutrient partitioning in targeted cell types, as demonstrated in a bilateral renal ischemia–reperfusion injury (bIRI) experimental model. Our approach enables us to identify region-specific metabolic perturbations associated with the lesion and throughout recovery, including unexpected metabolic anomalies in cells with an apparently normal phenotype in the recovery phase. These findings may be relevant to an understanding of the homeostatic capacity of the kidney microenvironment. In sum, this method allows us to achieve resolution at the single-cell level in situ and hence to interpret cell-type-specific metabolic dynamics in the context of structure and metabolism of neighboring cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00615-8"

To examine this, we performed liver biopsies and extensive characterization of 58 individuals with or without NAFLD/NASH. Here, we show that hepatic cell senescence is strongly related to NAFLD/NASH severity, and machine learning analysis identified senescence markers, the BMP4 inhibitor Gremlin 1 in liver and visceral fat, and the amount of visceral adipose tissue as strong predictors. Studies in liver cell spheroids made from human stellate and hepatocyte cells show BMP4 to be anti-senescent, anti-steatotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic, whereas Gremlin 1, which is particularly highly expressed in visceral fat in humans, is pro-senescent and antagonistic to BMP4. Both senescence and anti-senescence factors target the YAP/TAZ pathway, making this a likely regulator of senescence and its effects. We conclude that senescence is an important driver of human NAFLD/NASH and that BMP4 and Gremlin 1 are novel therapeutic targets.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00620-x"

Here we report the design and preclinical evaluation of a molecule that covalently links the PPARɑ/ɣ dual-agonist tesaglitazar to a GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) to allow for GLP-1R-dependent cellular delivery of tesaglitazar. GLP-1RA/tesaglitazar does not differ from the pharmacokinetically matched GLP-1RA in GLP-1R signalling, but shows GLP-1R-dependent PPARɣ-retinoic acid receptor heterodimerization and enhanced improvements of body weight, food intake and glucose metabolism relative to the GLP-1RA or tesaglitazar alone in obese male mice. The conjugate fails to affect body weight and glucose metabolism in GLP-1R knockout mice and shows preserved effects in obese mice at subthreshold doses for the GLP-1RA and tesaglitazar. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based proteomics identified PPAR regulated proteins in the hypothalamus that are acutely upregulated by GLP-1RA/tesaglitazar. Our data show that GLP-1RA/tesaglitazar improves glucose control with superior efficacy to the GLP-1RA or tesaglitazar alone and suggest that this conjugate might hold therapeutic value to acutely treat hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00617-6"

However, while maternal nutrition has been extensively studied, the effects of breastfeeding by the infant on the reprogramming of energy balance in childhood and throughout adulthood remain largely unknown. Here we show that delayed weaning in rat pups protects them against diet-induced obesity in adulthood, through enhanced brown adipose tissue thermogenesis and energy expenditure. In-depth metabolic phenotyping in this rat model as well as in transgenic mice reveals that the effects of prolonged suckling are mediated by increased hepatic fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) production and tanycyte-controlled access to the hypothalamus in adulthood. Specifically, FGF21 activates GABA-containing neurons expressing dopamine receptor 2 in the lateral hypothalamic area and zona incerta. Prolonged breastfeeding thus constitutes a protective mechanism against obesity by affecting long-lasting physiological changes in liver-to-hypothalamus communication and hypothalamic metabolic regulation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00602-z"

Yet, how these two organelle systems communicate is largely unknown. Here we identify the lysosomal biogenesis factor transcription factor EB (TFEB) as regulator for phago-lysosome-mitochondria crosstalk in macrophages. By combining cellular imaging and metabolic profiling, we find that TFEB activation, in response to bacterial stimuli, promotes the transcription of aconitate decarboxylase (Acod1, Irg1) and synthesis of its product itaconate, a mitochondrial metabolite with antimicrobial activity. Activation of the TFEB–Irg1–itaconate signalling axis reduces the survival of the intravacuolar pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. TFEB-driven itaconate is subsequently transferred via the Irg1-Rab32–BLOC3 system into the Salmonella-containing vacuole, thereby exposing the pathogen to elevated itaconate levels. By activating itaconate production, TFEB selectively restricts proliferating Salmonella, a bacterial subpopulation that normally escapes macrophage control, which contrasts TFEB’s role in autophagy-mediated pathogen degradation. Together, our data define a TFEB-driven metabolic pathway between phago-lysosomes and mitochondria that restrains Salmonella Typhimurium burden in macrophages in vitro and in vivo.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00605-w"

Whether males and females react differently to environmental cues, such as solar ultraviolet (UV) exposure, is unknown. Here we show that solar exposure induces food-seeking behavior, food intake, and food-seeking behavior and food intake in men, but not in women, through epidemiological evidence of approximately 3,000 individuals throughout the year. In mice, UVB exposure leads to increased food-seeking behavior, food intake and weight gain, with a sexual dimorphism towards males. In both mice and human males, increased appetite is correlated with elevated levels of circulating ghrelin. Specifically, UVB irradiation leads to p53 transcriptional activation of ghrelin in skin adipocytes, while a conditional p53-knockout in mice abolishes UVB-induced ghrelin expression and food-seeking behavior. In females, estrogen interferes with the p53–chromatin interaction on the ghrelin promoter, thus blocking ghrelin and food-seeking behavior in response to UVB exposure. These results identify the skin as a major mediator of energy homeostasis and may lead to therapeutic opportunities for sex-based treatments of endocrine-related diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00587-9"

PYCR1 is a key enzyme for proline synthesis and highly expressed in the stroma of breast cancer patients and in CAFs. Reducing PYCR1 levels in CAFs is sufficient to reduce tumour collagen production, tumour growth and metastatic spread in vivo and cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Both collagen and glutamine-derived proline synthesis in CAFs are epigenetically upregulated by increased pyruvate dehydrogenase-derived acetyl-CoA levels. PYCR1 is a cancer cell vulnerability and potential target for therapy; therefore, our work provides evidence that targeting PYCR1 may have the additional benefit of halting the production of a pro-tumorigenic extracellular matrix.

How mitochondria sense oxygen levels remains unknown. Here we show an oxygen-sensitive regulation of TFAM, an activator of mitochondrial transcription and replication, whose alteration is linked to tumours arising in the von Hippel–Lindau syndrome. TFAM is hydroxylated by EGLN3 and subsequently bound by the von Hippel–Lindau tumour-suppressor protein, which stabilizes TFAM by preventing mitochondrial proteolysis. Cells lacking wild-type VHL or in which EGLN3 is inactivated have reduced mitochondrial mass. Tumorigenic VHL variants leading to different clinical manifestations fail to bind hydroxylated TFAM. In contrast, cells harbouring the Chuvash polycythaemia VHLR200W mutation, involved in hypoxia-sensing disorders without tumour development, are capable of binding hydroxylated TFAM. Accordingly, VHL-related tumours, such as pheochromocytoma and renal cell carcinoma cells, display low mitochondrial content, suggesting that impaired mitochondrial biogenesis is linked to VHL tumorigenesis. Finally, inhibiting proteolysis by targeting LONP1 increases mitochondrial content in VHL-deficient cells and sensitizes therapy-resistant tumours to sorafenib treatment. Our results offer pharmacological avenues to sensitize therapy-resistant VHL tumours by focusing on the mitochondria.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00593-x"

However, ECs rely on sufficient metabolic resources to support growth and proliferation. How endothelial nutrient acquisition and usage are regulated is unknown. Here we show that these processes are instructed by Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP)/WW domain-containing transcription regulator 1 (WWTR1/TAZ)-transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD): a transcriptional module whose function is highly responsive to changes in the tissue environment. ECs lacking YAP/TAZ or their transcriptional partners, TEAD1, 2 and 4 fail to divide, resulting in stunted vascular growth in mice. Conversely, activation of TAZ, the more abundant paralogue in ECs, boosts proliferation, leading to vascular hyperplasia. We find that YAP/TAZ promote angiogenesis by fuelling nutrient-dependent mTORC1 signalling. By orchestrating the transcription of a repertoire of cell-surface transporters, including the large neutral amino acid transporter SLC7A5, YAP/TAZ-TEAD stimulate the import of amino acids and other essential nutrients, thereby enabling mTORC1 activation. Dissociating mTORC1 from these nutrient inputs—elicited by the loss of Rag GTPases—inhibits mTORC1 activity and prevents YAP/TAZ-dependent vascular growth. Together, these findings define a pivotal role for YAP/TAZ-TEAD in controlling endothelial mTORC1 and illustrate the essentiality of coordinated nutrient fluxes in the vasculature.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00584-y"

Here, we show that itaconate is partially converted to mesaconate intracellularly and that mesaconate accumulation in macrophage activation depends on prior itaconate synthesis. When added to human cells in supraphysiological concentrations, all three isomers reduce lactate levels, whereas itaconate is the strongest succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) inhibitor. In cells infected with influenza A virus (IAV), all three isomers profoundly alter amino acid metabolism, modulate cytokine/chemokine release and reduce interferon signalling, oxidative stress and the release of viral particles. Of the three isomers, citraconate is the strongest electrophile and nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) agonist. Only citraconate inhibits catalysis of itaconate by cis-aconitate decarboxylase (ACOD1), probably by competitive binding to the substrate-binding site. These results reveal mesaconate and citraconate as immunomodulatory, anti-oxidative and antiviral compounds, and citraconate as the first naturally occurring ACOD1 inhibitor.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00577-x"

Here we show that formate, a metabolite produced by the CRC-associated bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum, promotes CRC development. We describe molecular signatures linking CRC phenotypes with Fusobacterium abundance. Cocultures of F. nucleatum with patient-derived CRC cells display protumorigenic effects, along with a metabolic shift towards increased formate secretion and cancer glutamine metabolism. We further show that microbiome-derived formate drives CRC tumour invasion by triggering AhR signalling, while increasing cancer stemness. Finally, F. nucleatum or formate treatment in mice leads to increased tumour incidence or size, and Th17 cell expansion, which can favour proinflammatory profiles. Moving beyond observational studies, we identify formate as a gut-derived oncometabolite that is relevant for CRC progression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00558-0"
"natmetab","Molecular consequences of SARS-CoV-2 liver tropism","Extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have gained attention due to their links to clinical outcomes and their potential long-term sequelae1. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) displays tropism towards several organs, including the heart and kidney. Whether it also directly affects the liver has been debated2,3. Here we provide clinical, histopathological, molecular and bioinformatic evidence for the hepatic tropism of SARS-CoV-2. We find that liver injury, indicated by a high frequency of abnormal liver function tests, is a common clinical feature of COVID-19 in two independent cohorts of patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. Using autopsy samples obtained from a third patient cohort, we provide multiple levels of evidence for SARS-CoV-2 liver tropism, including viral RNA detection in 69% of autopsy liver specimens, and successful isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 from liver tissue postmortem. Furthermore, we identify transcription-, proteomic- and transcription factor-based activity profiles in hepatic autopsy samples, revealing similarities to the signatures associated with multiple other viral infections of the human liver. Together, we provide a comprehensive multimodal analysis of SARS-CoV-2 liver tropism, which increases our understanding of the molecular consequences of severe COVID-19 and could be useful for the identification of organ-specific pharmacological targets.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00552-6"
"natmetab","Switching to the cyclic pentose phosphate pathway powers the oxidative burst in activated neutrophils","Neutrophils are cells at the frontline of innate immunity that can quickly activate effector functions to eliminate pathogens upon stimulation. However, little is known about the metabolic adaptations that power these functions. Here we show rapid metabolic alterations in neutrophils upon activation, particularly drastic reconfiguration around the pentose phosphate pathway, which is specifically and quantitatively coupled to an oxidative burst. During this oxidative burst, neutrophils switch from glycolysis-dominant metabolism to a unique metabolic mode termed ‘pentose cycle’, where all glucose-6-phosphate is diverted into oxidative pentose phosphate pathway and net flux through upper glycolysis is reversed to allow substantial recycling of pentose phosphates. This reconfiguration maximizes NADPH yield to fuel superoxide production via NADPH oxidase. Disruptions of pentose cycle greatly suppress oxidative burst, the release of neutrophil extracellular traps and pathogen killing by neutrophils. Together, these results demonstrate the remarkable metabolic flexibility of neutrophils, which is essential for their functions as the first responders in innate immunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00550-8"
"natmetab","Glia fuel neurons with locally synthesized ketone bodies to sustain memory under starvation","During starvation, mammalian brains can adapt their metabolism, switching from glucose to alternative peripheral fuel sources. In the Drosophila starved brain, memory formation is subject to adaptative plasticity, but whether this adaptive plasticity relies on metabolic adaptation remains unclear. Here we show that during starvation, neurons of the fly olfactory memory centre import and use ketone bodies (KBs) as an energy substrate to sustain aversive memory formation. We identify local providers within the brain, the cortex glia, that use their own lipid store to synthesize KBs before exporting them to neurons via monocarboxylate transporters. Finally, we show that the master energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase regulates both lipid mobilization and KB export in cortex glia. Our data provide a general schema of the metabolic interactions within the brain to support memory when glucose is scarce.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00528-6"
"natmetab","Impaired phosphocreatine metabolism in white adipocytes promotes inflammation","The mechanisms promoting disturbed white adipocyte function in obesity remain largely unclear. Herein, we integrate white adipose tissue (WAT) metabolomic and transcriptomic data from clinical cohorts and find that the WAT phosphocreatine/creatine ratio is increased and creatine kinase-B expression and activity is decreased in the obese state. In human in vitro and murine in vivo models, we demonstrate that decreased phosphocreatine metabolism in white adipocytes alters adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activity via effects on adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate levels, independently of WAT beigeing. This disturbance promotes a pro-inflammatory profile characterized, in part, by increased chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) production. These data suggest that the phosphocreatine/creatine system links cellular energy shuttling with pro-inflammatory responses in human and murine white adipocytes. Our findings provide unexpected perspectives on the mechanisms driving WAT inflammation in obesity and may present avenues to target adipocyte dysfunction.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-022-00525-9"
"natmetab","PSD3 downregulation confers protection against fatty liver disease","Fatty liver disease (FLD) is a growing health issue with burdening unmet clinical needs. FLD has a genetic component but, despite the common variants already identified, there is still a missing heritability component. Using a candidate gene approach, we identify a locus (rs71519934) at the Pleckstrin and Sec7 domain-containing 3 (PSD3) gene resulting in a leucine to threonine substitution at position 186 of the protein (L186T) that reduces susceptibility to the entire spectrum of FLD in individuals at risk. PSD3 downregulation by short interfering RNA reduces intracellular lipid content in primary human hepatocytes cultured in two and three dimensions, and in human and rodent hepatoma cells. Consistent with this, Psd3 downregulation by antisense oligonucleotides in vivo protects against FLD in mice fed a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-inducing diet. Thus, translating these results to humans, PSD3 downregulation might be a future therapeutic option for treating FLD.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00518-0"
"natmetab","Identification of a regulatory pathway inhibiting adipogenesis via RSPO2","Healthy adipose tissue remodeling depends on the balance between de novo adipogenesis from adipogenic progenitor cells and the hypertrophy of adipocytes. De novo adipogenesis has been shown to promote healthy adipose tissue expansion, which confers protection from obesity-associated insulin resistance. Here, we define the role and trajectory of different adipogenic precursor subpopulations and further delineate the mechanism and cellular trajectory of adipogenesis, using single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets of murine adipogenic precursors. We identify Rspo2 as a functional regulator of adipogenesis, which is secreted by a subset of CD142+ cells to inhibit maturation of early progenitors through the receptor Lgr4. Increased circulating RSPO2 in mice leads to adipose tissue hypertrophy and insulin resistance and increased RSPO2 levels in male obese individuals correlate with impaired glucose homeostasis. Taken together, these findings identify a complex cellular crosstalk that inhibits adipogenesis and impairs adipose tissue homeostasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00509-1"
"natmetab","Oxidative ornithine metabolism supports non-inflammatory C. difficile colonization","The enteric pathogen Clostridioides difficile (Cd) is responsible for a toxin-mediated infection that causes more than 200,000 recorded hospitalizations and 13,000 deaths in the United States every year1. However, Cd can colonize the gut in the absence of disease symptoms. Prevalence of asymptomatic colonization by toxigenic Cd in healthy populations is high; asymptomatic carriers are at increased risk of infection compared to noncolonized individuals and may be a reservoir for transmission of Cd infection2,3. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms by which Cd persists in the absence of disease is necessary for understanding pathogenesis and developing refined therapeutic strategies. Here, we show with gut microbiome metatranscriptomic analysis that mice recalcitrant to Cd infection and inflammation exhibit increased community-wide expression of arginine and ornithine metabolic pathways. To query Cd metabolism specifically, we leverage RNA sequencing in gnotobiotic mice infected with two wild-type strains (630 and R20291) and isogenic toxin-deficient mutants of these strains to differentiate inflammation-dependent versus -independent transcriptional states. A single operon encoding oxidative ornithine degradation is consistently upregulated across non-toxigenic Cd strains. Combining untargeted and targeted metabolomics with bacterial and host genetics, we demonstrate that both diet- and host-derived sources of ornithine provide a competitive advantage to Cd, suggesting a mechanism for Cd persistence within a non-inflammatory, healthy gut.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00506-4"
"natmetab","Insulin signalling in tanycytes gates hypothalamic insulin uptake and regulation of AgRP neuron activity","Insulin acts on neurons and glial cells to regulate systemic glucose metabolism and feeding. However, the mechanisms of insulin access in discrete brain regions are incompletely defined. Here we show that insulin receptors in tanycytes, but not in brain endothelial cells, are required to regulate insulin access to the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. Mice lacking insulin receptors in tanycytes (IR∆Tan mice) exhibit systemic insulin resistance, while displaying normal food intake and energy expenditure. Tanycytic insulin receptors are also necessary for the orexigenic effects of ghrelin, but not for the anorexic effects of leptin. IR∆Tan mice exhibit increased agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neuronal activity, while displaying blunted AgRP neuronal adaptations to feeding-related stimuli. Lastly, a highly palatable food decreases tanycytic and arcuate nucleus insulin signalling to levels comparable to those seen in IR∆Tan mice. These changes are rooted in modifications of cellular stress responses and of mitochondrial protein quality control in tanycytes. Conclusively, we reveal a critical role of tanycyte insulin receptors in gating feeding-state-dependent regulation of AgRP neurons and systemic insulin sensitivity, and show that insulin resistance in tanycytes contributes to the pleiotropic manifestations of obesity-associated insulin resistance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00499-0"
"natmetab","NADH inhibition of SIRT1 links energy state to transcription during time-restricted feeding","In mammals, circadian rhythms are entrained to the light cycle and drive daily oscillations in levels of NAD+, a cosubstrate of the class III histone deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) that associates with clock transcription factors. Although NAD+ also participates in redox reactions, the extent to which NAD(H) couples nutrient state with circadian transcriptional cycles remains unknown. Here we show that nocturnal animals subjected to time-restricted feeding of a calorie-restricted diet (TRF-CR) only during night-time display reduced body temperature and elevated hepatic NADH during daytime. Genetic uncoupling of nutrient state from NADH redox state through transduction of the water-forming NADH oxidase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbNOX) increases daytime body temperature and blood and liver acyl-carnitines. LbNOX expression in TRF-CR mice induces oxidative gene networks controlled by brain and muscle Arnt-like protein 1 (BMAL1) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and suppresses amino acid catabolic pathways. Enzymatic analyses reveal that NADH inhibits SIRT1 in vitro, corresponding with reduced deacetylation of SIRT1 substrates during TRF-CR in vivo. Remarkably, Sirt1 liver nullizygous animals subjected to TRF-CR display persistent hypothermia even when NADH is oxidized by LbNOX. Our findings reveal that the hepatic NADH cycle links nutrient state to whole-body energetics through the rhythmic regulation of SIRT1.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00498-1"
"natmetab","Peroxisomal β-oxidation acts as a sensor for intracellular fatty acids and regulates lipolysis","To liberate fatty acids (FAs) from intracellular stores, lipolysis is regulated by the activity of the lipases adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase and monoacylglycerol lipase. Excessive FA release as a result of uncontrolled lipolysis results in lipotoxicity, which can in turn promote the progression of metabolic disorders. However, whether cells can directly sense FAs to maintain cellular lipid homeostasis is unknown. Here we report a sensing mechanism for cellular FAs based on peroxisomal degradation of FAs and coupled with reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which in turn regulates FA release by modulating lipolysis. Changes in ROS levels are sensed by PEX2, which modulates ATGL levels through post-translational ubiquitination. We demonstrate the importance of this pathway for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease progression using genetic and pharmacological approaches to alter ROS levels in vivo, which can be utilized to increase hepatic ATGL levels and ameliorate hepatic steatosis. The discovery of this peroxisomal β-oxidation-mediated feedback mechanism, which is conserved in multiple organs, couples the functions of peroxisomes and lipid droplets and might serve as a new way to manipulate lipolysis to treat metabolic disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00489-2"
"natmetab","The flavonoid procyanidin C1 has senotherapeutic activity and increases lifespan in mice","Ageing-associated functional decline of organs and increased risk for age-related chronic pathologies is driven in part by the accumulation of senescent cells, which develop the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Here we show that procyanidin C1 (PCC1), a polyphenolic component of grape seed extract (GSE), increases the healthspan and lifespan of mice through its action on senescent cells. By screening a library of natural products, we find that GSE, and PCC1 as one of its active components, have specific effects on senescent cells. At low concentrations, PCC1 appears to inhibit SASP formation, whereas it selectively kills senescent cells at higher concentrations, possibly by promoting production of reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial dysfunction. In rodent models, PCC1 depletes senescent cells in a treatment-damaged tumour microenvironment and enhances therapeutic efficacy when co-administered with chemotherapy. Intermittent administration of PCC1 to either irradiated, senescent cell-implanted or naturally aged old mice alleviates physical dysfunction and prolongs survival. We identify PCC1 as a natural senotherapeutic agent with in vivo activity and high potential for further development as a clinical intervention to delay, alleviate or prevent age-related pathologies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00491-8"
"natmetab","Diet-induced alteration of intestinal stem cell function underlies obesity and prediabetes in mice","Excess nutrient uptake and altered hormone secretion in the gut contribute to a systemic energy imbalance, which causes obesity and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. This functional maladaptation is thought to emerge at the level of the intestinal stem cells (ISCs). However, it is not clear how an obesogenic diet affects ISC identity and fate. Here we show that an obesogenic diet induces ISC and progenitor hyperproliferation, enhances ISC differentiation and cell turnover and changes the regional identities of ISCs and enterocytes in mice. Single-cell resolution of the enteroendocrine lineage reveals an increase in progenitors and peptidergic enteroendocrine cell types and a decrease in serotonergic enteroendocrine cell types. Mechanistically, we link increased fatty acid synthesis, Ppar signaling and the Insr–Igf1r–Akt pathway to mucosal changes. This study describes molecular mechanisms of diet-induced intestinal maladaptation that promote obesity and therefore underlie the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome and associated complications.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00458-9"
"natmetab","Cellular pyrimidine imbalance triggers mitochondrial DNA–dependent innate immunity","Cytosolic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) elicits a type I interferon response, but signals triggering the release of mtDNA from mitochondria remain enigmatic. Here, we show that mtDNA-dependent immune signalling via the cyclic GMP–AMP synthase‒stimulator of interferon genes‒TANK-binding kinase 1 (cGAS–STING–TBK1) pathway is under metabolic control and is induced by cellular pyrimidine deficiency. The mitochondrial protease YME1L preserves pyrimidine pools by supporting de novo nucleotide synthesis and by proteolysis of the pyrimidine nucleotide carrier SLC25A33. Deficiency of YME1L causes inflammation in mouse retinas and in cultured cells. It drives the release of mtDNA and a cGAS–STING–TBK1-dependent inflammatory response, which requires SLC25A33 and is suppressed upon replenishment of cellular pyrimidine pools. Overexpression of SLC25A33 is sufficient to induce immune signalling by mtDNA. Similarly, depletion of cytosolic nucleotides upon inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis triggers mtDNA-dependent immune responses in wild-type cells. Our results thus identify mtDNA release and innate immune signalling as a metabolic response to cellular pyrimidine deficiencies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00385-9"
"natmetab","Inosine is an alternative carbon source for CD8+-T-cell function under glucose restriction","T cells undergo metabolic rewiring to meet their bioenergetic, biosynthetic and redox demands following antigen stimulation. To fulfil these needs, effector T cells must adapt to fluctuations in environmental nutrient levels at sites of infection and inflammation. Here, we show that effector T cells can utilize inosine, as an alternative substrate, to support cell growth and function in the absence of glucose in vitro. T cells metabolize inosine into hypoxanthine and phosphorylated ribose by purine nucleoside phosphorylase. We demonstrate that the ribose subunit of inosine can enter into central metabolic pathways to provide ATP and biosynthetic precursors, and that cancer cells display diverse capacities to utilize inosine as a carbon source. Moreover, the supplementation with inosine enhances the anti-tumour efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade and adoptive T-cell transfer in solid tumours that are defective in metabolizing inosine, reflecting the capability of inosine to relieve tumour-imposed metabolic restrictions on T cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-020-0219-4"
