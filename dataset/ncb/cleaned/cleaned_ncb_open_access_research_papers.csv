"ncb","A placental model of SARS-CoV-2 infection reveals ACE2-dependent susceptibility and differentiation impairment in syncytiotrophoblasts","SARS-CoV-2 infection causes COVID-19. Several clinical reports have linked COVID-19 during pregnancy to negative birth outcomes and placentitis. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning SARS-CoV-2 infection during placentation and early pregnancy are not clear. Here, to shed light on this, we used induced trophoblast stem cells to generate an in vitro early placenta infection model. We identified that syncytiotrophoblasts could be infected through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Using a co-culture model of vertical transmission, we confirmed the ability of the virus to infect syncytiotrophoblasts through a previous endometrial cell infection. We further demonstrated transcriptional changes in infected syncytiotrophoblasts that led to impairment of cellular processes, reduced secretion of HCG hormone and morphological changes vital for syncytiotrophoblast function. Furthermore, different antibody strategies and antiviral drugs restore these impairments. In summary, we have established a scalable and tractable platform to study early placental cell types and highlighted its use in studying strategies to protect the placenta.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01182-0"
"ncb","The Troyer syndrome protein spartin mediates selective autophagy of lipid droplets","Lipid droplets (LDs) are crucial organelles for energy storage and lipid homeostasis. Autophagy of LDs is an important pathway for their catabolism, but the molecular mechanisms mediating LD degradation by selective autophagy (lipophagy) are unknown. Here we identify spartin as a receptor localizing to LDs and interacting with core autophagy machinery, and we show that spartin is required to deliver LDs to lysosomes for triglyceride mobilization. Mutations in SPART (encoding spartin) lead to Troyer syndrome, a form of complex hereditary spastic paraplegia1. Interfering with spartin function in cultured human neurons or murine brain neurons leads to LD and triglyceride accumulation. Our identification of spartin as a lipophagy receptor, thus, suggests that impaired LD turnover contributes to Troyer syndrome development.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01178-w"
"ncb","Class 3 PI3K coactivates the circadian clock to promote rhythmic de novo purine synthesis","Metabolic demands fluctuate rhythmically and rely on coordination between the circadian clock and nutrient-sensing signalling pathways, yet mechanisms of their interaction remain not fully understood. Surprisingly, we find that class 3 phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), known best for its essential role as a lipid kinase in endocytosis and lysosomal degradation by autophagy, has an overlooked nuclear function in gene transcription as a coactivator of the heterodimeric transcription factor and circadian driver Bmal1-Clock. Canonical pro-catabolic functions of class 3 PI3K in trafficking rely on the indispensable complex between the lipid kinase Vps34 and regulatory subunit Vps15. We demonstrate that although both subunits of class 3 PI3K interact with RNA polymerase II and co-localize with active transcription sites, exclusive loss of Vps15 in cells blunts the transcriptional activity of Bmal1-Clock. Thus, we establish non-redundancy between nuclear Vps34 and Vps15, reflected by the persistent nuclear pool of Vps15 in Vps34-depleted cells and the ability of Vps15 to coactivate Bmal1-Clock independently of its complex with Vps34. In physiology we find that Vps15 is required for metabolic rhythmicity in liver and, unexpectedly, it promotes pro-anabolic de novo purine nucleotide synthesis. We show that Vps15 activates the transcription of Ppat, a key enzyme for the production of inosine monophosphate, a central metabolic intermediate for purine synthesis. Finally, we demonstrate that in fasting, which represses clock transcriptional activity, Vps15 levels are decreased on the promoters of Bmal1 targets, Nr1d1 and Ppat. Our findings open avenues for establishing the complexity for nuclear class 3 PI3K signalling for temporal regulation of energy homeostasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01171-3"
"ncb","Dynamic de novo heterochromatin assembly and disassembly at replication forks ensures fork stability","Chromatin is dynamically reorganized when DNA replication forks are challenged. However, the process of epigenetic reorganization and its implication for fork stability is poorly understood. Here we discover a checkpoint-regulated cascade of chromatin signalling that activates the histone methyltransferase EHMT2/G9a to catalyse heterochromatin assembly at stressed replication forks. Using biochemical and single molecule chromatin fibre approaches, we show that G9a together with SUV39h1 induces chromatin compaction by accumulating the repressive modifications, H3K9me1/me2/me3, in the vicinity of stressed replication forks. This closed conformation is also favoured by the G9a-dependent exclusion of the H3K9-demethylase JMJD1A/KDM3A, which facilitates heterochromatin disassembly upon fork restart. Untimely heterochromatin disassembly from stressed forks by KDM3A enables PRIMPOL access, triggering single-stranded DNA gap formation and sensitizing cells towards chemotherapeutic drugs. These findings may help in explaining chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis observed in patients with cancer displaying elevated levels of G9a/H3K9me3.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01167-z"
"ncb","Arf1 coordinates fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial homeostasis","Lipid mobilization through fatty acid [beta]-oxidation is a central process essential for energy production during nutrient shortage. In yeast, this catabolic process starts in the peroxisome from where [beta]-oxidation products enter mitochondria and fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Little is known about the physical and metabolic cooperation between these organelles. Here we found that expression of fatty acid transporters and of the rate-limiting enzyme involved in [beta]-oxidation is decreased in cells expressing a hyperactive mutant of the small GTPase Arf1, leading to an accumulation of fatty acids in lipid droplets. Consequently, mitochondria became fragmented and ATP synthesis decreased. Genetic and pharmacological depletion of fatty acids phenocopied the arf1 mutant mitochondrial phenotype. Although [beta]-oxidation occurs in both mitochondria and peroxisomes in mammals, Arf1's role in fatty acid metabolism is conserved. Together, our results indicate that Arf1 integrates metabolism into energy production by regulating fatty acid storage and utilization, and presumably organelle contact sites.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01180-2"
"ncb","Single-cell analysis reveals transcriptomic and epigenomic impacts on the maternal-fetal interface following SARS-CoV-2 infection","During pregnancy the maternal-fetal interface plays vital roles in fetal development. Its disruption is frequently found in pregnancy complications. Recent studies show increased incidences of adverse pregnancy outcomes in patients with COVID-19; however, the mechanism remains unclear. Here we analysed the molecular impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the maternal-fetal interface. Generating bulk and single-nucleus transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles from patients with COVID-19 and control samples, we discovered aberrant immune activation and angiogenesis patterns in distinct cells from patients. Surprisingly, retrotransposons were also dysregulated in specific cell types. Notably, reduced enhancer activities of LTR8B elements were functionally linked to the downregulation of pregnancy-specific glycoprotein genes in syncytiotrophoblasts. Our findings revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced substantial changes to the epigenome and transcriptome at the maternal-fetal interface, which may be associated with pregnancy complications.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01169-x"
"ncb","mTORC2-NDRG1-CDC42 axis couples fasting to mitochondrial fission","Fasting triggers diverse physiological adaptations including increases in circulating fatty acids and mitochondrial respiration to facilitate organismal survival. The mechanisms driving mitochondrial adaptations and respiratory sufficiency during fasting remain incompletely understood. Here we show that fasting or lipid availability stimulates mTORC2 activity. Activation of mTORC2 and phosphorylation of its downstream target NDRG1 at serine 336 sustains mitochondrial fission and respiratory sufficiency. Time-lapse imaging shows that NDRG1, but not the phosphorylation-deficient NDRG1Ser336Ala mutant, engages with mitochondria to facilitate fission in control cells, as well as in those lacking DRP1. Using proteomics, a small interfering RNA screen, and epistasis experiments, we show that mTORC2-phosphorylated NDRG1 cooperates with small GTPase CDC42 and effectors and regulators of CDC42 to orchestrate fission. Accordingly, RictorKO, NDRG1Ser336Ala mutants and Cdc42-deficient cells each display mitochondrial phenotypes reminiscent of fission failure. During nutrient surplus, mTOR complexes perform anabolic functions; however, paradoxical reactivation of mTORC2 during fasting unexpectedly drives mitochondrial fission and respiration.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01163-3"
"ncb","Lipid droplet-associated lncRNA LIPTER preserves cardiac lipid metabolism","Lipid droplets (LDs) are cellular organelles critical for lipid homeostasis, with intramyocyte LD accumulation implicated in metabolic disorder-associated heart diseases. Here we identify a human long non-coding RNA, Lipid-Droplet Transporter (LIPTER), essential for LD transport in human cardiomyocytes. LIPTER binds phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate on LD surface membranes and the MYH10 protein, connecting LDs to the MYH10-ACTIN cytoskeleton and facilitating LD transport. LIPTER and MYH10 deficiencies impair LD trafficking, mitochondrial function and survival of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Conditional Myh10 deletion in mouse cardiomyocytes leads to LD accumulation, reduced fatty acid oxidation and compromised cardiac function. We identify NKX2.5 as the primary regulator of cardiomyocyte-specific LIPTER transcription. Notably, LIPTER transgenic expression mitigates cardiac lipotoxicity, preserves cardiac function and alleviates cardiomyopathies in high-fat-diet-fed and Leprdb/db mice. Our findings unveil a molecular connector role of LIPTER in intramyocyte LD transport, crucial for lipid metabolism of the human heart, and hold significant clinical implications for treating metabolic syndrome-associated heart diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01162-4"
"ncb","Divergent metabolic programmes control two populations of MAIT cells that protect the lung","Although mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells provide rapid, innate-like responses, they are not pre-set, and memory-like responses have been described for MAIT cells following infections. The importance of metabolism for controlling these responses, however, is unknown. Here, following pulmonary immunization with a Salmonella vaccine strain, mouse MAIT cells expanded as separate CD127−Klrg1+ and CD127+Klrg1− antigen-adapted populations that differed in terms of their transcriptome, function and localization in lung tissue. These populations remained altered from steady state for months as stable, separate MAIT cell lineages with enhanced effector programmes and divergent metabolism. CD127+ MAIT cells engaged in an energetic, mitochondrial metabolic programme, which was critical for their maintenance and IL-17A synthesis. This programme was supported by high fatty acid uptake and mitochondrial oxidation and relied on highly polarized mitochondria and autophagy. After vaccination, CD127+ MAIT cells protected mice against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. In contrast, Klrg1+ MAIT cells had dormant but ready-to-respond mitochondria and depended instead on Hif1a-driven glycolysis to survive and produce IFN-[gamma]. They responded antigen independently and participated in protection from influenza virus. These metabolic dependencies may enable tuning of memory-like MAIT cell responses for vaccination and immunotherapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01152-6"

"ncb","Single-nucleus multi-omics of human stem cell-derived islets identifies deficiencies in lineage specification","Insulin-producing [beta] cells created from human pluripotent stem cells have potential as a therapy for insulin-dependent diabetes, but human pluripotent stem cell-derived islets (SC-islets) still differ from their in vivo counterparts. To better understand the state of cell types within SC-islets and identify lineage specification deficiencies, we used single-nucleus multi-omic sequencing to analyse chromatin accessibility and transcriptional profiles of SC-islets and primary human islets. Here we provide an analysis that enabled the derivation of gene lists and activity for identifying each SC-islet cell type compared with primary islets. Within SC-islets, we found that the difference between [beta] cells and awry enterochromaffin-like cells is a gradient of cell states rather than a stark difference in identity. Furthermore, transplantation of SC-islets in vivo improved cellular identities overtime, while long-term in vitro culture did not. Collectively, our results highlight the importance of chromatin and transcriptional landscapes during islet cell specification and maturation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01150-8"
"ncb","An mRNA processing pathway suppresses metastasis by governing translational control from the nucleus","Cancer cells often co-opt post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to achieve pathologic expression of gene networks that drive metastasis. Translational control is a major regulatory hub in oncogenesis; however, its effects on cancer progression remain poorly understood. Here, to address this, we used ribosome profiling to compare genome-wide translation efficiencies of poorly and highly metastatic breast cancer cells and patient-derived xenografts. We developed dedicated regression-based methods to analyse ribosome profiling and alternative polyadenylation data, and identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (HNRNPC) as a translational controller of a specific mRNA regulon. We found that HNRNPC is downregulated in highly metastatic cells, which causes HNRNPC-bound mRNAs to undergo 3' untranslated region lengthening and, subsequently, translational repression. We showed that modulating HNRNPC expression impacts the metastatic capacity of breast cancer cells in xenograft mouse models. In addition, the reduced expression of HNRNPC and its regulon is associated with the worse prognosis in breast cancer patient cohorts.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01141-9"

"ncb","SEL1L-HRD1 endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation controls STING-mediated innate immunity by limiting the size of the activable STING pool","Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) orchestrates the production of proinflammatory cytokines in response to cytosolic double-stranded DNA; however, the pathophysiological significance and molecular mechanism underlying the folding and maturation of nascent STING protein at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) remain unknown. Here we report that the SEL1L-HRD1 protein complex-the most conserved branch of ER-associated degradation (ERAD)-is a negative regulator of the STING innate immunity by ubiquitinating and targeting nascent STING protein for proteasomal degradation in the basal state. SEL1L or HRD1 deficiency in macrophages specifically amplifies STING signalling and immunity against viral infection and tumour growth. Mechanistically, nascent STING protein is a bona fide substrate of SEL1L-HRD1 in the basal state, uncoupled from ER stress or its sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1[alpha]. Hence, our study not only establishes a key role of SEL1L-HRD1 ERAD in innate immunity by limiting the size of the activable STING pool, but identifies a regulatory mechanism and therapeutic approach to targeting STING.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01138-4"
"ncb","Lipid droplets and peroxisomes are co-regulated to drive lifespan extension in response to mono-unsaturated fatty acids","Dietary mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) are linked to longevity in several species. But the mechanisms by which MUFAs extend lifespan remain unclear. Here we show that an organelle network involving lipid droplets and peroxisomes is critical for MUFA-induced longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans. MUFAs upregulate the number of lipid droplets in fat storage tissues. Increased lipid droplet number is necessary for MUFA-induced longevity and predicts remaining lifespan. Lipidomics datasets reveal that MUFAs also modify the ratio of membrane lipids and ether lipids-a signature associated with decreased lipid oxidation. In agreement with this, MUFAs decrease lipid oxidation in middle-aged individuals. Intriguingly, MUFAs upregulate not only lipid droplet number but also peroxisome number. A targeted screen identifies genes involved in the co-regulation of lipid droplets and peroxisomes, and reveals that induction of both organelles is optimal for longevity. Our study uncovers an organelle network involved in lipid homeostasis and lifespan regulation, opening new avenues for interventions to delay aging.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01136-6"
"ncb","Tissue memory relies on stem cell priming in distal undamaged areas","Epithelial cells that participated in wound repair elicit a more efficient response to future injuries, which is believed to be locally restricted. Here we show that cell adaptation resulting from a localized tissue damage has a wide spatial impact at a scale not previously appreciated. We demonstrate that a specific stem cell population, distant from the original injury, originates long-lasting wound memory progenitors residing in their own niche. Notably, these distal memory cells have not taken part in the first healing but become intrinsically pre-activated through priming. This cell state, maintained at the chromatin and transcriptional level, leads to an enhanced wound repair that is partially recapitulated through epigenetic perturbation. Importantly wound memory has long-term harmful consequences, exacerbating tumourigenesis. Overall, we show that sub-organ-scale adaptation to injury relies on spatially organized memory-dedicated progenitors, characterized by an actionable cell state that establishes an epigenetic field cancerization and predisposes to tumour onset.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01120-0"
"ncb","Dynamic antagonism between key repressive pathways maintains the placental epigenome","DNA and Histone 3 Lysine 27 methylation typically function as repressive modifications and operate within distinct genomic compartments. In mammals, the majority of the genome is kept in a DNA methylated state, whereas the Polycomb repressive complexes regulate the unmethylated CpG-rich promoters of developmental genes. In contrast to this general framework, the extra-embryonic lineages display non-canonical, globally intermediate DNA methylation levels, including disruption of local Polycomb domains. Here, to better understand this unusual landscape's molecular properties, we genetically and chemically perturbed major epigenetic pathways in mouse trophoblast stem cells. We find that the extra-embryonic epigenome reflects ongoing and dynamic de novo methyltransferase recruitment, which is continuously antagonized by Polycomb to maintain intermediate, locally disordered methylation. Despite its disorganized molecular appearance, our data point to a highly controlled equilibrium between counteracting repressors within extra-embryonic cells, one that can seemingly persist indefinitely without bistable features typically seen for embryonic forms of epigenetic regulation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01114-y"
"ncb","Metaboverse enables automated discovery and visualization of diverse metabolic regulatory patterns","Metabolism is intertwined with various cellular processes, including controlling cell fate, influencing tumorigenesis, participating in stress responses and more. Metabolism is a complex, interdependent network, and local perturbations can have indirect effects that are pervasive across the metabolic network. Current analytical and technical limitations have long created a bottleneck in metabolic data interpretation. To address these shortcomings, we developed Metaboverse, a user-friendly tool to facilitate data exploration and hypothesis generation. Here we introduce algorithms that leverage the metabolic network to extract complex reaction patterns from data. To minimize the impact of missing measurements within the network, we introduce methods that enable pattern recognition across multiple reactions. Using Metaboverse, we identify a previously undescribed metabolite signature that correlated with survival outcomes in early stage lung adenocarcinoma patients. Using a yeast model, we identify metabolic responses suggesting an adaptive role of citrate homeostasis during mitochondrial dysfunction facilitated by the citrate transporter, Ctp1. We demonstrate that Metaboverse augments the user's ability to extract meaningful patterns from multi-omics datasets to develop actionable hypotheses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01117-9"
"ncb","Co-option of epidermal cells enables touch sensing","The epidermis is equipped with specialized mechanosensory organs that enable the detection of tactile stimuli. Here, by examining the differentiation of the tactile bristles, mechanosensory organs decorating the Drosophila adult epidermis, we show that neighbouring epidermal cells are essential for touch perception. Each mechanosensory bristle signals to the surrounding epidermis to co-opt a single epidermal cell, which we named the F-Cell. Once specified, the F-Cell adopts a specialized morphology to ensheath each bristle. Functional assays reveal that adult mechanosensory bristles require association with the epidermal F-Cell for touch sensing. Our findings underscore the importance of resident epidermal cells in the assembly of functional touch-sensitive organs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01110-2"

"ncb","A multi-organoid platform identifies CIART as a key factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection","COVID-19 is a systemic disease involving multiple organs. We previously established a platform to derive organoids and cells from human pluripotent stem cells to model SARS-CoV-2 infection and perform drug screens1,2. This provided insight into cellular tropism and the host response, yet the molecular mechanisms regulating SARS-CoV-2 infection remain poorly defined. Here we systematically examined changes in transcript profiles caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection at different multiplicities of infection for lung airway organoids, lung alveolar organoids and cardiomyocytes, and identified several genes that are generally implicated in controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection, including CIART, the circadian-associated repressor of transcription. Lung airway organoids, lung alveolar organoids and cardiomyocytes derived from isogenic CIART−/− human pluripotent stem cells were significantly resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection, independently of viral entry. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis further validated the decreased levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection in ciliated-like cells of lung airway organoids. CUT&RUN, ATAC-seq and RNA-sequencing analyses showed that CIART controls SARS-CoV-2 infection at least in part through the regulation of NR4A1, a gene also identified from the multi-organoid analysis. Finally, transcriptional profiling and pharmacological inhibition led to the discovery that the Retinoid X Receptor pathway regulates SARS-CoV-2 infection downstream of CIART and NR4A1. The multi-organoid platform identified the role of circadian-clock regulation in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which provides potential therapeutic targets for protection against COVID-19 across organ systems.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01095-y"
"ncb","STING signalling is terminated through ESCRT-dependent microautophagy of vesicles originating from recycling endosomes","Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is essential for the type I interferon response against a variety of DNA pathogens. Upon emergence of cytosolic DNA, STING translocates from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi where STING activates the downstream kinase TBK1, then to lysosome through recycling endosomes (REs) for its degradation. Although the molecular machinery of STING activation is extensively studied and defined, the one underlying STING degradation and inactivation has not yet been fully elucidated. Here we show that STING is degraded by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT)-driven microautophagy. Airyscan super-resolution microscopy and correlative light/electron microscopy suggest that STING-positive vesicles of an RE origin are directly encapsulated into Lamp1-positive compartments. Screening of mammalian Vps genes, the yeast homologues of which regulate Golgi-to-vacuole transport, shows that ESCRT proteins are essential for the STING encapsulation into Lamp1-positive compartments. Knockdown of Tsg101 and Vps4, components of ESCRT, results in the accumulation of STING vesicles in the cytosol, leading to the sustained type I interferon response. Knockdown of Tsg101 in human primary T cells leads to an increase the expression of interferon-stimulated genes. STING undergoes K63-linked ubiquitination at lysine 288 during its transit through the Golgi/REs, and this ubiquitination is required for STING degradation. Our results reveal a molecular mechanism that prevents hyperactivation of innate immune signalling, which operates at REs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01098-9"
"ncb","SARS-CoV-2 infection induces DNA damage, through CHK1 degradation and impaired 53BP1 recruitment, and cellular senescence","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the RNA virus responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Although SARS-CoV-2 was reported to alter several cellular pathways, its impact on DNA integrity and the mechanisms involved remain unknown. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 causes DNA damage and elicits an altered DNA damage response. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 proteins ORF6 and NSP13 cause degradation of the DNA damage response kinase CHK1 through proteasome and autophagy, respectively. CHK1 loss leads to deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) shortage, causing impaired S-phase progression, DNA damage, pro-inflammatory pathways activation and cellular senescence. Supplementation of deoxynucleosides reduces that. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 N-protein impairs 53BP1 focal recruitment by interfering with damage-induced long non-coding RNAs, thus reducing DNA repair. Key observations are recapitulated in SARS-CoV-2-infected mice and patients with COVID-19. We propose that SARS-CoV-2, by boosting ribonucleoside triphosphate levels to promote its replication at the expense of dNTPs and by hijacking damage-induced long non-coding RNAs' biology, threatens genome integrity and causes altered DNA damage response activation, induction of inflammation and cellular senescence.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01096-x"
"ncb","A neurodevelopmental epigenetic programme mediated by SMARCD3-DAB1-Reelin signalling is hijacked to promote medulloblastoma metastasis","How abnormal neurodevelopment relates to the tumour aggressiveness of medulloblastoma (MB), the most common type of embryonal tumour, remains elusive. Here we uncover a neurodevelopmental epigenomic programme that is hijacked to induce MB metastatic dissemination. Unsupervised analyses of integrated publicly available datasets with our newly generated data reveal that SMARCD3 (also known as BAF60C) regulates Disabled 1 (DAB1)-mediated Reelin signalling in Purkinje cell migration and MB metastasis by orchestrating cis-regulatory elements at the DAB1 locus. We further identify that a core set of transcription factors, enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) and nuclear factor I X (NFIX), coordinates with the cis-regulatory elements at the SMARCD3 locus to form a chromatin hub to control SMARCD3 expression in the developing cerebellum and in metastatic MB. Increased SMARCD3 expression activates Reelin-DAB1-mediated Src kinase signalling, which results in a MB response to Src inhibition. These data deepen our understanding of how neurodevelopmental programming influences disease progression and provide a potential therapeutic option for patients with MB.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-023-01093-0"
"ncb","Polarized branched Actin modulates cortical mechanics to produce unequal-size daughters during asymmetric division","The control of cell shape during cytokinesis requires a precise regulation of mechanical properties of the cell cortex. Only few studies have addressed the mechanisms underlying the robust production of unequal-sized daughters during asymmetric cell division. Here we report that unequal daughter-cell sizes resulting from asymmetric sensory organ precursor divisions in Drosophila are controlled by the relative amount of cortical branched Actin between the two cell poles. We demonstrate this by mistargeting the machinery for branched Actin dynamics using nanobodies and optogenetics. We can thereby engineer the cell shape with temporal precision and thus the daughter-cell size at different stages of cytokinesis. Most strikingly, inverting cortical Actin asymmetry causes an inversion of daughter-cell sizes. Our findings uncover the physical mechanism by which the sensory organ precursor mother cell controls relative daughter-cell size: polarized cortical Actin modulates the cortical bending rigidity to set the cell surface curvature, stabilize the division and ultimately lead to unequal daughter-cell size.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01058-9"
"ncb","Biologically informed deep learning to query gene programs in single-cell atlases","The increasing availability of large-scale single-cell atlases has enabled the detailed description of cell states. In parallel, advances in deep learning allow rapid analysis of newly generated query datasets by mapping them into reference atlases. However, existing data transformations learned to map query data are not easily explainable using biologically known concepts such as genes or pathways. Here we propose expiMap, a biologically informed deep-learning architecture that enables single-cell reference mapping. ExpiMap learns to map cells into biologically understandable components representing known 'gene programs'. The activity of each cell for a gene program is learned while simultaneously refining them and learning de novo programs. We show that expiMap compares favourably to existing methods while bringing an additional layer of interpretability to integrative single-cell analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrate its applicability to analyse single-cell perturbation responses in different tissues and species and resolve responses of patients who have coronavirus disease 2019 to different treatments across cell types.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01072-x"
"ncb","Actin-driven chromosome clustering facilitates fast and complete chromosome capture in mammalian oocytes","Accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis is crucial for reproduction. Human and porcine oocytes transiently cluster their chromosomes before the onset of spindle assembly and subsequent chromosome segregation. The mechanism and function of chromosome clustering are unknown. Here we show that chromosome clustering is required to prevent chromosome losses in the long gap phase between nuclear envelope breakdown and the onset of spindle assembly, and to promote the rapid capture of all chromosomes by the acentrosomal spindle. The initial phase of chromosome clustering is driven by a dynamic network of Formin-2- and Spire-nucleated actin cables. The actin cables form in the disassembling nucleus and migrate towards the nuclear centre, moving the chromosomes centripetally by interacting with their arms and kinetochores as they migrate. A cage of stable microtubule loops drives the late stages of chromosome clustering. Together, our data establish a crucial role for chromosome clustering in accurate progression through meiosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01082-9"
"ncb","Expansion of ventral foregut is linked to changes in the enhancer landscape for organ-specific differentiation","Cell proliferation is fundamental for almost all stages of development and differentiation that require an increase in cell number. Although cell cycle phase has been associated with differentiation, the actual process of proliferation has not been considered as having a specific role. Here we exploit human embryonic stem cell-derived endodermal progenitors that we find are an in vitro model for the ventral foregut. These cells exhibit expansion-dependent increases in differentiation efficiency to pancreatic progenitors that are linked to organ-specific enhancer priming at the level of chromatin accessibility and the decommissioning of lineage-inappropriate enhancers. Our findings suggest that cell proliferation in embryonic development is about more than tissue expansion; it is required to ensure equilibration of gene regulatory networks allowing cells to become primed for future differentiation. Expansion of lineage-specific intermediates may therefore be an important step in achieving high-fidelity in vitro differentiation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01075-8"
"ncb","Small heat shock proteins operate as molecular chaperones in the mitochondrial intermembrane space","Mitochondria are complex organelles with different compartments, each harbouring their own protein quality control factors. While chaperones of the mitochondrial matrix are well characterized, it is poorly understood which chaperones protect the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Here we show that cytosolic small heat shock proteins are imported under basal conditions into the mitochondrial intermembrane space, where they operate as molecular chaperones. Protein misfolding in the mitochondrial intermembrane space leads to increased recruitment of small heat shock proteins. Depletion of small heat shock proteins leads to mitochondrial swelling and reduced respiration, while aggregation of aggregation-prone substrates is countered in their presence. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease-causing mutations disturb the mitochondrial function of HSPB1, potentially linking previously observed mitochondrial dysfunction in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2F to its role in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Our results reveal that small heat shock proteins form a chaperone system that operates in the mitochondrial intermembrane space.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01074-9"
"ncb","The ETS transcription factor ETV6 constrains the transcriptional activity of EWS-FLI to promote Ewing sarcoma","Transcription factors (TFs) are frequently mutated in cancer. Paediatric cancers exhibit few mutations genome-wide but frequently harbour sentinel mutations that affect TFs, which provides a context to precisely study the transcriptional circuits that support mutant TF-driven oncogenesis. A broadly relevant mechanism that has garnered intense focus involves the ability of mutant TFs to hijack wild-type lineage-specific TFs in self-reinforcing transcriptional circuits. However, it is not known whether this specific type of circuitry is equally crucial in all mutant TF-driven cancers. Here we describe an alternative yet central transcriptional mechanism that promotes Ewing sarcoma, wherein constraint, rather than reinforcement, of the activity of the fusion TF EWS-FLI supports cancer growth. We discover that ETV6 is a crucial TF dependency that is specific to this disease because it, counter-intuitively, represses the transcriptional output of EWS-FLI. This work discovers a previously undescribed transcriptional mechanism that promotes cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01059-8"
"ncb","Mitochondria regulate intracellular coenzyme Q transport and ferroptotic resistance via STARD7","Coenzyme Q (or ubiquinone) is a redox-active lipid that serves as universal electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and antioxidant in the plasma membrane limiting lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. Mechanisms allowing cellular coenzyme Q distribution after synthesis within mitochondria are not understood. Here we identify the cytosolic lipid transfer protein STARD7 as a critical factor of intracellular coenzyme Q transport and suppressor of ferroptosis. Dual localization of STARD7 to the intermembrane space of mitochondria and the cytosol upon cleavage by the rhomboid protease PARL ensures the synthesis of coenzyme Q in mitochondria and its transport to the plasma membrane. While mitochondrial STARD7 preserves coenzyme Q synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation function and cristae morphogenesis, cytosolic STARD7 is required for the transport of coenzyme Q to the plasma membrane and protects against ferroptosis. A coenzyme Q variant competes with phosphatidylcholine for binding to purified STARD7 in vitro. Overexpression of cytosolic STARD7 increases ferroptotic resistance of the cells, but limits coenzyme Q abundance in mitochondria and respiratory cell growth. Our findings thus demonstrate the need to coordinate coenzyme Q synthesis and cellular distribution by PARL-mediated STARD7 processing and identify PARL and STARD7 as promising targets to interfere with ferroptosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01071-y"
"ncb","A topographic atlas defines developmental origins of cell heterogeneity in the human embryonic lung","The lung contains numerous specialized cell types with distinct roles in tissue function and integrity. To clarify the origins and mechanisms generating cell heterogeneity, we created a comprehensive topographic atlas of early human lung development. Here we report 83 cell states and several spatially resolved developmental trajectories and predict cell interactions within defined tissue niches. We integrated single-cell RNA sequencing and spatially resolved transcriptomics into a web-based, open platform for interactive exploration. We show distinct gene expression programmes, accompanying sequential events of cell differentiation and maturation of the secretory and neuroendocrine cell types in proximal epithelium. We define the origin of airway fibroblasts associated with airway smooth muscle in bronchovascular bundles and describe a trajectory of Schwann cell progenitors to intrinsic parasympathetic neurons controlling bronchoconstriction. Our atlas provides a rich resource for further research and a reference for defining deviations from homeostatic and repair mechanisms leading to pulmonary diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01064-x"
"ncb","Quantifying propagation of DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation with iDEMS","DNA methylation is a critical epigenetic mark in mammalian cells. Many aspects of DNA methylation maintenance have been characterized; however, the exact kinetics of post-replicative methylation maintenance remain a subject of debate. Here we develop isolation of DNA by 5-ethynyl-deoxyuridine labelling for mass spectrometry (iDEMS), a highly sensitive, quantitative mass spectrometry-based method for measuring DNA modifications on metabolically labelled DNA. iDEMS reveals an unexpectedly hemi-methylated landscape on nascent DNA. Combining iDEMS with metabolic labelling reveals that methylation maintenance is outpaced by cell division in mouse embryonic stem cells. Our approach shows that hydroxymethylation is perpetually asymmetric between sister strands in favour of the parental, template strand. iDEMS can be coupled with immunoprecipitation of chromatin proteins, revealing features of DNA methylation-histone modification crosstalk and suggesting a model for interplay between methylation and nucleosome assembly. iDEMS therefore elucidates long-standing questions about DNA modification propagation and provides an important orthogonal technology to understanding this process in dynamic cellular contexts.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01048-x"
"ncb","LAP1 supports nuclear adaptability during constrained melanoma cell migration and invasion","Metastasis involves dissemination of cancer cells away from a primary tumour and colonization at distal sites. During this process, the mechanical properties of the nucleus must be tuned since they pose a challenge to the negotiation of physical constraints imposed by the microenvironment and tissue structure. We discovered increased expression of the inner nuclear membrane protein LAP1 in metastatic melanoma cells, at the invasive front of human primary melanoma tumours and in metastases. Human cells express two LAP1 isoforms (LAP1B and LAP1C), which differ in their amino terminus. Here, using in vitro and in vivo models that recapitulate human melanoma progression, we found that expression of the shorter isoform, LAP1C, supports nuclear envelope blebbing, constrained migration and invasion by allowing a weaker coupling between the nuclear envelope and the nuclear lamina. We propose that LAP1 renders the nucleus highly adaptable and contributes to melanoma aggressiveness.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01042-3"
"ncb","OASL phase condensation induces amyloid-like fibrillation of RIPK3 to promote virus-induced necroptosis","RIPK3-ZBP1-MLKL-mediated necroptosis is a proinflammatory cell death process that is crucial for antiviral host defence. RIPK3 self-oligomerization and autophosphorylation are prerequisites for executing necroptosis, yet the underlying mechanism of virus-induced RIPK3 activation remains elusive. Interferon-inducible 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL) protein is devoid of enzymatic function but displays potent antiviral activity. Here we describe a role of OASL as a virus-induced necroptosis promoter that scaffolds the RIPK3-ZBP1 non-canonical necrosome via liquid-like phase condensation. This liquid-like platform of OASL recruits RIPK3 and ZBP1 via protein-protein interactions to provide spatial segregation for RIPK3 nucleation. This process facilitates the amyloid-like fibril formation and activation of RIPK3 and thereby MLKL phosphorylation for necroptosis. Mice deficient in Oasl1 exhibit severely impaired necroptosis and attenuated inflammation after viral infection, resulting in uncontrolled viral dissemination and lethality. Our study demonstrates an interferon-induced innate response whereby OASL scaffolds RIPK3-ZBP1 assembly via its phase-separated liquid droplets to facilitate necroptosis-mediated antiviral immunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01039-y"

Altered metabolism of sphingolipids (SLs) has been linked to development of obesity, type 1 diabetes and T2D (refs. 3,4,5,6,7,8); nonetheless, the role of specific SL species in [beta]-cell function and demise is unclear. Here we define the lipid signature of T2D-associated [beta]-cell failure, including an imbalance of specific very-long-chain SLs and long-chain SLs. [beta]-cell-specific ablation of CerS2, the enzyme necessary for generation of very-long-chain SLs, selectively reduces insulin content, impairs insulin secretion and disturbs systemic glucose tolerance in multiple complementary models. In contrast, ablation of long-chain-SL-synthesizing enzymes has no effect on insulin content. By quantitatively defining the SL-protein interactome, we reveal that CerS2 ablation affects SL binding to several endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi transport proteins, including Tmed2, which we define as an endogenous regulator of the essential proinsulin processing enzyme Pcsk1. Our study uncovers roles for specific SL subtypes and SL-binding proteins in [beta]-cell function and T2D-associated [beta]-cell failure.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01027-2"
"ncb","Caveolin-1 dolines form a distinct and rapid caveolae-independent mechanoadaptation system","In response to different types and intensities of mechanical force, cells modulate their physical properties and adapt their plasma membrane (PM). Caveolae are PM nano-invaginations that contribute to mechanoadaptation, buffering tension changes. However, whether core caveolar proteins contribute to PM tension accommodation independently from the caveolar assembly is unknown. Here we provide experimental and computational evidence supporting that caveolin-1 confers deformability and mechanoprotection independently from caveolae, through modulation of PM curvature. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy reveals that caveolin-1 stabilizes non-caveolar invaginations-dolines-capable of responding to low-medium mechanical forces, impacting downstream mechanotransduction and conferring mechanoprotection to cells devoid of caveolae. Upon cavin-1/PTRF binding, doline size is restricted and membrane buffering is limited to relatively high forces, capable of flattening caveolae. Thus, caveolae and dolines constitute two distinct albeit complementary components of a buffering system that allows cells to adapt efficiently to a broad range of mechanical stimuli.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01034-3"

"ncb","Multivalency ensures persistence of a +TIP body at specialized microtubule ends","Microtubule plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) control microtubule specialization and are as such essential for cell division and morphogenesis. Here we investigated interactions and functions of the budding yeast Kar9 network consisting of the core +TIP proteins Kar9 (functional homologue of APC, MACF and SLAIN), Bim1 (orthologous to EB1) and Bik1 (orthologous to CLIP-170). A multivalent web of redundant interactions links the three +TIPs together to form a '+TIP body' at the end of chosen microtubules. This body behaves as a liquid condensate that allows it to persist on both growing and shrinking microtubule ends, and to function as a mechanical coupling device between microtubules and actin cables. Our study identifies nanometre-scale condensates as effective cellular structures and underlines the power of dissecting the web of low-affinity interactions driving liquid-liquid phase separation in order to establish how condensation processes support cell function.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01035-2"
"ncb","Multivalent interactions facilitate motor-dependent protein accumulation at growing microtubule plus-ends","Growing microtubule ends organize end-tracking proteins into comets of mixed composition. Here using a reconstituted fission yeast system consisting of end-binding protein Mal3, kinesin Tea2 and cargo Tip1, we found that these proteins can be driven into liquid-phase droplets both in solution and at microtubule ends under crowding conditions. In the absence of crowding agents, cryo-electron tomography revealed that motor-dependent comets consist of disordered networks where multivalent interactions may facilitate non-stoichiometric accumulation of cargo Tip1. We found that two disordered protein regions in Mal3 are required for the formation of droplets and motor-dependent accumulation of Tip1, while autonomous Mal3 comet formation requires only one of them. Using theoretical modelling, we explore possible mechanisms by which motor activity and multivalent interactions may lead to the observed enrichment of Tip1 at microtubule ends. We conclude that microtubule ends may act as platforms where multivalent interactions condense microtubule-associated proteins into large multi-protein complexes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01037-0"
"ncb","ER-associated RNA silencing promotes ER quality control","The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) coordinates mRNA translation and processing of secreted and endomembrane proteins. ER-associated degradation (ERAD) prevents the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER, but the physiological regulation of this process remains poorly characterized. Here, in a genetic screen using an ERAD model substrate in Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified an anti-viral RNA interference pathway, referred to as ER-associated RNA silencing (ERAS), which acts together with ERAD to preserve ER homeostasis and function. Induced by ER stress, ERAS is mediated by the Argonaute protein RDE-1/AGO2, is conserved in mammals and promotes ER-associated RNA turnover. ERAS and ERAD are complementary, as simultaneous inactivation of both quality-control pathways leads to increased ER stress, reduced protein quality control and impaired intestinal integrity. Collectively, our findings indicate that ER homeostasis and organismal health are protected by synergistic functions of ERAS and ERAD.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01025-4"
"ncb","Gradual differentiation uncoupled from cell cycle exit generates heterogeneity in the epidermal stem cell layer","Highly regenerative tissues continuously produce terminally differentiated cells to replace those that are lost. How they orchestrate the complex transition from undifferentiated stem cells towards post-mitotic, molecularly distinct and often spatially segregated differentiated populations is not well understood. In the adult skin epidermis, the stem cell compartment contains molecularly heterogeneous subpopulations1,2,3,4 whose relationship to the complete trajectory of differentiation remains unknown. Here we show that differentiation, from commitment to exit from the stem cell layer, is a multi-day process wherein cells transit through a continuum of transcriptional changes with upregulation of differentiation genes preceding downregulation of typical stemness genes. Differentiation-committed cells remain capable of dividing to produce daughter cells fated to further differentiate, demonstrating that differentiation is uncoupled from cell cycle exit. These cell divisions are not required as part of an obligate transit-amplifying programme but help to buffer the differentiating cell pool during heightened demand. Thus, instead of distinct contributions from multiple progenitors, a continuous gradual differentiation process fuels homeostatic epidermal turnover.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-01021-8"
"ncb","Intron-encoded cistronic transcripts for minimally invasive monitoring of coding and non-coding RNAs","Despite their fundamental role in assessing (patho)physiological cell states, conventional gene reporters can follow gene expression but leave scars on the proteins or substantially alter the mature messenger RNA. Multi-time-point measurements of non-coding RNAs are currently impossible without modifying their nucleotide sequence, which can alter their native function, half-life and localization. Thus, we developed the intron-encoded scarless programmable extranuclear cistronic transcript (INSPECT) as a minimally invasive transcriptional reporter embedded within an intron of a gene of interest. Post-transcriptional excision of INSPECT results in the mature endogenous RNA without sequence alterations and an additional engineered transcript that leaves the nucleus by hijacking the nuclear export machinery for subsequent translation into a reporter or effector protein. We showcase its use in monitoring interleukin-2 (IL2) after T cell activation and tracking the transcriptional dynamics of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) NEAT1 during CRISPR interference-mediated perturbation. INSPECT is a method for monitoring gene transcription without altering the mature lncRNA or messenger RNA of the target of interest.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00998-6"
"ncb","The HASTER lncRNA promoter is a cis-acting transcriptional stabilizer of HNF1A","The biological purpose of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is poorly understood. Haploinsufficient mutations in HNF1A homeobox A (HNF1A), encoding a homeodomain transcription factor, cause diabetes mellitus. Here, we examine HASTER, the promoter of an lncRNA antisense to HNF1A. Using mouse and human models, we show that HASTER maintains cell-specific physiological HNF1A concentrations through positive and negative feedback loops. Pancreatic [beta] cells from Haster mutant mice consequently showed variegated HNF1A silencing or overexpression, resulting in hyperglycaemia. HASTER-dependent negative feedback was essential to prevent HNF1A binding to inappropriate genomic regions. We demonstrate that the HASTER promoter DNA, rather than the lncRNA, modulates HNF1A promoter-enhancer interactions in cis and thereby regulates HNF1A transcription. Our studies expose a cis-regulatory element that is unlike classic enhancers or silencers, it stabilizes the transcription of its target gene and ensures the fidelity of a cell-specific transcription factor program. They also show that disruption of a mammalian lncRNA promoter can cause diabetes mellitus.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00996-8"
"ncb","Stem cell-derived synthetic embryos self-assemble by exploiting cadherin codes and cortical tension","Mammalian embryos sequentially differentiate into trophectoderm and an inner cell mass, the latter of which differentiates into primitive endoderm and epiblast. Trophoblast stem (TS), extraembryonic endoderm (XEN) and embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from these three lineages can self-assemble into synthetic embryos, but the mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that a stem cell-specific cadherin code drives synthetic embryogenesis. The XEN cell cadherin code enables XEN cell sorting into a layer below ES cells, recapitulating the sorting of epiblast and primitive endoderm before implantation. The TS cell cadherin code enables TS cell sorting above ES cells, resembling extraembryonic ectoderm clustering above epiblast following implantation. Whereas differential cadherin expression drives initial cell sorting, cortical tension consolidates tissue organization. By optimizing cadherin code expression in different stem cell lines, we tripled the frequency of correctly formed synthetic embryos. Thus, by exploiting cadherin codes from different stages of development, lineage-specific stem cells bypass the preimplantation structure to directly assemble a postimplantation embryo.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00984-y"
"ncb","A Rag GTPase dimer code defines the regulation of mTORC1 by amino acids","Amino acid availability controls mTORC1 activity via a heterodimeric Rag GTPase complex that functions as a scaffold at the lysosomal surface, bringing together mTORC1 with its activators and effectors. Mammalian cells express four Rag proteins (RagA-D) that form dimers composed of RagA/B bound to RagC/D. Traditionally, the Rag paralogue pairs (RagA/B and RagC/D) are referred to as functionally redundant, with the four dimer combinations used interchangeably in most studies. Here, by using genetically modified cell lines that express single Rag heterodimers, we uncover a Rag dimer code that determines how amino acids regulate mTORC1. First, RagC/D differentially define the substrate specificity downstream of mTORC1, with RagD promoting phosphorylation of its lysosomal substrates TFEB/TFE3, while both Rags are involved in the phosphorylation of non-lysosomal substrates such as S6K. Mechanistically, RagD recruits mTORC1 more potently to lysosomes through increased affinity to the anchoring LAMTOR complex. Furthermore, RagA/B specify the signalling response to amino acid removal, with RagB-expressing cells maintaining lysosomal and active mTORC1 even upon starvation. Overall, our findings reveal key qualitative differences between Rag paralogues in the regulation of mTORC1, and underscore Rag gene duplication and diversification as a potentially impactful event in mammalian evolution.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00976-y"
"ncb","Brain-enriched RagB isoforms regulate the dynamics of mTORC1 activity through GATOR1 inhibition","Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) senses nutrient availability to appropriately regulate cellular anabolism and catabolism. During nutrient restriction, different organs in an animal do not respond equally, with vital organs being relatively spared. This raises the possibility that mTORC1 is differentially regulated in different cell types, yet little is known about this mechanistically. The Rag GTPases, RagA or RagB bound to RagC or RagD, tether mTORC1 in a nutrient-dependent manner to lysosomes where mTORC1 becomes activated. Although the RagA and B paralogues were assumed to be functionally equivalent, we find here that the RagB isoforms, which are highly expressed in neurons, impart mTORC1 with resistance to nutrient starvation by inhibiting the RagA/B GTPase-activating protein GATOR1. We further show that high expression of RagB isoforms is observed in some tumours, revealing an alternative strategy by which cancer cells can retain elevated mTORC1 upon low nutrient availability.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00977-x"

However, the sequences of events that orchestrate these intermingled modifications have never been comparatively dissected. Here, we deconvolute the cellular trajectories of reprogramming (via Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/c-Myc) and transformation (via Ras/c-Myc) at the single-cell resolution and reveal how the two processes intersect before they bifurcate. This approach led us to identify the transcription factor Bcl11b as a broad-range regulator of cell fate changes, as well as a pertinent marker to capture early cellular intermediates that emerge simultaneously during reprogramming and transformation. Multiomics characterization of these intermediates unveiled a c-Myc/Atoh8/Sfrp1 regulatory axis that constrains reprogramming, transformation and transdifferentiation. Mechanistically, we found that Atoh8 restrains cellular plasticity, independent of cellular identity, by binding a specific enhancer network. This study provides insights into the partitioned control of cellular plasticity and identity for both regenerative and cancer biology.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00986-w"

This massive multiplexing of CRISPR is enabled by means of multi-target guide RNAs (mgRNAs), degenerate guide RNAs that direct Cas9 to a pre-determined number of well-mapped sites. mgRNAs uncovered generalizable insights into Cas9 binding and cleavage, revealing rapid post-cleavage Cas9 departure and repair factor loading at protospacer adjacent motif-proximal genomic DNA. Moreover, by bypassing confounding effects from guide RNA sequence, mgRNAs unveiled that Cas9 binding is enhanced at chromatin-accessible regions, and cleavage by bound Cas9 is more efficient near transcribed regions. Combined with light-mediated activation and deactivation of Cas9 activity, mgRNAs further enabled high-throughput study of the cellular response to double-strand breaks with high temporal resolution, revealing the presence, extent (under 2 kb) and kinetics (~1 h) of reversible DNA damage-induced chromatin decompaction. Altogether, this work establishes mgRNAs as a generalizable platform for multiplexing CRISPR and advances our understanding of intracellular Cas9 activity and the DNA damage response at endogenous loci.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00975-z"

Although mechanisms of protein targeting to many organelles have been defined, how proteins, such as metabolic enzymes, target from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to cellular lipid droplets (LDs) is poorly understood. Here we identify two distinct pathways for ER-to-LD protein targeting: early targeting at LD formation sites during formation, and late targeting to mature LDs after their formation. Using systematic, unbiased approaches in Drosophila cells, we identified specific membrane-fusion machinery, including regulators, a tether and SNARE proteins, that are required for the late targeting pathway. Components of this fusion machinery localize to LD-ER interfaces and organize at ER exit sites. We identified multiple cargoes for early and late ER-to-LD targeting pathways. Our findings provide a model for how proteins target to LDs from the ER either during LD formation or by protein-catalysed formation of membrane bridges.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00974-0"
"ncb","Nucleotide imbalance decouples cell growth from cell proliferation","Nucleotide metabolism supports RNA synthesis and DNA replication to enable cell growth and division. Nucleotide depletion can inhibit cell growth and proliferation, but how cells sense and respond to changes in the relative levels of individual nucleotides is unclear. Moreover, the nucleotide requirement for biomass production changes over the course of the cell cycle, and how cells coordinate differential nucleotide demands with cell cycle progression is not well understood. Here we find that excess levels of individual nucleotides can inhibit proliferation by disrupting the relative levels of nucleotide bases needed for DNA replication and impeding DNA replication. The resulting purine and pyrimidine imbalances are not sensed by canonical growth regulatory pathways like mTORC1, Akt and AMPK signalling cascades, causing excessive cell growth despite inhibited proliferation. Instead, cells rely on replication stress signalling to survive during, and recover from, nucleotide imbalance during S phase. We find that ATR-dependent replication stress signalling is activated during unperturbed S phases and promotes nucleotide availability to support DNA replication. Together, these data reveal that imbalanced nucleotide levels are not detected until S phase, rendering cells reliant on replication stress signalling to cope with this metabolic problem and disrupting the coordination of cell growth and division.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00965-1"

We investigated whether mesenchymal stem cells, which provide an essential niche for long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) in the bone marrow, reside in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros and contribute to the development of the dorsal aorta and endothelial-to-haematopoietic transition. Here we show that mesoderm-derived PDGFRA+ stromal cells (Mesp1der PSCs) contribute to the haemogenic endothelium of the dorsal aorta and populate the E10.5-E11.5 aorta-gonad-mesonephros but by E13.5 were replaced by neural-crest-derived PSCs (Wnt1der PSCs). Co-aggregating non-haemogenic endothelial cells with Mesp1der PSCs but not Wnt1der PSCs resulted in activation of a haematopoietic transcriptional programme in endothelial cells and generation of LT-HSCs. Dose-dependent inhibition of PDGFRA or BMP, WNT and NOTCH signalling interrupted this reprogramming event.

DNA breaks at potential Z-DNA sites can lead to somatic mutations in cancer or to germline mutations that are transmitted to the next generation. It is not known whether any mechanism exists in the germ line to control Z-DNA structure and DNA breaks at purine-pyrimidine repeats. Here we provide genetic, epigenomic and biochemical evidence for the existence of a biological process that erases Z-DNA specifically in germ cells of the mouse male foetus. We show that a previously uncharacterized zinc finger protein, ZBTB43, binds to and removes Z-DNA, preventing the formation of DNA double-strand breaks. By removing Z-DNA, ZBTB43 also promotes de novo DNA methylation at CG-containing purine-pyrimidine repeats in prospermatogonia. Therefore, the genomic and epigenomic integrity of the species is safeguarded by remodelling DNA structure in the mammalian germ line during a critical window of germline epigenome reprogramming.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00941-9"
"ncb","Actin remodelling controls proteasome homeostasis upon stress","When cells are stressed, bulk translation is often downregulated to reduce energy demands while stress-response proteins are simultaneously upregulated. To promote proteasome assembly and activity and maintain cell viability upon TORC1 inhibition, 19S regulatory-particle assembly chaperones (RPACs) are selectively translated. However, the molecular mechanism for such selective translational upregulation is unclear. Here, using yeast, we discover that remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton is important for RPAC translation following TORC1 inhibition. mRNA of the RPAC ADC17 is associated with actin cables and is enriched at cortical actin patches under stress, dependent upon the early endocytic protein Ede1. ede1∆ cells failed to induce RPACs and proteasome assembly upon TORC1 inhibition. Conversely, artificially tethering ADC17 mRNA to cortical actin patches enhanced its translation upon stress. These findings suggest that actin-dense structures such as cortical actin patches may serve as a translation platform for a subset of stress-induced mRNAs including regulators of proteasome homeostasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00938-4"

In the Caenorhabditis elegans germline, transcripts targeted by sRNAs are used as templates for sRNA amplification to propagate silencing into the next generation. Here we show that RNAi leads to heritable changes in the distribution of nascent and mature transcripts that correlate with two parallel sRNA amplification loops. The first loop, dependent on the nuclear Argonaute HRDE-1, targets nascent transcripts and reduces but does not eliminate productive transcription at the locus. The second loop, dependent on the conserved helicase ZNFX-1, targets mature transcripts and concentrates them in perinuclear condensates. ZNFX-1 interacts with sRNA-targeted transcripts that have acquired poly(UG) tails and is required to sustain pUGylation and robust sRNA amplification in the inheriting generation. By maintaining a pool of transcripts for amplification, ZNFX-1 prevents premature extinction of the RNAi response and extends silencing into the next generation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00940-w"

In inbred mice housed in gnotobiotic facilities, the top of the haematopoietic hierarchy is occupied by dormant HSCs, which reversibly exit quiescence during stress. Whether HSC dormancy exists in humans remains debatable. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing, we show a continuous landscape of highly purified human bone marrow HSCs displaying varying degrees of dormancy. We identify the orphan receptor GPRC5C, which enriches for dormant human HSCs. GPRC5C is also essential for HSC function, as demonstrated by genetic loss- and gain-of-function analyses. Through structural modelling and biochemical assays, we show that hyaluronic acid, a bone marrow extracellular matrix component, preserves dormancy through GPRC5C.

Here we show that a short and early Dual SMAD and WNT inhibition course is necessary and sufficient to establish robust and lasting cortical organoid NSC identity, efficiently suppressing non-cortical NSC fates, while other widely used methods are inconsistent in their cortical NSC-specification capacity. Accordingly, this method selectively enriches for outer radial glia NSCs, which cyto-architecturally demarcate well-defined outer sub-ventricular-like regions propagating from superiorly radially organized, apical cortical rosette NSCs. Finally, this method culminates in the emergence of molecularly distinct deep and upper cortical layer neurons, and reliably uncovers cortex-specific microcephaly defects. Thus, a short SMAD and WNT inhibition is critical for establishing a rich cortical cell repertoire that enables mirroring of fundamental molecular and cyto-architectural features of cortical development and meaningful disease modelling.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00929-5"

Underpinning this property, naive cells are thought to lack chromatin-based lineage barriers. However, this assumption has not been tested. Here we define the chromatin-associated proteome, histone post-translational modifications and transcriptome of human naive and primed pluripotent stem cells. Our integrated analysis reveals differences in the relative abundance and activities of distinct chromatin modules. We identify a strong enrichment of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-associated H3K27me3 in the chromatin of naive pluripotent stem cells and H3K27me3 enrichment at promoters of lineage-determining genes, including trophoblast regulators. PRC2 activity acts as a chromatin barrier restricting the differentiation of naive cells towards the trophoblast lineage, whereas inhibition of PRC2 promotes trophoblast-fate induction and cavity formation in human blastoids. Together, our results establish that human naive pluripotent stem cells are not epigenetically unrestricted, but instead possess chromatin mechanisms that oppose the induction of alternative cell fates.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00932-w"

Here we report a fat-to-neuron lipid signalling pathway induced by lysosomal metabolism and its longevity-promoting role in Caenorhabditis elegans. We discovered that induced lysosomal lipolysis in peripheral fat storage tissue upregulates the neuropeptide signalling pathway in the nervous system to promote longevity. This cell-non-autonomous regulation is mediated by a specific polyunsaturated fatty acid, dihomo-[gamma]-linolenic acid, and LBP-3 lipid chaperone protein transported from the fat storage tissue to neurons. LBP-3 binds to dihomo-[gamma]-linolenic acid, and acts through NHR-49 nuclear receptor and NLP-11 neuropeptide in neurons to extend lifespan. These results reveal lysosomes as a signalling hub to coordinate metabolism and ageing, and lysosomal signalling mediated inter-tissue communication in promoting longevity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00926-8"
"ncb","The metabolic enzyme hexokinase 2 localizes to the nucleus in AML and normal haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells to maintain stemness","Mitochondrial metabolites regulate leukaemic and normal stem cells by affecting epigenetic marks. How mitochondrial enzymes localize to the nucleus to control stem cell function is less understood. We discovered that the mitochondrial metabolic enzyme hexokinase 2 (HK2) localizes to the nucleus in leukaemic and normal haematopoietic stem cells. Overexpression of nuclear HK2 increases leukaemic stem cell properties and decreases differentiation, whereas selective nuclear HK2 knockdown promotes differentiation and decreases stem cell function. Nuclear HK2 localization is phosphorylation-dependent, requires active import and export, and regulates differentiation independently of its enzymatic activity. HK2 interacts with nuclear proteins regulating chromatin openness, increasing chromatin accessibilities at leukaemic stem cell-positive signature and DNA-repair sites. Nuclear HK2 overexpression decreases double-strand breaks and confers chemoresistance, which may contribute to the mechanism by which leukaemic stem cells resist DNA-damaging agents. Thus, we describe a non-canonical mechanism by which mitochondrial enzymes influence stem cell function independently of their metabolic function.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00925-9"
"ncb","METALIC reveals interorganelle lipid flux in live cells by enzymatic mass tagging","The distinct activities of organelles depend on the proper function of their membranes. Coordinated membrane biogenesis of different organelles necessitates lipid transport from their site of synthesis to their destination. Several factors have been proposed to participate in lipid distribution, but despite its basic importance, in vivo evidence linking the absence of putative transport pathways to specific transport defects remains scarce. A reason for this scarcity is the near absence of in vivo lipid trafficking assays. Here we introduce a versatile method named METALIC (Mass tagging-Enabled TrAcking of Lipids In Cells) to track interorganelle lipid flux inside cells. In this strategy, two enzymes, one directed to a 'donor' and the other to an 'acceptor' organelle, add two distinct mass tags to lipids. Mass-spectrometry-based detection of lipids bearing the two mass tags is then used to quantify exchange between the two organelles. By applying this approach, we show that the ERMES and Vps13-Mcp1 complexes have transport activity in vivo, and unravel their relative contributions to endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria lipid exchange.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00917-9"
"ncb","A stromal Integrated Stress Response activates perivascular cancer-associated fibroblasts to drive angiogenesis and tumour progression","Bidirectional signalling between the tumour and stroma shapes tumour aggressiveness and metastasis. ATF4 is a major effector of the Integrated Stress Response, a homeostatic mechanism that couples cell growth and survival to bioenergetic demands. Using conditional knockout ATF4 mice, we show that global, or fibroblast-specific loss of host ATF4, results in deficient vascularization and a pronounced growth delay of syngeneic melanoma and pancreatic tumours. Single-cell transcriptomics of tumours grown in Atf4Δ/Δ mice uncovered a reduction in activation markers in perivascular cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Atf4Δ/Δ fibroblasts displayed significant defects in collagen biosynthesis and deposition and a reduced ability to support angiogenesis. Mechanistically, ATF4 regulates the expression of the Col1a1 gene and levels of glycine and proline, the major amino acids of collagen. Analyses of human melanoma and pancreatic tumours revealed a strong correlation between ATF4 and collagen levels. Our findings establish stromal ATF4 as a key driver of CAF functionality, malignant progression and metastasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00918-8"
"ncb","Polycomb repressive complex 2 shields naïve human pluripotent cells from trophectoderm differentiation","The first lineage choice in human embryo development separates trophectoderm from the inner cell mass. Naïve human embryonic stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass and offer possibilities to explore how lineage integrity is maintained. Here, we discover that polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) maintains naïve pluripotency and restricts differentiation to trophectoderm and mesoderm lineages. Through quantitative epigenome profiling, we found that a broad gain of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) is a distinct feature of naïve pluripotency. We define shared and naïve-specific bivalent promoters featuring PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 concomitant with H3K4me3. Naïve bivalency maintains key trophectoderm and mesoderm transcription factors in a transcriptionally poised state. Inhibition of PRC2 forces naïve human embryonic stem cells into an 'activated' state, characterized by co-expression of pluripotency and lineage-specific transcription factors, followed by differentiation into either trophectoderm or mesoderm lineages. In summary, PRC2-mediated repression provides a highly adaptive mechanism to restrict lineage potential during early human development.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00916-w"
"ncb","Pan-cancer pervasive upregulation of 3' UTR splicing drives tumourigenesis","Most mammalian genes generate messenger RNAs with variable untranslated regions (UTRs) that are important post-transcriptional regulators. In cancer, shortening at 3' UTR ends via alternative polyadenylation can activate oncogenes. However, internal 3' UTR splicing remains poorly understood as splicing studies have traditionally focused on protein-coding alterations. Here we systematically map the pan-cancer landscape of 3' UTR splicing and present this in SpUR (http://www.cbrc.kaust.edu.sa/spur/home/). 3' UTR splicing is widespread, upregulated in cancers, correlated with poor prognosis and more prevalent in oncogenes. We show that antisense oligonucleotide-mediated inhibition of 3' UTR splicing efficiently reduces oncogene expression and impedes tumour progression. Notably, CTNNB1 3' UTR splicing is the most consistently dysregulated event across cancers. We validate its upregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma, and show that the spliced 3' UTR variant is the predominant contributor to its oncogenic functions. Overall, our study highlights the importance of 3' UTR splicing in cancer and may launch new avenues for RNA-based anti-cancer therapeutics.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00913-z"
"ncb","Proton-gated anion transport governs macropinosome shrinkage","Intracellular organelles change their size during trafficking and maturation. This requires the transport of ions and water across their membranes. Macropinocytosis, a ubiquitous form of endocytosis of particular importance for immune and cancer cells, generates large vacuoles that can be followed optically. Shrinkage of macrophage macropinosomes depends on TPC-mediated Na+ efflux and Cl− exit through unknown channels. Relieving osmotic pressure facilitates vesicle budding, positioning osmotic shrinkage upstream of vesicular sorting and trafficking. Here we identify the missing macrophage Cl− channel as the proton-activated Cl− channel ASOR/TMEM206. ASOR activation requires Na+-mediated depolarization and luminal acidification by redundant transporters including H+-ATPases and CLC 2Cl−/H+ exchangers. As corroborated by mathematical modelling, feedback loops requiring the steep voltage and pH dependencies of ASOR and CLCs render vacuole resolution resilient towards transporter copy numbers. TMEM206 disruption increased albumin-dependent survival of cancer cells. Our work suggests a function for the voltage and pH dependence of ASOR and CLCs, provides a comprehensive model for ion-transport-dependent vacuole maturation and reveals biological roles of ASOR.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00912-0"
"ncb","Epicardium-derived cells organize through tight junctions to replenish cardiac muscle in salamanders","The contribution of the epicardium, the outermost layer of the heart, to cardiac regeneration has remained controversial due to a lack of suitable analytical tools. By combining genetic marker-independent lineage-tracing strategies with transcriptional profiling and loss-of-function methods, we report here that the epicardium of the highly regenerative salamander species Pleurodeles waltl has an intrinsic capacity to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Following cryoinjury, CLDN6+ epicardium-derived cells appear at the lesion site, organize into honeycomb-like structures connected via focal tight junctions and undergo transcriptional reprogramming that results in concomitant differentiation into de novo cardiomyocytes. Ablation of CLDN6+ differentiation intermediates as well as disruption of their tight junctions impairs cardiac regeneration. Salamanders constitute the evolutionarily closest species to mammals with an extensive ability to regenerate heart muscle and our results highlight the epicardium and tight junctions as key targets in efforts to promote cardiac regeneration.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00902-2"
"ncb","Sox2 levels regulate the chromatin occupancy of WNT mediators in epiblast progenitors responsible for vertebrate body formation","WNT signalling has multiple roles. It maintains pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, assigns posterior identity in the epiblast and induces mesodermal tissue. Here we provide evidence that these distinct functions are conducted by the transcription factor SOX2, which adopts different modes of chromatin interaction and regulatory element selection depending on its level of expression. At high levels, SOX2 displaces nucleosomes from regulatory elements with high-affinity SOX2 binding sites, recruiting the WNT effector TCF/[beta]-catenin and maintaining pluripotent gene expression. Reducing SOX2 levels destabilizes pluripotency and reconfigures SOX2/TCF/[beta]-catenin occupancy to caudal epiblast expressed genes. These contain low-affinity SOX2 sites and are co-occupied by T/Bra and CDX. The loss of SOX2 allows WNT-induced mesodermal differentiation. These findings define a role for Sox2 levels in dictating the chromatin occupancy of TCF/[beta]-catenin and reveal how context-specific responses to a signal are configured by the level of a transcription factor.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00910-2"
"ncb","Migratory and anti-fibrotic programmes define the regenerative potential of human cardiac progenitors","Heart regeneration is an unmet clinical need, hampered by limited renewal of adult cardiomyocytes and fibrotic scarring. Pluripotent stem cell-based strategies are emerging, but unravelling cellular dynamics of host-graft crosstalk remains elusive. Here, by combining lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics in injured non-human primate heart biomimics, we uncover the coordinated action modes of human progenitor-mediated muscle repair. Chemoattraction via CXCL12/CXCR4 directs cellular migration to injury sites. Activated fibroblast repulsion targets fibrosis by SLIT2/ROBO1 guidance in organizing cytoskeletal dynamics. Ultimately, differentiation and electromechanical integration lead to functional restoration of damaged heart muscle. In vivo transplantation into acutely and chronically injured porcine hearts illustrated CXCR4-dependent homing, de novo formation of heart muscle, scar-volume reduction and prevention of heart failure progression. Concurrent endothelial differentiation contributed to graft neovascularization. Our study demonstrates that inherent developmental programmes within cardiac progenitors are sequentially activated in disease, enabling the cells to sense and counteract acute and chronic injury.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00899-8"
"ncb","Cell cycle-specific phase separation regulated by protein charge blockiness","Dynamic morphological changes of intracellular organelles are often regulated by protein phosphorylation or dephosphorylation1,2,3,4,5,6. Phosphorylation modulates stereospecific interactions among structured proteins, but how it controls molecular interactions among unstructured proteins and regulates their macroscopic behaviours remains unknown. Here we determined the cell cycle-specific behaviour of Ki-67, which localizes to the nucleoli during interphase and relocates to the chromosome periphery during mitosis. Mitotic hyperphosphorylation of disordered repeat domains of Ki-67 generates alternating charge blocks in these domains and increases their propensity for liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). A phosphomimetic sequence and the sequences with enhanced charge blockiness underwent strong LLPS in vitro and induced chromosome periphery formation in vivo. Conversely, mitotic hyperphosphorylation of NPM1 diminished a charge block and suppressed LLPS, resulting in nucleolar dissolution. Cell cycle-specific phase separation can be modulated via phosphorylation by enhancing or reducing the charge blockiness of disordered regions, rather than by attaching phosphate groups to specific sites.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00903-1"
"ncb","NANOG prion-like assembly mediates DNA bridging to facilitate chromatin reorganization and activation of pluripotency","Human NANOG expression resets stem cells to ground-state pluripotency. Here we identify the unique features of human NANOG that relate to its dose-sensitive function as a master transcription factor. NANOG is largely disordered, with a C-terminal prion-like domain that phase-transitions to gel-like condensates. Full-length NANOG readily forms higher-order oligomers at low nanomolar concentrations, orders of magnitude lower than typical amyloids. Using single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer and fluorescence cross-correlation techniques, we show that NANOG oligomerization is essential for bridging DNA elements in vitro. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and Hi-C 3.0 in cells, we validate that NANOG prion-like domain assembly is essential for specific DNA recognition and distant chromatin interactions. Our results provide a physical basis for the indispensable role of NANOG in shaping the pluripotent genome. NANOG's unique ability to form prion-like assemblies could provide a cooperative and concerted DNA bridging mechanism that is essential for chromatin reorganization and dose-sensitive activation of ground-state pluripotency.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00896-x"
"ncb","CDK1-cyclin-B1-induced kindlin degradation drives focal adhesion disassembly at mitotic entry","The disassembly of integrin-containing focal adhesions (FAs) at mitotic entry is essential for cell rounding, mitotic retraction fibre formation, bipolar spindle positioning and chromosome segregation. The mechanism that drives FA disassembly at mitotic entry is unknown. Here, we show that the CDK1-cyclin B1 complex phosphorylates the integrin activator kindlin, which results in the recruitment of the cullin 9-FBXL10 ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates kindlin ubiquitination and degradation. This molecular pathway is essential for FA disassembly and cell rounding, as phospho-inhibitory mutations of the CDK1 motif prevent kindlin degradation, FA disassembly and mitotic cell rounding. Conversely, phospho-mimetic mutations promote kindlin degradation in interphase, accelerate mitotic cell rounding and impair mitotic retraction fibre formation. Despite the opposing effects on kindlin stability, both types of mutations cause severe mitotic spindle defects, apoptosis and aneuploidy. Thus, the exquisite regulation of kindlin levels at mitotic entry is essential for cells to progress accurately through mitosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00886-z"
"ncb","Aggresome assembly at the centrosome is driven by CP110-CEP97-CEP290 and centriolar satellites","Protein degradation is critical to maintaining cellular homeostasis, and perturbation of the ubiquitin proteasome system leads to the accumulation of protein aggregates. These aggregates are either directed towards autophagy for destruction or sequestered into an inclusion, termed the aggresome, at the centrosome. Utilizing high-resolution quantitative analysis, here, we define aggresome assembly at the centrosome in human cells. Centriolar satellites are proteinaceous granules implicated in the trafficking of proteins to the centrosome. During aggresome assembly, satellites were required for the growth of the aggresomal structure from an initial ring of phosphorylated HSP27 deposited around the centrioles. The seeding of this phosphorylated HSP27 ring depended on the centrosomal proteins CP110, CEP97 and CEP290. Owing to limiting amounts of CP110, senescent cells, which are characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates, were defective in aggresome formation. Furthermore, satellites and CP110-CEP97-CEP290 were required for the aggregation of mutant huntingtin. Together, these data reveal roles for CP110-CEP97-CEP290 and satellites in the control of cellular proteostasis and the aggregation of disease-relevant proteins.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00869-0"

However, our understanding of lymphoma NHCs has been hampered by unexplained NHC heterogeneity, even in normal human lymph nodes (LNs). Here we constructed a single-cell transcriptome atlas of more than 100,000 NHCs collected from 27 human samples, including LNs and various nodal lymphomas, and it revealed 30 distinct subclusters, including some that were previously unrecognized. Notably, this atlas was useful for comparative analyses with lymphoma NHCs, which revealed an unanticipated landscape of subcluster-specific changes in gene expression and interaction with malignant cells in follicular lymphoma NHCs. This facilitates our understanding of stromal remodelling in lymphoma and highlights potential clinical biomarkers. Our study largely updates NHC taxonomy in human LNs and analysis of disease status, and provides a rich resource and deeper insights into LN and lymphoma biology to advance lymphoma management and therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00866-3"
"ncb","Gasdermin E mediates resistance of pancreatic adenocarcinoma to enzymatic digestion through a YBX1-mucin pathway","Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) originates from normal pancreatic ducts where digestive juice is regularly produced. It remains unclear how PDAC can escape autodigestion by digestive enzymes. Here we show that human PDAC tumour cells use gasdermin E (GSDME), a pore-forming protein, to mediate digestive resistance. GSDME facilitates the tumour cells to express mucin 1 and mucin 13, which form a barrier to prevent chymotrypsin-mediated destruction. Inoculation of GSDME−/− PDAC cells results in subcutaneous but not orthotopic tumour formation in mice. Inhibition or knockout of mucin 1 or mucin 13 abrogates orthotopic PDAC growth in NOD-SCID mice. Mechanistically, GSDME interacts with and transports YBX1 into the nucleus where YBX1 directly promotes mucin expression. This GSDME-YBX1-mucin axis is also confirmed in patients with PDAC. These findings uncover a unique survival mechanism of PDAC cells in pancreatic microenvironments.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00857-4"
"ncb","Pseudouridine-modified tRNA fragments repress aberrant protein synthesis and predict leukaemic progression in myelodysplastic syndrome","Transfer RNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are emerging small noncoding RNAs that, although commonly altered in cancer, have poorly defined roles in tumorigenesis1. Here we show that pseudouridylation (Ψ) of a stem cell-enriched tRF subtype2, mini tRFs containing a 5' terminal oligoguanine (mTOG), selectively inhibits aberrant protein synthesis programmes, thereby promoting engraftment and differentiation of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Building on evidence that mTOG-Ψ targets polyadenylate-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1), we employed isotope exchange proteomics to reveal critical interactions between mTOG and functional RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domains of PABPC1. Mechanistically, this hinders the recruitment of translational co-activator PABPC1-interacting protein 1 (PAIP1)3 and strongly represses the translation of transcripts sharing pyrimidine-enriched sequences (PES) at the 5' untranslated region (UTR), including 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tracts (TOP) that encode protein machinery components and are frequently altered in cancer4. Significantly, mTOG dysregulation leads to aberrantly increased translation of 5' PES messenger RNA (mRNA) in malignant MDS-HSPCs and is clinically associated with leukaemic transformation and reduced patient survival. These findings define a critical role for tRFs and Ψ in difficult-to-treat subsets of MDS characterized by high risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-022-00852-9"

Exemplified by CRISPR-Cas, gene editing could cause DNA damage and trigger DNA repair processes that are often error-prone. Such unwanted mutations and safety concerns can be exacerbated when altering long sequences. Here we couple microbial single-strand annealing proteins (SSAPs) with catalytically inactive dCas9 for gene editing. This cleavage-free gene editor, dCas9-SSAP, promotes the knock-in of long sequences in mammalian cells. The dCas9-SSAP editor has low on-target errors and minimal off-target effects, showing higher accuracy than canonical Cas9 methods. It is effective for inserting kilobase-scale sequences, with an efficiency of up to approximately 20% and robust performance across donor designs and cell types, including human stem cells. We show that dCas9-SSAP is less sensitive to inhibition of DNA repair enzymes than Cas9 references. We further performed truncation and aptamer engineering to minimize its size to fit into a single adeno-associated-virus vector for future application. Together, this tool opens opportunities towards safer long-sequence genome engineering.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00836-1"
"ncb","The ubiquitin-dependent ATPase p97 removes cytotoxic trapped PARP1 from chromatin","Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors elicit antitumour activity in homologous recombination-defective cancers by trapping PARP1 in a chromatin-bound state. How cells process trapped PARP1 remains unclear. Using wild-type and a trapping-deficient PARP1 mutant combined with rapid immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of endogenous proteins and Apex2 proximity labelling, we delineated mass spectrometry-based interactomes of trapped and non-trapped PARP1. These analyses identified an interaction between trapped PARP1 and the ubiquitin-regulated p97 ATPase/segregase. We found that following trapping, PARP1 is SUMOylated by PIAS4 and subsequently ubiquitylated by the SUMO-targeted E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF4, events that promote recruitment of p97 and removal of trapped PARP1 from chromatin. Small-molecule p97-complex inhibitors, including a metabolite of the clinically used drug disulfiram (CuET), prolonged PARP1 trapping and enhanced PARP inhibitor-induced cytotoxicity in homologous recombination-defective tumour cells and patient-derived tumour organoids. Together, these results suggest that p97 ATPase plays a key role in the processing of trapped PARP1 and the response of tumour cells to PARP inhibitors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00807-6"

Here we report the discovery of a distinct extracellular nanoparticle, termed supermere. Supermeres are morphologically distinct from exomeres and display a markedly greater uptake in vivo compared with small extracellular vesicles and exomeres. The protein and RNA composition of supermeres differs from small extracellular vesicles and exomeres. Supermeres are highly enriched with cargo involved in multiple cancers (glycolytic enzymes, TGFBI, miR-1246, MET, GPC1 and AGO2), Alzheimer's disease (APP) and cardiovascular disease (ACE2, ACE and PCSK9). The majority of extracellular RNA is associated with supermeres rather than small extracellular vesicles and exomeres. Cancer-derived supermeres increase lactate secretion, transfer cetuximab resistance and decrease hepatic lipids and glycogen in vivo.

However, the underlying mechanisms are only partially understood. Here we implicate the histone H3.3 chaperone Daxx, a retrotransposable element repressor inactivated in myeloid leukaemia and other neoplasms, in protection from inflammatory disease. Loss of Daxx alters the chromatin landscape, H3.3 distribution and histone marks of haematopoietic progenitors, leading to engagement of a Pu.1-dependent transcriptional programme for myelopoiesis at the expense of B-cell differentiation. This causes neutrophilia and inflammation, predisposing mice to develop an autoinflammatory skin disease. While these molecular and phenotypic perturbations are in part reverted in animals lacking both Pu.1 and Daxx, haematopoietic progenitors in these mice show unique chromatin and transcriptome alterations, suggesting an interaction between these two pathways. Overall, our findings implicate retrotransposable element silencing in haematopoiesis and suggest a cross-talk between the H3.3 loading machinery and the pioneer transcription factor Pu.1.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00774-y"
"ncb","XRCC1 protects transcription from toxic PARP1 activity during DNA base excision repair","Genetic defects in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) can result in neurological disease triggered by toxic activity of the single-strand-break sensor protein PARP1. However, the mechanism(s) by which this toxic PARP1 activity triggers cellular dysfunction are unclear. Here we show that human cells lacking XRCC1 fail to rapidly recover transcription following DNA base damage, a phenotype also observed in patient-derived fibroblasts with XRCC1 mutations and Xrcc1−/− mouse neurons. This defect is caused by excessive/aberrant PARP1 activity during DNA base excision repair, resulting from the loss of PARP1 regulation by XRCC1. We show that aberrant PARP1 activity suppresses transcriptional recovery during base excision repair by promoting excessive recruitment and activity of the ubiquitin protease USP3, which as a result reduces the level of monoubiquitinated histones important for normal transcriptional regulation. Importantly, inhibition and/or deletion of PARP1 or USP3 restores transcriptional recovery in XRCC1−/− cells, highlighting PARP1 and USP3 as possible therapeutic targets in neurological disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00792-w"
"ncb","H3K9me selectively blocks transcription factor activity and ensures differentiated tissue integrity","The developmental role of histone H3K9 methylation (H3K9me), which typifies heterochromatin, remains unclear. In Caenorhabditis elegans, loss of H3K9me leads to a highly divergent upregulation of genes with tissue and developmental-stage specificity. During development H3K9me is lost from differentiated cell type-specific genes and gained at genes expressed in earlier developmental stages or other tissues. The continuous deposition of H3K9me2 by the SETDB1 homolog MET-2 after terminal differentiation is necessary to maintain repression. In differentiated tissues, H3K9me ensures silencing by restricting the activity of a defined set of transcription factors at promoters and enhancers. Increased chromatin accessibility following the loss of H3K9me is neither sufficient nor necessary to drive transcription. Increased ATAC-seq signal and gene expression correlate at a subset of loci positioned away from the nuclear envelope, while derepressed genes at the nuclear periphery remain poorly accessible despite being transcribed. In conclusion, H3K9me deposition can confer tissue-specific gene expression and maintain the integrity of terminally differentiated muscle by restricting transcription factor activity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00776-w"

"ncb","Formation of spermatogonia and fertile oocytes in golden hamsters requires piRNAs","PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) support the germline by suppressing retrotransposons. Studies of the pathway in mice have strongly shaped the view that mammalian piRNAs are essential for male but not for female fertility. Here, we report that the role of the piRNA pathway substantially differs in golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), the piRNA pathway setup of which more closely resembles that of other mammals, including humans. The loss of the Mov10l1 RNA helicase-an essential piRNA biogenesis factor-leads to striking phenotypes in both sexes. In contrast to mice, female Mov10l1-/- hamsters are sterile because their oocytes do not sustain zygotic development. Furthermore, Mov10l1-/- male hamsters have impaired establishment of spermatogonia accompanied by transcriptome dysregulation and an expression surge of a young retrotransposon subfamily. Our results show that the mammalian piRNA pathway has essential roles in both sexes and its adaptive nature allows it to manage emerging genomic threats and acquire new critical roles in the germline.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00746-2"
"ncb","Chemotherapy-induced transposable elements activate MDA5 to enhance haematopoietic regeneration","Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are normally quiescent, but have evolved mechanisms to respond to stress. Here, we evaluate haematopoietic regeneration induced by chemotherapy. We detect robust chromatin reorganization followed by increased transcription of transposable elements (TEs) during early recovery. TE transcripts bind to and activate the innate immune receptor melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) that generates an inflammatory response that is necessary for HSCs to exit quiescence. HSCs that lack MDA5 exhibit an impaired inflammatory response after chemotherapy and retain their quiescence, with consequent better long-term repopulation capacity. We show that the overexpression of ERV and LINE superfamily TE copies in wild-type HSCs, but not in Mda5−/− HSCs, results in their cycling. By contrast, after knockdown of LINE1 family copies, HSCs retain their quiescence. Our results show that TE transcripts act as ligands that activate MDA5 during haematopoietic regeneration, thereby enabling HSCs to mount an inflammatory response necessary for their exit from quiescence.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00707-9"
"ncb","Epithelial cell plasticity drives endoderm formation during gastrulation","It is generally accepted that epiblast cells ingress into the primitive streak by epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to give rise to the mesoderm; however, it is less clear how the endoderm acquires an epithelial fate. Here, we used embryonic stem cell and mouse embryo knock‐in reporter systems to combine time-resolved lineage labelling with high-resolution single-cell transcriptomics. This allowed us to resolve the morphogenetic programs that segregate the mesoderm from the endoderm germ layer. Strikingly, while the mesoderm is formed by classical EMT, the endoderm is formed independent of the key EMT transcription factor Snail1 by mechanisms of epithelial cell plasticity. Importantly, forkhead box transcription factor A2 (Foxa2) acts as an epithelial gatekeeper and EMT suppressor to shield the endoderm from undergoing a mesenchymal transition. Altogether, these results not only establish the morphogenetic details of germ layer formation, but also have broader implications for stem cell differentiation and cancer metastasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00694-x"
"ncb","Non-invasive and high-throughput interrogation of exon-specific isoform expression","Expression of exon-specific isoforms from alternatively spliced mRNA is a fundamental mechanism that substantially expands the proteome of a cell. However, conventional methods to assess alternative splicing are either consumptive and work-intensive or do not quantify isoform expression longitudinally at the protein level. Here, we therefore developed an exon-specific isoform expression reporter system (EXSISERS), which non-invasively reports the translation of exon-containing isoforms of endogenous genes by scarlessly excising reporter proteins from the nascent polypeptide chain through highly efficient, intein-mediated protein splicing. We applied EXSISERS to quantify the inclusion of the disease-associated exon 10 in microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and screened Cas13-based RNA-targeting effectors for isoform specificity. We also coupled cell survival to the inclusion of exon 18b of FOXP1, which is involved in maintaining pluripotency of embryonic stem cells, and confirmed that MBNL1 is a dominant factor for exon 18b exclusion.

Here, we show that the metabolite S-2-hydroxyglutarate (S-2HG) plays a crucial role in the regulation of endothelial quiescence. We find that S-2HG is produced in ECs after activation of the transcription factor forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), where it limits cell cycle progression, metabolic activity and vascular expansion. FOXO1 stimulates S-2HG production by inhibiting the mitochondrial enzyme 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. This inhibition relies on branched-chain amino acid catabolites such as 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate, which increase in ECs with activated FOXO1. Treatment of ECs with 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate elicits S-2HG production and suppresses proliferation, causing vascular rarefaction in mice. Our findings identify a metabolic programme that promotes the acquisition of a quiescent endothelial state and highlight the role of metabolites as signalling molecules in the endothelium.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00637-6"
"ncb","Opposing Wnt signals regulate cervical squamocolumnar homeostasis and emergence of metaplasia","The transition zones of the squamous and columnar epithelia constitute hotspots for the emergence of cancer, often preceded by metaplasia, in which one epithelial type is replaced by another. It remains unclear how the epithelial spatial organization is maintained and how the transition zone niche is remodelled during metaplasia. Here we used single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize epithelial subpopulations and the underlying stromal compartment of endo- and ectocervix, encompassing the transition zone. Mouse lineage tracing, organoid culture and single-molecule RNA in situ hybridizations revealed that the two epithelia derive from separate cervix-resident lineage-specific stem cell populations regulated by opposing Wnt signals from the stroma. Using a mouse model of cervical metaplasia, we further show that the endocervical stroma undergoes remodelling and increases expression of the Wnt inhibitor Dickkopf-2 (DKK2), promoting the outgrowth of ectocervical stem cells. Our data indicate that homeostasis at the transition zone results from divergent stromal signals, driving the differential proliferation of resident epithelial lineages.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-020-00619-0"
