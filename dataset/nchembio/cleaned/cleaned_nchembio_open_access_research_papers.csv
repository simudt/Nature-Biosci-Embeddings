"nchembio","Molecular basis for ubiquitin/Fubi cross-reactivity in USP16 and USP36","Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins typically use distinct machineries to facilitate diverse functions. The immunosuppressive ubiquitin-like protein Fubi is synthesized as an N-terminal fusion to a ribosomal protein (Fubi-S30). Its proteolytic maturation by the nucleolar deubiquitinase USP36 is strictly required for translationally competent ribosomes. What endows USP36 with this activity, how Fubi is recognized and whether other Fubi proteases exist are unclear. Here, we report a chemical tool kit that facilitated the discovery of dual ubiquitin/Fubi cleavage activity in USP16 in addition to USP36 by chemoproteomics. Crystal structures of USP36 complexed with Fubi and ubiquitin uncover its substrate recognition mechanism and explain how other deubiquitinases are restricted from Fubi. Furthermore, we introduce Fubi C-terminal hydrolase measurements and reveal a synergistic role of USP16 in Fubi-S30 maturation. Our data highlight how ubiquitin/Fubi specificity is achieved in a subset of human deubiquitinases and open the door to a systematic investigation of the Fubi system.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01388-1"
"nchembio","Engineering cellular communication between light-activated synthetic cells and bacteria","Gene-expressing compartments assembled from simple, modular parts, are a versatile platform for creating minimal synthetic cells with life-like functions. By incorporating gene regulatory motifs into their encapsulated DNA templates, in situ gene expression and, thereby, synthetic cell function can be controlled according to specific stimuli. In this work, cell-free protein synthesis within synthetic cells was controlled using light by encoding genes of interest on light-activated DNA templates. Light-activated DNA contained a photocleavable blockade within the T7 promoter region that tightly repressed transcription until the blocking groups were removed with ultraviolet light. In this way, synthetic cells were activated remotely, in a spatiotemporally controlled manner. By applying this strategy to the expression of an acyl homoserine lactone synthase, BjaI, quorum-sensing-based communication between synthetic cells and bacteria was controlled with light. This work provides a framework for the remote-controlled production and delivery of small molecules from nonliving matter to living matter, with applications in biology and medicine.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01374-7"
"nchembio","Discovery of VH domains that allosterically inhibit ENPP1","Ectodomain phosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (ENPP1) is overexpressed on cancer cells and functions as an innate immune checkpoint by hydrolyzing extracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP). Biologic inhibitors have not yet been reported and could have substantial therapeutic advantages over current small molecules because they can be recombinantly engineered into multifunctional formats and immunotherapies. Here we used phage and yeast display coupled with in cellulo evolution to generate variable heavy (VH) single-domain antibodies against ENPP1 and discovered a VH domain that allosterically inhibited the hydrolysis of cGAMP and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). We solved a 3.2 Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure for the VH inhibitor complexed with ENPP1 that confirmed its new allosteric binding pose. Finally, we engineered the VH domain into multispecific formats and immunotherapies, including a bispecific fusion with an anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor that showed potent cellular activity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01368-5"
"nchembio","An anti-biofilm cyclic peptide targets a secreted aminopeptidase from P. aeruginosa","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes serious illness, especially in immunocompromised individuals. P. aeruginosa forms biofilms that contribute to growth and persistence in a wide range of environments. Here we investigated the aminopeptidase, P. aeruginosa aminopeptidase (PaAP) from P. aeruginosa, which is highly abundant in the biofilm matrix. PaAP is associated with biofilm development and contributes to nutrient recycling. We confirmed that post-translational processing was required for activation and PaAP is a promiscuous aminopeptidase acting on unstructured regions of peptides and proteins. Crystal structures of wild-type enzymes and variants revealed the mechanism of autoinhibition, whereby the C-terminal propeptide locks the protease-associated domain and the catalytic peptidase domain into a self-inhibited conformation. Inspired by this, we designed a highly potent small cyclic-peptide inhibitor that recapitulates the deleterious phenotype observed with a PaAP deletion variant in biofilm assays and present a path toward targeting secreted proteins in a biofilm context.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01373-8"
"nchembio","Direct stimulation of de novo nucleotide synthesis by O-GlcNAcylation","O-linked [beta]-N-acetyl glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) is at the crossroads of cellular metabolism, including glucose and glutamine; its dysregulation leads to molecular and pathological alterations that cause diseases. Here we report that O-GlcNAc directly regulates de novo nucleotide synthesis and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) production upon abnormal metabolic states. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRPS1), the key enzyme of the de novo nucleotide synthesis pathway, is O-GlcNAcylated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which triggers PRPS1 hexamer formation and relieves nucleotide product-mediated feedback inhibition, thereby boosting PRPS1 activity. PRPS1 O-GlcNAcylation blocked AMPK binding and inhibited AMPK-mediated PRPS1 phosphorylation. OGT still regulates PRPS1 activity in AMPK-deficient cells. Elevated PRPS1 O-GlcNAcylation promotes tumorigenesis and confers resistance to chemoradiotherapy in lung cancer. Furthermore, Arts-syndrome-associated PRPS1 R196W mutant exhibits decreased PRPS1 O-GlcNAcylation and activity. Together, our findings establish a direct connection among O-GlcNAc signals, de novo nucleotide synthesis and human diseases, including cancer and Arts syndrome.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01354-x"
"nchembio","A general method for the development of multicolor biosensors with large dynamic ranges","Fluorescent biosensors enable the study of cell physiology with spatiotemporal resolution; yet, most biosensors suffer from relatively low dynamic ranges. Here, we introduce a family of designed Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs with near-quantitative FRET efficiencies based on the reversible interaction of fluorescent proteins with a fluorescently labeled HaloTag. These FRET pairs enabled the straightforward design of biosensors for calcium, ATP and NAD+ with unprecedented dynamic ranges. The color of each of these biosensors can be readily tuned by changing either the fluorescent protein or the synthetic fluorophore, which enables simultaneous monitoring of free NAD+ in different subcellular compartments following genotoxic stress. Minimal modifications of these biosensors furthermore allow their readout to be switched to fluorescence intensity, fluorescence lifetime or bioluminescence. These FRET pairs thus establish a new concept for the development of highly sensitive and tunable biosensors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01350-1"
"nchembio","A multi-enzyme machine polymerizes the Haemophilus influenzae type b capsule","Bacterial capsules have critical roles in host-pathogen interactions. They provide a protective envelope against host recognition, leading to immune evasion and bacterial survival. Here we define the capsule biosynthesis pathway of Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib), a Gram-negative bacterium that causes severe infections in infants and children. Reconstitution of this pathway enabled the fermentation-free production of Hib vaccine antigens starting from widely available precursors and detailed characterization of the enzymatic machinery. The X-ray crystal structure of the capsule polymerase Bcs3 reveals a multi-enzyme machine adopting a basket-like shape that creates a protected environment for the synthesis of the complex Hib polymer. This architecture is commonly exploited for surface glycan synthesis by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Supported by biochemical studies and comprehensive 2D nuclear magnetic resonance, our data explain how the ribofuranosyltransferase CriT, the phosphatase CrpP, the ribitol-phosphate transferase CroT and a polymer-binding domain function as a unique multi-enzyme assembly.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01324-3"
"nchembio","Spontaneously established syntrophic yeast communities improve bioproduction","Nutritional codependence (syntrophy) has underexplored potential to improve biotechnological processes by using cooperating cell types. So far, design of yeast syntrophic communities has required extensive genetic manipulation, as the co-inoculation of most eukaryotic microbial auxotrophs does not result in cooperative growth. Here we employ high-throughput phenotypic screening to systematically test pairwise combinations of auxotrophic Saccharomyces cerevisiae deletion mutants. Although most coculture pairs do not enter syntrophic growth, we identify 49 pairs that spontaneously form syntrophic, synergistic communities. We characterized the stability and growth dynamics of nine cocultures and demonstrated that a pair of tryptophan auxotrophs grow by exchanging a pathway intermediate rather than end products. We then introduced a malonic semialdehyde biosynthesis pathway split between different pairs of auxotrophs, which resulted in increased production. Our results report the spontaneous formation of stable syntrophy in S. cerevisiae auxotrophs and illustrate the biotechnological potential of dividing labor in a cooperating intraspecies community.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01341-2"
"nchembio","Nonmonotone invasion landscape by noise-aware control of metastasis activator levels","A major pharmacological assumption is that lowering disease-promoting protein levels is generally beneficial. For example, inhibiting metastasis activator BACH1 is proposed to decrease cancer metastases. Testing such assumptions requires approaches to measure disease phenotypes while precisely adjusting disease-promoting protein levels. Here we developed a two-step strategy to integrate protein-level tuning, noise-aware synthetic gene circuits into a well-defined human genomic safe harbor locus. Unexpectedly, engineered MDA-MB-231 metastatic human breast cancer cells become more, then less and then more invasive as we tune BACH1 levels up, irrespective of the native BACH1. BACH1 expression shifts in invading cells, and expression of BACH1ʼs transcriptional targets confirm BACH1ʼs nonmonotone phenotypic and regulatory effects. Thus, chemical inhibition of BACH1 could have unwanted effects on invasion. Additionally, BACH1ʼs expression variability aids invasion at high BACH1 expression. Overall, precisely engineered, noise-aware protein-level control is necessary and important to unravel disease effects of genes to improve clinical drug efficacy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01344-z"
"nchembio","Single-cell multi-omics in the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus","Advances in omics technologies now permit the generation of highly contiguous genome assemblies, detection of transcripts and metabolites at the level of single cells and high-resolution determination of gene regulatory features. Here, using a complementary, multi-omics approach, we interrogated the monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) biosynthetic pathway in Catharanthus roseus, a source of leading anticancer drugs. We identified clusters of genes involved in MIA biosynthesis on the eight C. roseus chromosomes and extensive gene duplication of MIA pathway genes. Clustering was not limited to the linear genome, and through chromatin interaction data, MIA pathway genes were present within the same topologically associated domain, permitting the identification of a secologanin transporter. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed sequential cell-type-specific partitioning of the leaf MIA biosynthetic pathway that, when coupled with a single-cell metabolomics approach, permitted the identification of a reductase that yields the bis-indole alkaloid anhydrovinblastine. We also revealed cell-type-specific expression in the root MIA pathway.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01327-0"
"nchembio","Signal peptide mimicry primes Sec61 for client-selective inhibition","Preventing the biogenesis of disease-relevant proteins is an attractive therapeutic strategy, but attempts to target essential protein biogenesis factors have been hampered by excessive toxicity. Here we describe KZR-8445, a cyclic depsipeptide that targets the Sec61 translocon and selectively disrupts secretory and membrane protein biogenesis in a signal peptide-dependent manner. KZR-8445 potently inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in primary immune cells and is highly efficacious in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis. A cryogenic electron microscopy structure reveals that KZR-8445 occupies the fully opened Se61 lateral gate and blocks access to the lumenal plug domain. KZR-8445 binding stabilizes the lateral gate helices in a manner that traps select signal peptides in the Sec61 channel and prevents their movement into the lipid bilayer. Our results establish a framework for the structure-guided discovery of novel therapeutics that selectively modulate Sec61-mediated protein biogenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01326-1"
"nchembio","MHC-II dynamics are maintained in HLA-DR allotypes to ensure catalyzed peptide exchange","Presentation of antigenic peptides by major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) proteins determines T helper cell reactivity. The MHC-II genetic locus displays a large degree of allelic polymorphism influencing the peptide repertoire presented by the resulting MHC-II protein allotypes. During antigen processing, the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecule HLA-DM (DM) encounters these distinct allotypes and catalyzes exchange of the placeholder peptide CLIP by exploiting dynamic features of MHC-II. Here, we investigate 12 highly abundant CLIP-bound HLA-DRB1 allotypes and correlate dynamics to catalysis by DM. Despite large differences in thermodynamic stability, peptide exchange rates fall into a target range that maintains DM responsiveness. A DM-susceptible conformation is conserved in MHC-II molecules, and allosteric coupling between polymorphic sites affects dynamic states that influence DM catalysis. As exemplified for rheumatoid arthritis, we postulate that intrinsic dynamic features of peptide-MHC-II complexes contribute to the association of individual MHC-II allotypes with autoimmune disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01316-3"
"nchembio","Dissecting the conformational complexity and mechanism of a bacterial heme transporter","Iron-bound cyclic tetrapyrroles (hemes) are redox-active cofactors in bioenergetic enzymes. However, the mechanisms of heme transport and insertion into respiratory chain complexes remain unclear. Here, we used cellular, biochemical, structural and computational methods to characterize the structure and function of the heterodimeric bacterial ABC transporter CydDC. We provide multi-level evidence that CydDC is a heme transporter required for functional maturation of cytochrome bd, a pharmaceutically relevant drug target. Our systematic single-particle cryogenic-electron microscopy approach combined with atomistic molecular dynamics simulations provides detailed insight into the conformational landscape of CydDC during substrate binding and occlusion. Our simulations reveal that heme binds laterally from the membrane space to the transmembrane region of CydDC, enabled by a highly asymmetrical inward-facing CydDC conformation. During the binding process, heme propionates interact with positively charged residues on the surface and later in the substrate-binding pocket of the transporter, causing the heme orientation to rotate 180 degrees.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01314-5"
"nchembio","Structural basis for translation inhibition by the glycosylated drosocin peptide","The proline-rich antimicrobial peptide (PrAMP) drosocin is produced by Drosophila species to combat bacterial infection. Unlike many PrAMPs, drosocin is O-glycosylated at threonine 11, a post-translation modification that enhances its antimicrobial activity. Here we demonstrate that the O-glycosylation not only influences cellular uptake of the peptide but also interacts with its intracellular target, the ribosome. Cryogenic electron microscopy structures of glycosylated drosocin on the ribosome at 2.0-2.8-Å resolution reveal that the peptide interferes with translation termination by binding within the polypeptide exit tunnel and trapping RF1 on the ribosome, reminiscent of that reported for the PrAMP apidaecin. The glycosylation of drosocin enables multiple interactions with U2609 of the 23S rRNA, leading to conformational changes that break the canonical base pair with A752. Collectively, our study reveals novel molecular insights into the interaction of O-glycosylated drosocin with the ribosome, which provide a structural basis for future development of this class of antimicrobials.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01293-7"
"nchembio","Deep thermal profiling for detection of functional proteoform groups","The complexity of the functional proteome extends considerably beyond the coding genome, resulting in millions of proteoforms. Investigation of proteoforms and their functional roles is important to understand cellular physiology and its deregulation in diseases but challenging to perform systematically. Here we applied thermal proteome profiling with deep peptide coverage to detect functional proteoform groups in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines with different cytogenetic aberrations. We detected 15,846 proteoforms, capturing differently spliced, cleaved and post-translationally modified proteins expressed from 9,290 genes. We identified differential co-aggregation of proteoform pairs and established links to disease biology. Moreover, we systematically made use of measured biophysical proteoform states to find specific biomarkers of drug sensitivity. Our approach, thus, provides a powerful and unique tool for systematic detection and functional annotation of proteoform groups.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01284-8"
"nchembio","Elucidating dynamic anaerobe metabolism with HRMAS 13C NMR and genome-scale modeling","Anaerobic microbial metabolism drives critical functions within global ecosystems, host-microbiota interactions, and industrial applications, yet remains ill-defined. Here we advance a versatile approach to elaborate cellular metabolism in obligate anaerobes using the pathogen Clostridioides difficile, an amino acid and carbohydrate-fermenting Clostridia. High-resolution magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of C. difficile, grown with fermentable 13C substrates, informed dynamic flux balance analysis (dFBA) of the pathogen's genome-scale metabolism. Analyses identified dynamic recruitment of oxidative and supporting reductive pathways, with integration of high-flux amino acid and glycolytic metabolism at alanine's biosynthesis to support efficient energy generation, nitrogen handling and biomass generation. Model predictions informed an approach leveraging the sensitivity of 13C NMR spectroscopy to simultaneously track cellular carbon and nitrogen flow from [U-13C]glucose and [15N]leucine, confirming the formation of [13C,15N]alanine. Findings identify metabolic strategies used by C. difficile to support its rapid colonization and expansion in gut ecosystems.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01275-9"
"nchembio","Sniper2L is a high-fidelity Cas9 variant with high activity","Although several high-fidelity SpCas9 variants have been reported, it has been observed that this increased specificity is associated with reduced on-target activity, limiting the applications of the high-fidelity variants when efficient genome editing is required. Here, we developed an improved version of Sniper-Cas9, Sniper2L, which represents an exception to this trade-off trend as it showed higher specificity with retained high activity. We evaluated Sniper2L activities at a large number of target sequences and developed DeepSniper, a deep learning model that can predict the activity of Sniper2L. We also confirmed that Sniper2L can induce highly efficient and specific editing at a large number of target sequences when it is delivered as a ribonucleoprotein complex. Mechanically, the high specificity of Sniper2L originates from its superior ability to avoid unwinding a target DNA containing even a single mismatch. We envision that Sniper2L will be useful when efficient and specific genome editing is required.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01279-5"
"nchembio","Combinatorial protein dimerization enables precise multi-input synthetic computations","Bacterial transcription factors (TFs) with helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domains have been widely explored to build orthogonal transcriptional regulation systems in mammalian cells. Here we capitalize on the modular structure of these proteins to build a framework for multi-input logic gates relying on serial combinations of inducible protein-protein interactions. We found that for some TFs, their HTH domain alone is sufficient for DNA binding. By fusing the HTH domain to TFs, we established dimerization dependent rather than DNA-binding-dependent activation. This enabled us to convert gene switches from OFF-type into more widely applicable ON-type systems and to create mammalian gene switches responsive to new inducers. By combining both OFF and ON modes of action, we built a compact, high-performance bandpass filter. Furthermore, we were able to show cytosolic and extracellular dimerization. Cascading up to five pairwise fusion proteins yielded robust multi-input AND logic gates. Combinations of different pairwise fusion proteins afforded a variety of 4-input 1-output AND and OR logic gate configurations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01281-x"

"nchembio","Multicopy suppressor screens reveal convergent evolution of single-gene lysis proteins","Single-strand RNA (ssRNA) Fiersviridae phages cause host lysis with a product of single gene (sgl for single-gene lysis; product Sgl) that induces autolysis. Many different Sgls have been discovered, but the molecular targets of only a few have been identified. In this study, we used a high-throughput genetic screen to uncover genome-wide host suppressors of diverse Sgls. In addition to validating known molecular mechanisms, we discovered that the Sgl of PP7, an ssRNA phage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, targets MurJ, the flippase responsible for lipid II export, previously shown to be the target of the Sgl of coliphage M. These two Sgls, which are unrelated and predicted to have opposite membrane topology, thus represent a case of convergent evolution. We extended the genetic screens to other uncharacterized Sgls and uncovered a common set of multicopy suppressors, suggesting that these Sgls act by the same or similar mechanism.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01269-7"
"nchembio","Site-specific encoding of photoactivity and photoreactivity into antibody fragments","Design of biomolecules that perform two or more distinct functions in response to light remains challenging. Here, we have introduced concurrent photoactivity and photoreactivity into an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting antibody fragment, 7D12. This was achieved by site-specific incorporation of photocaged tyrosine (pcY) for photoactivity and p-benzoyl-ʟ-phenylalanine (Bpa) for photoreactivity into 7D12. We identified a position for installing Bpa in 7D12 that has minimal effect on 7D12-EGFR binding affinity in the absence of light. Upon exposure to 365-nm light, this Bpa-containing 7D12 mutant forms a covalent bond with EGFR in an antigen-specific manner. We then developed a method for site-specific incorporation of pcY and Bpa at two distinct sites in 7D12. Finally, we demonstrated that in the absence of light, this pcY- and Bpa-containing mutant of 7D12 does not bind to EGFR, but irradiation with 365-nm light activates (1) specific binding and (2) covalent bond formation with EGFR.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01251-9"
"nchembio","Structural basis of efficacy-driven ligand selectivity at GPCRs","A drug's selectivity for target receptors is essential to its therapeutic utility, but achieving selectivity between similar receptors is challenging. The serendipitous discovery of ligands that stimulate target receptors more strongly than closely related receptors, despite binding with similar affinities, suggests a solution. The molecular mechanism of such 'efficacy-driven selectivity' has remained unclear, however, hindering design of such ligands. Here, using atomic-level simulations, we reveal the structural basis for the efficacy-driven selectivity of a long-studied clinical drug candidate, xanomeline, between closely related muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). Xanomeline's binding mode is similar across mAChRs in their inactive states but differs between mAChRs in their active states, with divergent effects on active-state stability. We validate this mechanism experimentally and use it to design ligands with altered efficacy-driven selectivity. Our results suggest strategies for the rational design of ligands that achieve efficacy-driven selectivity for many pharmaceutically important G-protein-coupled receptors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01247-5"
"nchembio","An optimized bioluminescent substrate for non-invasive imaging in the brain","Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) allows non-invasive visualization of cells and biochemical events in vivo and thus has become an indispensable technique in biomedical research. However, BLI in the central nervous system remains challenging because luciferases show relatively poor performance in the brain with existing substrates. Here, we report the discovery of a NanoLuc substrate with improved brain performance, cephalofurimazine (CFz). CFz paired with Antares luciferase produces greater than 20-fold more signal from the brain than the standard combination of d-luciferin with firefly luciferase. At standard doses, Antares-CFz matches AkaLuc-AkaLumine/TokeOni in brightness, while occasional higher dosing of CFz can be performed to obtain threefold more signal. CFz should allow the growing number of NanoLuc-based indicators to be applied to the brain with high sensitivity. Using CFz, we achieve video-rate non-invasive imaging of Antares in brains of freely moving mice and demonstrate non-invasive calcium imaging of sensory-evoked activity in genetically defined neurons.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01265-x"
"nchembio","Complex regulation in a Comamonas platform for diverse aromatic carbon metabolism","Critical to a sustainable energy future are microbial platforms that can process aromatic carbons from the largely untapped reservoir of lignin and plastic feedstocks. Comamonas species present promising bacterial candidates for such platforms because they can use a range of natural and xenobiotic aromatic compounds and often possess innate genetic constraints that avoid competition with sugars. However, the metabolic reactions of these species are underexplored, and the regulatory mechanisms are unknown. Here we identify multilevel regulation in the conversion of lignin-related natural aromatic compounds, 4-hydroxybenzoate and vanillate, and the plastics-related xenobiotic aromatic compound, terephthalate, in Comamonas testosteroni KF-1. Transcription-level regulation controls initial catabolism and cleavage, but metabolite-level thermodynamic regulation governs fluxes in central carbon metabolism. Quantitative 13C mapping of tricarboxylic acid cycle and cataplerotic reactions elucidates key carbon routing not evident from enzyme abundance changes. This scheme of transcriptional activation coupled with metabolic fine-tuning challenges outcome predictions during metabolic manipulations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01237-7"
"nchembio","3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase is a protein persulfidase","Protein S-persulfidation (P-SSH) is recognized as a common posttranslational modification. It occurs under basal conditions and is often observed to be elevated under stress conditions. However, the mechanism(s) by which proteins are persulfidated inside cells have remained unclear. Here we report that 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfur transferase (MPST) engages in direct protein-to-protein transpersulfidation reactions beyond its previously known protein substrates thioredoxin and MOCS3/Uba4, associated with H2S generation and transfer RNA thiolation, respectively. We observe that depletion of MPST in human cells lowers overall intracellular protein persulfidation levels and identify a subset of proteins whose persulfidation depends on MPST. The predicted involvement of these proteins in the adaptation to stress responses supports the notion that MPST-dependent protein persulfidation promotes cytoprotective functions. The observation of MPST-independent protein persulfidation suggests that other protein persulfidases remain to be identified.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01244-8"
"nchembio","Etoposide promotes DNA loop trapping and barrier formation by topoisomerase II","Etoposide is a broadly employed chemotherapeutic and eukaryotic topoisomerase II poison that stabilizes cleaved DNA intermediates to promote DNA breakage and cytotoxicity. How etoposide perturbs topoisomerase dynamics is not known. Here we investigated the action of etoposide on yeast topoisomerase II, human topoisomerase II[alpha] and human topoisomerase II[beta] using several sensitive single-molecule detection methods. Unexpectedly, we found that etoposide induces topoisomerase to trap DNA loops, compacting DNA and restructuring DNA topology. Loop trapping occurs after ATP hydrolysis but before strand ejection from the enzyme. Although etoposide decreases the innate stability of topoisomerase dimers, it increases the ability of the enzyme to act as a stable roadblock. Interestingly, the three topoisomerases show similar etoposide-mediated resistance to dimer separation and sliding along DNA but different abilities to compact DNA and chirally relax DNA supercoils. These data provide unique mechanistic insights into the functional consequences of etoposide on topoisomerase II dynamics.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01235-9"
"nchembio","Structures of the sulfite detoxifying F420-dependent enzyme from Methanococcales","Methanogenic archaea are main actors in the carbon cycle but are sensitive to reactive sulfite. Some methanogens use a sulfite detoxification system that combines an F420H2-oxidase with a sulfite reductase, both of which are proposed precursors of modern enzymes. Here, we present snapshots of this coupled system, named coenzyme F420-dependent sulfite reductase (Group I Fsr), obtained from two marine methanogens. Fsr organizes as a homotetramer, harboring an intertwined six-[4Fe-4S] cluster relay characterized by spectroscopy. The wire, spanning 5.4 nm, electronically connects the flavin to the siroheme center. Despite a structural architecture similar to dissimilatory sulfite reductases, Fsr shows a siroheme coordination and a reaction mechanism identical to assimilatory sulfite reductases. Accordingly, the reaction of Fsr is unidirectional, reducing sulfite or nitrite with F420H2. Our results provide structural insights into this unique fusion, in which a primitive sulfite reductase turns a poison into an elementary block of life.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01232-y"
"nchembio","A structural basis for prion strain diversity","Recent cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of infectious, ex vivo, prion fibrils from hamster 263K and mouse RML prion strains revealed a similar, parallel in-register intermolecular [beta]-sheet (PIRIBS) amyloid architecture. Rungs of the fibrils are composed of individual prion protein (PrP) monomers that fold to create distinct N-terminal and C-terminal lobes. However, disparity in the hamster/mouse PrP sequence precludes understanding of how divergent prion strains emerge from an identical PrP substrate. In this study, we determined the near-atomic resolution cryo-EM structure of infectious, ex vivo mouse prion fibrils from the ME7 prion strain and compared this with the RML fibril structure. This structural comparison of two biologically distinct mouse-adapted prion strains suggests defined folding subdomains of PrP rungs and the way in which they are interrelated, providing a structural definition of intra-species prion strain-specific conformations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01229-7"
"nchembio","Macroscopic quorum sensing sustains differentiating embryonic stem cells","Cells can secrete molecules that help each other's replication. In cell cultures, chemical signals might diffuse only within a cell colony or between colonies. A chemical signal's interaction length-how far apart interacting cells are-is often assumed to be some value without rigorous justifications because molecules' invisible paths and complex multicellular geometries pose challenges. Here we present an approach, combining mathematical models and experiments, for determining a chemical signal's interaction length. With murine embryonic stem (ES) cells as a testbed, we found that differentiating ES cells secrete FGF4, among others, to communicate over many millimeters in cell culture dishes and, thereby, form a spatially extended, macroscopic entity that grows only if its centimeter-scale population density is above a threshold value. With this 'macroscopic quorum sensing', an isolated macroscopic, but not isolated microscopic, colony can survive differentiation. Our integrated approach can determine chemical signals' interaction lengths in generic multicellular communities.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01225-x"
"nchembio","Structure, sequon recognition and mechanism of tryptophan C-mannosyltransferase","C-linked glycosylation is essential for the trafficking, folding and function of secretory and transmembrane proteins involved in cellular communication processes. The tryptophan C-mannosyltransferase (CMT) enzymes that install the modification attach a mannose to the first tryptophan of WxxW/C sequons in nascent polypeptide chains by an unknown mechanism. Here, we report cryogenic-electron microscopy structures of Caenorhabditis elegans CMT in four key states: apo, acceptor peptide-bound, donor-substrate analog-bound and as a trapped ternary complex with both peptide and a donor-substrate mimic bound. The structures indicate how the C-mannosylation sequon is recognized by this CMT and its paralogs, and how sequon binding triggers conformational activation of the donor substrate: a process relevant to all glycosyltransferase C superfamily enzymes. Our structural data further indicate that the CMTs adopt an unprecedented electrophilic aromatic substitution mechanism to enable the C-glycosylation of proteins. These results afford opportunities for understanding human disease and therapeutic targeting of specific CMT paralogs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01219-9"
"nchembio","Targeted degradation via direct 26S proteasome recruitment","Engineered destruction of target proteins by recruitment to the cell's degradation machinery has emerged as a promising strategy in drug discovery. The majority of molecules that facilitate targeted degradation do so via a select number of ubiquitin ligases, restricting this therapeutic approach to tissue types that express the requisite ligase. Here, we describe a new strategy of targeted protein degradation through direct substrate recruitment to the 26S proteasome. The proteolytic complex is essential and abundantly expressed in all cells; however, proteasomal ligands remain scarce. We identify potent peptidic macrocycles that bind directly to the 26S proteasome subunit PSMD2, with a 2.5-Å-resolution cryo-electron microscopy complex structure revealing a binding site near the 26S pore. Conjugation of this macrocycle to a potent BRD4 ligand enabled generation of chimeric molecules that effectively degrade BRD4 in cells, thus demonstrating that degradation via direct proteasomal recruitment is a viable strategy for targeted protein degradation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01218-w"

However, this concept has not been applied to synthetic in vitro metabolic networks, thus far. Here we used anaplerotic strategies to directly access the core sequence of the CETCH cycle, a new-to-nature in vitro CO2-fixation pathway that features several C3-C5 biosynthetic precursors. We drafted four different anaplerotic modules that use CO2 to replenish the CETCH cycle's intermediates and validated our designs by producing 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-DEB), the C21-macrolide backbone of erythromycin. Our best design allowed the carbon-positive synthesis of 6-DEB via 54 enzymatic reactions in vitro at yields comparable to those with isolated 6-DEB polyketide synthase (DEBS). Our work showcases how new-to-nature anaplerotic modules can be designed and tailored to enhance and expand the synthetic capabilities of complex catalytic in vitro reaction networks.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01179-0"
"nchembio","Structure of SpoT reveals evolutionary tuning of catalysis via conformational constraint","Stringent factors orchestrate bacterial cell reprogramming through increasing the level of the alarmones (p)ppGpp. In Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria, SpoT hydrolyzes (p)ppGpp to counteract the synthetase activity of RelA. However, structural information about how SpoT controls the levels of (p)ppGpp is missing. Here we present the crystal structure of the hydrolase-only SpoT from Acinetobacter baumannii and uncover the mechanism of intramolecular regulation of 'long'-stringent factors. In contrast to ribosome-associated Rel/RelA that adopt an elongated structure, SpoT assumes a compact [tau]-shaped structure in which the regulatory domains wrap around a Core subdomain that controls the conformational state of the enzyme. The Core is key to the specialization of long RelA-SpoT homologs toward either synthesis or hydrolysis: the short and structured Core of SpoT stabilizes the [tau]-state priming the hydrolase domain for (p)ppGpp hydrolysis, whereas the longer, more dynamic Core domain of RelA destabilizes the [tau]-state priming the monofunctional RelA for efficient (p)ppGpp synthesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01198-x"

Here we introduce the first biosensor for measuring CoA levels in different organelles of mammalian cells. The semisynthetic biosensor is generated through the specific labeling of an engineered GFP-HaloTag fusion protein with a fluorescent ligand. Its readout is based on CoA-dependent changes in Förster resonance energy transfer efficiency between GFP and the fluorescent ligand. Using this biosensor, we probe the role of numerous proteins involved in CoA biosynthesis and transport in mammalian cells. On the basis of these studies, we propose a cellular map of CoA biosynthesis that suggests how pools of cytosolic and mitochondrial CoA are maintained.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01172-7"

Here, we show that mammalian GS uses glutamate and methylamine to produce a methylated glutamine analog, N5-methylglutamine. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that liver-specific GS deletion and its pharmacological inhibition in mice suppress hepatic and circulating levels of N5-methylglutamine. This alternative activity of GS was confirmed in human recombinant enzyme and cells, where a pathogenic mutation in the active site (R324C) promoted the synthesis of N5-methylglutamine over glutamine. N5-methylglutamine is detected in the circulation, and its levels are sustained by the microbiome, as demonstrated by using germ-free mice. Finally, we show that urine levels of N5-methylglutamine correlate with tumor burden and GS expression in a [beta]-catenin-driven model of liver cancer, highlighting the translational potential of this uncharacterized metabolite.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01154-9"
"nchembio","A fluorescent multi-domain protein reveals the unfolding mechanism of Hsp70","Detailed understanding of the mechanism by which Hsp70 chaperones protect cells against protein aggregation is hampered by the lack of a comprehensive characterization of the aggregates, which are typically heterogeneous. Here we designed a reporter chaperone substrate, MLucV, composed of a stress-labile luciferase flanked by stress-resistant fluorescent domains, which upon denaturation formed a discrete population of small aggregates. Combining Förster resonance energy transfer and enzymatic activity measurements provided unprecedented details on the aggregated, unfolded, Hsp70-bound and native MLucV conformations. The Hsp70 mechanism first involved ATP-fueled disaggregation and unfolding of the stable pre-aggregated substrate, which stretched MLucV beyond simply unfolded conformations, followed by native refolding. The ATP-fueled unfolding and refolding action of Hsp70 on MLucV aggregates could accumulate native MLucV species under elevated denaturing temperatures highly adverse to the native state. These results unambiguously exclude binding and preventing of aggregation from the non-equilibrium mechanism by which Hsp70 converts stable aggregates into metastable native proteins.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01162-9"
"nchembio","Nitric oxide-driven modifications of lipoic arm inhibit [alpha]-ketoacid dehydrogenases","Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC), which belong to the mitochondrial [alpha]-ketoacid dehydrogenase family, play crucial roles in cellular metabolism. These multi-subunit enzyme complexes use lipoic arms covalently attached to their E2 subunits to transfer an acyl group to coenzyme A (CoA). Here, we report a novel mechanism capable of substantially inhibiting PDHC and OGDC: reactive nitrogen species (RNS) can covalently modify the thiols on their lipoic arms, generating a series of adducts that block catalytic activity. S-Nitroso-CoA, a product between RNS and the E2 subunit's natural substrate, CoA, can efficiently deliver these modifications onto the lipoic arm. We found RNS-mediated inhibition of PDHC and OGDC occurs during classical macrophage activation, driving significant rewiring of cellular metabolism over time. This work provides a new mechanistic link between RNS and mitochondrial metabolism with potential relevance for numerous physiological and pathological conditions in which RNS accumulate.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01153-w"
"nchembio","Structural basis of colibactin activation by the ClbP peptidase","Colibactin, a DNA cross-linking agent produced by gut bacteria, is implicated in colorectal cancer. Its biosynthesis uses a prodrug resistance mechanism: a non-toxic precursor assembled in the cytoplasm is activated after export to the periplasm. This activation is mediated by ClbP, an inner-membrane peptidase with an N-terminal periplasmic catalytic domain and a C-terminal three-helix transmembrane domain. Although the transmembrane domain is required for colibactin activation, its role in catalysis is unclear. Our structure of full-length ClbP bound to a product analog reveals an interdomain interface important for substrate binding and enzyme stability and interactions that explain the selectivity of ClbP for the N-acyl-d-asparagine prodrug motif. Based on structural and biochemical evidence, we propose that ClbP dimerizes to form an extended substrate-binding site that can accommodate a pseudodimeric precolibactin with its two terminal prodrug motifs in the two ClbP active sites, thus enabling the coordinated activation of both electrophilic warheads.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01142-z"

Understanding colibactin's biological effects remains difficult owing to the instability of the proposed active species and the complexity of the gut microbiota. Here, we report small molecule boronic acid inhibitors of colibactin biosynthesis. Designed to mimic the biosynthetic precursor precolibactin, these compounds potently inhibit the colibactin-activating peptidase ClbP. Using biochemical assays and crystallography, we show that they engage the ClbP binding pocket, forming a covalent bond with the catalytic serine. These inhibitors reproduce the phenotypes observed in a clbP deletion mutant and block the genotoxic effects of colibactin on eukaryotic cells. The availability of ClbP inhibitors will allow precise, temporal control over colibactin production, enabling further study of its contributions to CRC. Finally, application of our inhibitors to related peptidase-encoding pathways highlights the power of chemical tools to probe natural product biosynthesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01147-8"
"nchembio","Discovery and molecular basis of subtype-selective cyclophilin inhibitors","Although cyclophilins are attractive targets for probing biology and therapeutic intervention, no subtype-selective cyclophilin inhibitors have been described. We discovered novel cyclophilin inhibitors from the in vitro selection of a DNA-templated library of 256,000 drug-like macrocycles for cyclophilin D (CypD) affinity. Iterated macrocycle engineering guided by ten X-ray co-crystal structures yielded potent and selective inhibitors (half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 10 nM) that bind the active site of CypD and also make novel interactions with non-conserved residues in the S2 pocket, an adjacent exo-site. The resulting macrocycles inhibit CypD activity with 21- to >10,000-fold selectivity over other cyclophilins and inhibit mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening in isolated mitochondria. We further exploited S2 pocket interactions to develop the first cyclophilin E (CypE)-selective inhibitor, which forms a reversible covalent bond with a CypE S2 pocket lysine, and exhibits 30- to >4,000-fold selectivity over other cyclophilins. These findings reveal a strategy to generate isoform-selective small-molecule cyclophilin modulators, advancing their suitability as targets for biological investigation and therapeutic development.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01116-1"
"nchembio","Spatiotemporally controlled generation of NTPs for single-molecule studies","Many essential processes in the cell depend on proteins that use nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs). Methods that directly monitor the often-complex dynamics of these proteins at the single-molecule level have helped to uncover their mechanisms of action. However, the measurement throughput is typically limited for NTP-utilizing reactions, and the quantitative dissection of complex dynamics over multiple sequential turnovers remains challenging. Here we present a method for controlling NTP-driven reactions in single-molecule experiments via the local generation of NTPs (LAGOON) that markedly increases the measurement throughput and enables single-turnover observations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAGOON in single-molecule fluorescence and force spectroscopy assays by monitoring DNA unwinding, nucleosome sliding and RNA polymerase elongation. LAGOON can be readily integrated with many single-molecule techniques, and we anticipate that it will facilitate studies of a wide range of crucial NTP-driven processes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01100-9"
"nchembio","Hydropersulfides inhibit lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis by scavenging radicals","Ferroptosis is a type of cell death caused by radical-driven lipid peroxidation, leading to membrane damage and rupture. Here we show that enzymatically produced sulfane sulfur (S0) species, specifically hydropersulfides, scavenge endogenously generated free radicals and, thereby, suppress lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. By providing sulfur for S0 biosynthesis, cysteine can support ferroptosis resistance independently of the canonical GPX4 pathway. Our results further suggest that hydropersulfides terminate radical chain reactions through the formation and self-recombination of perthiyl radicals. The autocatalytic regeneration of hydropersulfides may explain why low micromolar concentrations of persulfides suffice to produce potent cytoprotective effects on a background of millimolar concentrations of glutathione. We propose that increased S0 biosynthesis is an adaptive cellular response to radical-driven lipid peroxidation, potentially representing a primordial radical protection system.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01145-w"

Herein we report the development and characterization of PhosphatidylInositol Three-kinase Class twO INhibitors (PITCOINs), potent and highly selective small-molecule inhibitors of PI3KC2[alpha] catalytic activity. PITCOIN compounds exhibit strong selectivity toward PI3KC2[alpha] due to their unique mode of interaction with the ATP-binding site of the enzyme. We demonstrate that acute inhibition of PI3KC2[alpha]-mediated synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphates by PITCOINs impairs endocytic membrane dynamics and membrane remodeling during platelet-dependent thrombus formation. PITCOINs are potent and selective cell-permeable inhibitors of PI3KC2[alpha] function with potential biomedical applications ranging from thrombosis to diabetes and cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01118-z"
"nchembio","﻿An RNA aptamer that shifts the reduction potential of metabolic cofactors","The discovery of ribozymes has inspired exploration of RNA's potential to serve as primordial catalysts in a hypothesized RNA world. Modern oxidoreductase enzymes employ differential binding between reduced and oxidized forms of redox cofactors to alter cofactor reduction potential and enhance the enzyme's catalytic capabilities. The utility of differential affinity has been underexplored as a chemical strategy for RNA. Here we show an RNA aptamer that preferentially binds oxidized forms of flavin over reduced forms and markedly shifts flavin reduction potential by −40 mV, similar to shifts for oxidoreductases. Nuclear magnetic resonance structural analysis revealed [pi]-[pi] and donor atom-[pi] interactions between the aptamer and flavin that cause unfavorable contacts with the electron-rich reduced form, suggesting a mechanism by which the local environment of the RNA-binding pocket drives the observed shift in cofactor reduction potential. It seems likely that primordial RNAs could have used similar strategies in RNA world metabolisms.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01121-4"

These mostly ineffective antibodies target variable epitopes. Here we describe broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors developed by tethering the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), to known non-neutralizing antibodies that target highly conserved epitopes in the viral spike protein. These inhibitors, called receptor-blocking conserved non-neutralizing antibodies (ReconnAbs), potently neutralize all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), including Omicron. Neutralization potency is lost when the linker joining the binding and inhibitory ReconnAb components is severed. In addition, a bi-functional ReconnAb, made by linking ACE2 to a bi-specific antibody targeting two non-overlapping conserved epitopes, defined here, shows sub-nanomolar neutralizing activity against all VOCs, including Omicron and BA.2. Given their conserved targets and modular nature, ReconnAbs have the potential to act as broad-spectrum therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging pandemic diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01140-1"
"nchembio","Observation of conformational changes that underlie the catalytic cycle of Xrn2","Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods that quantitatively probe motions on molecular and atomic levels have propelled the understanding of biomolecular processes for which static structures cannot provide a satisfactory description. In this work, we studied the structure and dynamics of the essential 100-kDa eukaryotic 5'->3' exoribonuclease Xrn2. A combination of complementary fluorine and methyl-TROSY NMR spectroscopy reveals that the apo enzyme is highly dynamic around the catalytic center. These observed dynamics are in agreement with a transition of the enzyme from the ground state into a catalytically competent state. We show that the conformational equilibrium in Xrn2 shifts substantially toward the active state in the presence of substrate and magnesium. Finally, our data reveal that the dynamics in Xrn2 correlate with the RNA degradation rate, as a mutation that attenuates motions also affects catalytic activity. In that light, our results stress the importance of studies that go beyond static structural information.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01111-6"

Here we present an integrated target-to-receptor pipeline for constructing a customizable advanced modular bispecific extracellular receptor (AMBER) that combines our generalized extracellular molecule sensor (GEMS) system with a high-throughput platform for generating designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins). For proof of concept, we chose human fibrin degradation products (FDPs) as markers with high clinical relevance and screened a DARPin library for FDP binders. We built AMBERs equipped with 19 different DARPins selected from 160 hits, and found 4 of them to be functional as heterodimers with a known single-chain variable fragments binder. Tandem receptors consisting of combinations of the validated DARPins are also functional. We demonstrate applications of these AMBER receptors in vitro and in vivo by constructing designer cell lines that detect pathological concentrations of FDPs and respond with the production of a reporter and a therapeutic anti-thrombotic protein.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01095-3"
"nchembio","Na+ riboswitches regulate genes for diverse physiological processes in bacteria","Organisms presumably have mechanisms to monitor and physiologically adapt to changes in cellular Na+ concentrations. Only a single bacterial protein has previously been demonstrated to selectively sense Na+ and regulate gene expression. Here we report a riboswitch class, previously called the 'DUF1646 motif', whose members selectively sense Na+ and regulate the expression of genes relevant to sodium biology. Many proteins encoded by Na+-riboswitch-regulated genes are annotated as metal ion transporters, whereas others are involved in mitigating osmotic stress or harnessing Na+ gradients for ATP production. Na+ riboswitches exhibit dissociation constants in the low mM range, and strongly reject all other alkali and alkaline earth ions. Likewise, only Na+ triggers riboswitch-mediated transcription and gene expression changes. These findings reveal that some bacteria use Na+ riboswitches to monitor, adjust and exploit Na+ concentrations and gradients, and in some instances collaborate with c-di-AMP riboswitches to coordinate gene expression during osmotic stress.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01086-4"

Here, we combine solubility proteome profiling with phosphoproteomics to quantitatively map several hundred phosphosites enriched in either soluble or condensate-bound protein subpopulations, including a subset of phosphosites modulating protein-RNA interactions. We show that multi-phosphorylation of the C-terminal disordered segment of heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (HNRNPA1), a key RNA-splicing factor, reduces its ability to locate to nuclear clusters. For nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), an essential nucleolar protein, we show that phosphorylation of S254 and S260 is crucial for lowering its partitioning to the nucleolus and additional phosphorylation of distal sites enhances its retention in the nucleoplasm. These phosphorylation events decrease RNA and protein interactions of NPM1 to regulate its condensation. Our dataset is a rich resource for systematically uncovering the phosphoregulation of biomolecular condensates.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01062-y"

The recently approved mutant selective small-molecule cysteine-reactive covalent inhibitor of the G12C mutant of K-Ras, sotorasib, provides a case in point. KRAS is the most frequently mutated proto-oncogene in human cancer, yet despite success targeting the G12C allele, targeted therapy for other hotspot mutants of KRAS has not been described. Here we report the discovery of small molecules that covalently target a G12S somatic mutation in K-Ras and suppress its oncogenic signaling. We show that these molecules are active in cells expressing K-Ras(G12S) but spare the wild-type protein. Our results provide a path to targeting a second somatic mutation in the oncogene KRAS by overcoming the weak nucleophilicity of an acquired serine residue.

Here we used single-molecule magnetic tweezers, gel-based assays and nanopore sequencing to explore DNA unwinding and cleavage. In addition to dynamic and heterogenous R-loop formation, we also directly observed transient double-stranded DNA unwinding downstream of the 20-bp heteroduplex and, following NTS cleavage, formation of a hyperstable 'clamped' Cas12a-DNA intermediate necessary for TS cleavage. Annealing of a 4-nucleotide 3' CRISPR RNA overhang to the unwound TS downstream of the heteroduplex inhibited clamping and slowed TS cleavage by ~16-fold. Alanine substitution of a conserved aromatic amino acid in the REC2 subdomain that normally caps the R-loop relieved this inhibition but favoured stabilisation of unwound states, suggesting that the REC2 subdomain regulates access of the 3' CRISPR RNA to downstream DNA.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01082-8"

This raises the intriguing question of how these biosynthetic pathways have evolved. Sea star saponins are steroidal, while those of the sea cucumber are triterpenoid. Sterol biosynthesis in animals involves cyclization of 2,3-oxidosqualene to lanosterol by the oxidosqualene cyclase (OSC) enzyme lanosterol synthase (LSS). Here we show that sea cucumbers lack LSS and instead have two divergent OSCs that produce triterpene saponins and that are likely to have evolved from an ancestral LSS by gene duplication and neofunctionalization. We further show that sea cucumbers make alternate sterols that confer protection against self-poisoning by their own saponins. Collectively, these events have enabled sea cucumbers to evolve the ability to produce saponins and saponin-resistant sterols concomitantly.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01054-y"

We previously identified the small molecule CID661578 as a potent inducer of [beta]-cell regeneration, but its target and mechanism of action have remained unknown. We now screened 257 million yeast clones and determined that CID661578 targets MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (MNK2), an interaction we genetically validated in vivo. CID661578 increased [beta]-cell neogenesis from ductal cells in zebrafish, neonatal pig islet aggregates and human pancreatic ductal organoids. Mechanistically, we found that CID661578 boosts protein synthesis and regeneration by blocking MNK2 from binding eIF4G in the translation initiation complex at the mRNA cap. Unexpectedly, this blocking activity augmented eIF4E phosphorylation depending on MNK1 and bolstered the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G, which is necessary for both hypertranslation and [beta]-cell regeneration. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a targetable role of MNK2-controlled translation in [beta]-cell regeneration, a role that warrants further investigation in diabetes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01047-x"

WH8102 as a model we show that its zinc-sensor protein Zur differs from all other known bacterial Zur proteins in overall structure and the location of its sensory zinc site. Uniquely, Synechococcus Zur activates metallothionein gene expression, which supports cellular zinc quotas spanning two orders of magnitude. Thus, a single zinc sensor facilitates growth across pico- to micromolar zinc concentrations with the bonus of banking this precious resource. The resultant ability to grow well at both ultra-low and excess zinc, together with overall lower zinc requirements, likely contribute to the broad ecological distribution of Synechococcus across the global oceans.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01051-1"

Here, we demonstrate a strategy for designing dimeric helix-hairpin motifs from a previously reported three-helix-bundle miniprotein that targets the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Through truncation of the third helix and optimization of the interhelical loop residues of the miniprotein, we developed a thermostable dimeric helix-hairpin. The dimeric four-helix bundle competes with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in binding to RBD with 2:2 stoichiometry. Cryogenic-electron microscopy revealed the formation of dimeric spike ectodomain trimer by the four-helix bundle, where all the three RBDs from either spike protein are attached head-to-head in an open conformation, revealing a novel mechanism for virus neutralization. The proteomimetic protects hamsters from high dose viral challenge with replicative SARS-CoV-2 viruses, demonstrating the promise of this class of peptides that inhibit protein-protein interaction through target dimerization.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01060-0"

Pathway analysis of TNBC cell lines indicates that the activation of interferon responses before and after MS023 treatment is a functional biomarker and determinant of response, and these observations extend to a panel of human-derived organoids. Inhibition of type I PRMT triggers an interferon response through the antiviral defense pathway with the induction of double-stranded RNA, which is derived, at least in part, from inverted repeat Alu elements. Together, our results represent a shift in understanding the antitumor mechanism of type I PRMT inhibitors and provide a rationale and biomarker approach for the clinical development of type I PRMT inhibitors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-01024-4"

Nevertheless, many oncogenic KRAS mutants lack these two features, and it remains unknown whether targeting the SII-P is a practical therapeutic approach for KRAS mutants beyond G12C. Here we use NMR spectroscopy and a cellular KRAS engagement assay to address this question by examining a collection of SII-P ligands from the literature and from our own laboratory. We show that the SII-Ps of many KRAS hotspot (G12, G13, Q61) mutants are accessible using noncovalent ligands, and that this accessibility is not necessarily coupled to the GDP state of KRAS. The results we describe here emphasize the SII-P as a privileged drug-binding site on KRAS and unveil new therapeutic opportunities in RAS-driven cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-022-00985-w"

We have solved the crystal structure of this ribozyme at a resolution of 2.3 Å, showing how the RNA folds to generate a very specific binding site for the methyl donor substrate. The structure immediately suggests a catalytic mechanism involving a combination of proximity and orientation and nucleobase-mediated general acid catalysis.

"nchembio","Widespread occurrence of covalent lysine-cysteine redox switches in proteins","We recently reported the discovery of a lysine-cysteine redox switch in proteins with a covalent nitrogen-oxygen-sulfur (NOS) bridge. Here, a systematic survey of the whole protein structure database discloses that NOS bridges are ubiquitous redox switches in proteins of all domains of life and are found in diverse structural motifs and chemical variants. In several instances, lysines are observed in simultaneous linkage with two cysteines, forming a sulfur-oxygen-nitrogen-oxygen-sulfur (SONOS) bridge with a trivalent nitrogen, which constitutes an unusual native branching cross-link. In many proteins, the NOS switch contains a functionally essential lysine with direct roles in enzyme catalysis or binding of substrates, DNA or effectors, linking lysine chemistry and redox biology as a regulatory principle. NOS/SONOS switches are frequently found in proteins from human and plant pathogens, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and also in many human proteins with established roles in gene expression, redox signaling and homeostasis in physiological and pathophysiological conditions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-021-00966-5"
"nchembio","Engineered ACE2 decoy mitigates lung injury and death induced by SARS-CoV-2 variants","Vaccine hesitancy and emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) escaping vaccine-induced immune responses highlight the urgency for new COVID-19 therapeutics. Engineered angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins with augmented binding affinities for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein may prove to be especially efficacious against multiple variants. Using molecular dynamics simulations and functional assays, we show that three amino acid substitutions in an engineered soluble ACE2 protein markedly augmented the affinity for the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 isolate and multiple VOCs: B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). In humanized K18-hACE2 mice infected with the SARS-CoV-2 WA-1/2020 or P.1 variant, prophylactic and therapeutic injections of soluble ACE22.v2.4-IgG1 prevented lung vascular injury and edema formation, essential features of CoV-2-induced SARS, and above all improved survival. These studies demonstrate broad efficacy in vivo of an engineered ACE2 decoy against SARS-CoV-2 variants in mice and point to its therapeutic potential.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-021-00965-6"
"nchembio","Structure of UBE2K-Ub/E3/polyUb reveals mechanisms of K48-linked Ub chain extension","Ubiquitin (Ub) chain types govern distinct biological processes. K48-linked polyUb chains target substrates for proteasomal degradation, but the mechanism of Ub chain synthesis remains elusive due to the transient nature of Ub handover. Here, we present the structure of a chemically trapped complex of the E2 UBE2K covalently linked to donor Ub and acceptor K48-linked di-Ub, primed for K48-linked Ub chain synthesis by a RING E3. The structure reveals the basis for acceptor Ub recognition by UBE2K active site residues and the C-terminal Ub-associated (UBA) domain, to impart K48-linked Ub specificity and catalysis. Furthermore, the structure unveils multiple Ub-binding surfaces on the UBA domain that allow distinct binding modes for K48- and K63-linked Ub chains. This multivalent Ub-binding feature serves to recruit UBE2K to ubiquitinated substrates to overcome weak acceptor Ub affinity and thereby promote chain elongation. These findings elucidate the mechanism of processive K48-linked polyUb chain formation by UBE2K.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-021-00952-x"
"nchembio","Identification and mechanism of G protein-biased ligands for chemokine receptor CCR1","Biased signaling of G protein-coupled receptors describes an ability of different ligands that preferentially activate an alternative downstream signaling pathway. In this work, we identified and characterized different N-terminal truncations of endogenous chemokine CCL15 as balanced or biased agonists targeting CCR1, and presented three cryogenic-electron microscopy structures of the CCR1-Gi complex in the ligand-free form or bound to different CCL15 truncations with a resolution of 2.6-2.9 Å, illustrating the structural basis of natural biased signaling that initiates an inflammation response. Complemented with pharmacological and computational studies, these structures revealed it was the conformational change of Tyr291 (Y2917.43) in CCR1 that triggered its polar network rearrangement in the orthosteric binding pocket and allosterically regulated the activation of [beta]-arrestin signaling. Our structure of CCL15-bound CCR1 also exhibited a critical site for ligand binding distinct from many other chemokine-receptor complexes, providing new insights into the mode of chemokine recognition.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-021-00918-z"
"nchembio","Mandipropamid as a chemical inducer of proximity for in vivo applications","Direct control of protein interactions by chemically induced protein proximity holds great potential for both cell and synthetic biology as well as therapeutic applications. Low toxicity, orthogonality and excellent cell permeability are important criteria for chemical inducers of proximity (CIPs), in particular for in vivo applications. Here, we present the use of the agrochemical mandipropamid (Mandi) as a highly efficient CIP in cell culture systems and living organisms. Mandi specifically induces complex formation between a sixfold mutant of the plant hormone receptor pyrabactin resistance 1 (PYR1) and abscisic acid insensitive (ABI). It is orthogonal to other plant hormone-based CIPs and rapamycin-based CIP systems. We demonstrate the applicability of the Mandi system for rapid and efficient protein translocation in mammalian cells and zebrafish embryos, protein network shuttling and manipulation of endogenous proteins.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-021-00922-3"

"nchembio","Post-translational insertion of boron in proteins to probe and modulate function","Boron is absent in proteins, yet is a micronutrient. It possesses unique bonding that could expand biological function including modes of Lewis acidity not available to typical elements of life. Here we show that post-translational C[beta]-B[gamma] bond formation provides mild, direct, site-selective access to the minimally sized residue boronoalanine (Bal) in proteins. Precise anchoring of boron within complex biomolecular systems allows dative bond-mediated, site-dependent protein Lewis acid-base-pairing (LABP) by Bal. Dynamic protein-LABP creates tunable inter- and intramolecular ligand-host interactions, while reactive protein-LABP reveals reactively accessible sites through migratory boron-to-oxygen C[beta]-O[gamma] covalent bond formation. These modes of dative bonding can also generate de novo function, such as control of thermo- and proteolytic stability in a target protein, or observation of transient structural features via chemical exchange. These results indicate that controlled insertion of boron facilitates stability modulation, structure determination, de novo binding activities and redox-responsive 'mutation'.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-021-00883-7"
"nchembio","Ligand recognition and G-protein coupling selectivity of cholecystokinin A receptor","Cholecystokinin A receptor (CCKAR) belongs to family A G-protein-coupled receptors and regulates nutrient homeostasis upon stimulation by cholecystokinin (CCK). It is an attractive drug target for gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases. One distinguishing feature of CCKAR is its ability to interact with a sulfated ligand and to couple with divergent G-protein subtypes, including Gs, Gi and Gq. However, the basis for G-protein coupling promiscuity and ligand recognition by CCKAR remains unknown. Here, we present three cryo-electron microscopy structures of sulfated CCK-8-activated CCKAR in complex with Gs, Gi and Gq heterotrimers, respectively. CCKAR presents a similar conformation in the three structures, whereas conformational differences in the 'wavy hook' of the G[alpha] subunits and ICL3 of the receptor serve as determinants in G-protein coupling selectivity. Our findings provide a framework for understanding G-protein coupling promiscuity by CCKAR and uncover the mechanism of receptor recognition by sulfated CCK-8.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-021-00841-3"
"nchembio","CUL5-ARIH2 E3-E3 ubiquitin ligase structure reveals cullin-specific NEDD8 activation","An emerging mechanism of ubiquitylation involves partnering of two distinct E3 ligases. In the best-characterized E3-E3 pathways, ARIH-family RING-between-RING (RBR) E3s ligate ubiquitin to substrates of neddylated cullin-RING E3s. The E3 ARIH2 has been implicated in ubiquitylation of substrates of neddylated CUL5-RBX2-based E3s, including APOBEC3-family substrates of the host E3 hijacked by HIV-1 virion infectivity factor (Vif). However, the structural mechanisms remained elusive. Here structural and biochemical analyses reveal distinctive ARIH2 autoinhibition, and activation on assembly with neddylated CUL5-RBX2. Comparison to structures of E3-E3 assemblies comprising ARIH1 and neddylated CUL1-RBX1-based E3s shows cullin-specific regulation by NEDD8. Whereas CUL1-linked NEDD8 directly recruits ARIH1, CUL5-linked NEDD8 does not bind ARIH2. Instead, the data reveal an allosteric mechanism. NEDD8 uniquely contacts covalently linked CUL5, and elicits structural rearrangements that unveil cryptic ARIH2-binding sites. The data reveal how a ubiquitin-like protein induces protein-protein interactions indirectly, through allostery. Allosteric specificity of ubiquitin-like protein modifications may offer opportunities for therapeutic targeting.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-021-00858-8"
