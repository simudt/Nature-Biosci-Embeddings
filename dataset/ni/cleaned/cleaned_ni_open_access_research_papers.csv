"ni","Neoantigen-specific stem cell memory-like CD4+ T cells mediate CD8+ T cell-dependent immunotherapy of MHC class II-negative solid tumors","CD4+ T cells play key roles in a range of immune responses, either as direct effectors or through accessory cells, including CD8+ T lymphocytes. In cancer, neoantigen (NeoAg)-specific CD8+ T cells capable of direct tumor recognition have been extensively studied, whereas the role of NeoAg-specific CD4+ T cells is less well understood. We have characterized the murine CD4+ T cell response against a validated NeoAg (CLTCH129>Q) expressed by the MHC-II-deficient squamous cell carcinoma tumor model (SCC VII) at the level of single T cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes and in the setting of adoptive immunotherapy. We find that the natural CLTCH129>Q-specific repertoire is diverse and contains TCRs with distinct avidities as measured by tetramer-binding assays and CD4 dependence. Despite these differences, CD4+ T cells expressing high or moderate avidity TCRs undergo comparable in vivo proliferation to cross-presented antigen from growing tumors and drive similar levels of therapeutic immunity that is dependent on CD8+ T cells and CD40L signaling. Adoptive cellular therapy (ACT) with NeoAg-specific CD4+ T cells is most effective when TCR-engineered cells are differentiated ex vivo with IL-7 and IL-15 rather than IL-2 and this was associated with both increased expansion as well as the acquisition and stable maintenance of a T stem cell memory (TSCM)-like phenotype in tumor-draining lymph nodes (tdLNs). ACT with TSCM-like CD4+ T cells results in lower PD-1 expression by CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment and an increased frequency of PD-1+CD8+ T cells in tdLNs. These findings illuminate the role of NeoAg-specific CD4+ T cells in mediating antitumor immunity via providing help to CD8+ T cells and highlight their therapeutic potential in ACT.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01543-9"
"ni","Lactation-associated macrophages exist in murine mammary tissue and human milk","Macrophages are involved in immune defense, organogenesis and tissue homeostasis. Macrophages contribute to the different phases of mammary gland remodeling during development, pregnancy and involution postlactation. Less is known about the dynamics of mammary gland macrophages in the lactation stage. Here, we describe a macrophage population present during lactation in mice. By multiparameter flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a lactation-induced CD11c+CX3CR1+Dectin-1+ macrophage population (liMac) that was distinct from the two resident F4/80hi and F4/80lo macrophage subsets present pregestationally. LiMacs were predominantly monocyte-derived and expanded by proliferation in situ concomitant with nursing. LiMacs developed independently of IL-34, but required CSF-1 signaling and were partly microbiota-dependent. Locally, they resided adjacent to the basal cells of the alveoli and extravasated into the milk. We found several macrophage subsets in human milk that resembled liMacs. Collectively, these findings reveal the emergence of unique macrophages in the mammary gland and milk during lactation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01530-0"
"ni","SALL1 enforces microglia-specific DNA binding and function of SMADs to establish microglia identity","Spalt-like transcription factor 1 (SALL1) is a critical regulator of organogenesis and microglia identity. Here we demonstrate that disruption of a conserved microglia-specific super-enhancer interacting with the Sall1 promoter results in complete and specific loss of Sall1 expression in microglia. By determining the genomic binding sites of SALL1 and leveraging Sall1 enhancer knockout mice, we provide evidence for functional interactions between SALL1 and SMAD4 required for microglia-specific gene expression. SMAD4 binds directly to the Sall1 super-enhancer and is required for Sall1 expression, consistent with an evolutionarily conserved requirement of the TGF[beta] and SMAD homologs Dpp and Mad for cell-specific expression of Spalt in the Drosophila wing. Unexpectedly, SALL1 in turn promotes binding and function of SMAD4 at microglia-specific enhancers while simultaneously suppressing binding of SMAD4 to enhancers of genes that become inappropriately activated in enhancer knockout microglia, thereby enforcing microglia-specific functions of the TGF[beta]-SMAD signaling axis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01528-8"
"ni","ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine-induced Fc receptor binding tracks with differential susceptibility to COVID-19","Despite the success of COVID-19 vaccines, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern have emerged that can cause breakthrough infections. Although protection against severe disease has been largely preserved, the immunological mediators of protection in humans remain undefined. We performed a substudy on the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccinees enrolled in a South African clinical trial. At peak immunogenicity, before infection, no differences were observed in immunoglobulin (Ig)G1-binding antibody titers; however, the vaccine induced different Fc-receptor-binding antibodies across groups. Vaccinees who resisted COVID-19 exclusively mounted Fc[gamma]R3B-binding antibodies. In contrast, enhanced IgA and IgG3, linked to enriched Fc[gamma]R2B binding, was observed in individuals who experienced breakthrough. Antibodies unable to bind to Fc[gamma]R3B led to immune complex clearance and resulted in inflammatory cascades. Differential antibody binding to Fc[gamma]R3B was linked to Fc-glycosylation differences in SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. These data potentially point to specific Fc[gamma]R3B-mediated antibody functional profiles as critical markers of immunity against COVID-19.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01513-1"
"ni","Defining blood-induced microglia functions in neurodegeneration through multiomic profiling","Blood protein extravasation through a disrupted blood-brain barrier and innate immune activation are hallmarks of neurological diseases and emerging therapeutic targets. However, how blood proteins polarize innate immune cells remains largely unknown. Here, we established an unbiased blood-innate immunity multiomic and genetic loss-of-function pipeline to define the transcriptome and global phosphoproteome of blood-induced innate immune polarization and its role in microglia neurotoxicity. Blood induced widespread microglial transcriptional changes, including changes involving oxidative stress and neurodegenerative genes. Comparative functional multiomics showed that blood proteins induce distinct receptor-mediated transcriptional programs in microglia and macrophages, such as redox, type I interferon and lymphocyte recruitment. Deletion of the blood coagulation factor fibrinogen largely reversed blood-induced microglia neurodegenerative signatures. Genetic elimination of the fibrinogen-binding motif to CD11b in Alzheimer's disease mice reduced microglial lipid metabolism and neurodegenerative signatures that were shared with autoimmune-driven neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis mice. Our data provide an interactive resource for investigation of the immunology of blood proteins that could support therapeutic targeting of microglia activation by immune and vascular signals.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01522-0"
"ni","Drivers of heterogeneity in synovial fibroblasts in rheumatoid arthritis","Inflammation of non-barrier immunologically quiescent tissues is associated with a massive influx of blood-borne innate and adaptive immune cells. Cues from the latter are likely to alter and expand activated states of the resident cells. However, local communications between immigrant and resident cell types in human inflammatory disease remain poorly understood. Here, we explored drivers of fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) heterogeneity in inflamed joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis using paired single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing, multiplexed imaging and spatial transcriptomics along with in vitro modeling of cell-extrinsic factor signaling. These analyses suggest that local exposures to myeloid and T cell-derived cytokines, TNF, IFN-[gamma], IL-1[beta] or lack thereof, drive four distinct FLS states some of which closely resemble fibroblast states in other disease-affected tissues including skin and colon. Our results highlight a role for concurrent, spatially distributed cytokine signaling within the inflamed synovium.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01527-9"
"ni","Robust and prototypical immune responses toward COVID-19 vaccine in First Nations peoples are impacted by comorbidities","High-risk groups, including Indigenous people, are at risk of severe COVID-19. Here we found that Australian First Nations peoples elicit effective immune responses to COVID-19 BNT162b2 vaccination, including neutralizing antibodies, receptor-binding domain (RBD) antibodies, SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific B cells, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In First Nations participants, RBD IgG antibody titers were correlated with body mass index and negatively correlated with age. Reduced RBD antibodies, spike-specific B cells and follicular helper T cells were found in vaccinated participants with chronic conditions (diabetes, renal disease) and were strongly associated with altered glycosylation of IgG and increased interleukin-18 levels in the plasma. These immune perturbations were also found in non-Indigenous people with comorbidities, indicating that they were related to comorbidities rather than ethnicity. However, our study is of a great importance to First Nations peoples who have disproportionate rates of chronic comorbidities and provides evidence of robust immune responses after COVID-19 vaccination in Indigenous people.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01508-y"
"ni","Spatial dysregulation of T follicular helper cells impairs vaccine responses in aging","The magnitude and quality of the germinal center (GC) response decline with age, resulting in poor vaccine-induced immunity in older individuals. A functional GC requires the co-ordination of multiple cell types across time and space, in particular across its two functionally distinct compartments: the light and dark zones. In aged mice, there is CXCR4-mediated mislocalization of T follicular helper (TFH) cells to the dark zone and a compressed network of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in the light zone. Here we show that TFH cell localization is critical for the quality of the antibody response and for the expansion of the FDC network upon immunization. The smaller GC and compressed FDC network in aged mice were corrected by provision of TFH cells that colocalize with FDCs using CXCR5. This demonstrates that the age-dependent defects in the GC response are reversible and shows that TFH cells support stromal cell responses to vaccines.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01519-9"
"ni","PI16+ reticular cells in human palatine tonsils govern T cell activity in distinct subepithelial niches","Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) direct the interaction and activation of immune cells in discrete microenvironments of lymphoid organs. Despite their important role in steering innate and adaptive immunity, the age- and inflammation-associated changes in the molecular identity and functional properties of human FRCs have remained largely unknown. Here, we show that human tonsillar FRCs undergo dynamic reprogramming during life and respond vigorously to inflammatory perturbation in comparison to other stromal cell types. The peptidase inhibitor 16 (PI16)-expressing reticular cell (PI16+ RC) subset of adult tonsils exhibited the strongest inflammation-associated structural remodeling. Interactome analysis combined with ex vivo and in vitro validation revealed that T cell activity within subepithelial niches is controlled by distinct molecular pathways during PI16+ RC-lymphocyte interaction. In sum, the topological and molecular definition of the human tonsillar stromal cell landscape reveals PI16+ RCs as a specialized FRC niche at the core of mucosal immune responses in the oropharynx.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01502-4"
"ni","Conserved stromal-immune cell circuits secure B cell homeostasis and function","B cell zone reticular cells (BRCs) form stable microenvironments that direct efficient humoral immunity with B cell priming and memory maintenance being orchestrated across lymphoid organs. However, a comprehensive understanding of systemic humoral immunity is hampered by the lack of knowledge of global BRC sustenance, function and major pathways controlling BRC-immune cell interactions. Here we dissected the BRC landscape and immune cell interactome in human and murine lymphoid organs. In addition to the major BRC subsets underpinning the follicle, including follicular dendritic cells, PI16+ RCs were present across organs and species. As well as BRC-produced niche factors, immune cell-driven BRC differentiation and activation programs governed the convergence of shared BRC subsets, overwriting tissue-specific gene signatures. Our data reveal that a canonical set of immune cell-provided cues enforce bidirectional signaling programs that sustain functional BRC niches across lymphoid organs and species, thereby securing efficient humoral immunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01503-3"

"ni","Conserved transcriptional connectivity of regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment informs new combination cancer therapy strategies","While regulatory T (Treg) cells are traditionally viewed as professional suppressors of antigen presenting cells and effector T cells in both autoimmunity and cancer, recent findings of distinct Treg cell functions in tissue maintenance suggest that their regulatory purview extends to a wider range of cells and is broader than previously assumed. To elucidate tumoral Treg cell 'connectivity' to diverse tumor-supporting accessory cell types, we explored immediate early changes in their single-cell transcriptomes upon punctual Treg cell depletion in experimental lung cancer and injury-induced inflammation. Before any notable T cell activation and inflammation, fibroblasts, endothelial and myeloid cells exhibited pronounced changes in their gene expression in both cancer and injury settings. Factor analysis revealed shared Treg cell-dependent gene programs, foremost, prominent upregulation of VEGF and CCR2 signaling-related genes upon Treg cell deprivation in either setting, as well as in Treg cell-poor versus Treg cell-rich human lung adenocarcinomas. Accordingly, punctual Treg cell depletion combined with short-term VEGF blockade showed markedly improved control of PD-1 blockade-resistant lung adenocarcinoma progression in mice compared to the corresponding monotherapies, highlighting a promising factor-based querying approach to elucidating new rational combination treatments of solid organ cancers.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01504-2"
"ni","Human memory B cells show plasticity and adopt multiple fates upon recall response to SARS-CoV-2","The B cell response to different pathogens uses tailored effector mechanisms and results in functionally specialized memory B (Bm) cell subsets, including CD21+ resting, CD21-CD27+ activated and CD21-CD27- Bm cells. The interrelatedness between these Bm cell subsets remains unknown. Here we showed that single severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific Bm cell clones showed plasticity upon antigen rechallenge in previously exposed individuals. CD21- Bm cells were the predominant subsets during acute infection and early after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-specific immunization. At months 6 and 12 post-infection, CD21+ resting Bm cells were the major Bm cell subset in the circulation and were also detected in peripheral lymphoid organs, where they carried tissue residency markers. Tracking of individual B cell clones by B cell receptor sequencing revealed that previously fated Bm cell clones could redifferentiate upon antigen rechallenge into other Bm cell subsets, including CD21-CD27- Bm cells, demonstrating that single Bm cell clones can adopt functionally different trajectories.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01497-y"
"ni","Dynamic mitochondrial transcription and translation in B cells control germinal center entry and lymphomagenesis","Germinal center (GC) B cells undergo proliferation at very high rates in a hypoxic microenvironment but the cellular processes driving this are incompletely understood. Here we show that the mitochondria of GC B cells are highly dynamic, with significantly upregulated transcription and translation rates associated with the activity of transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM). TFAM, while also necessary for normal B cell development, is required for entry of activated GC precursor B cells into the germinal center reaction; deletion of Tfam significantly impairs GC formation, function and output. Loss of TFAM in B cells compromises the actin cytoskeleton and impairs cellular motility of GC B cells in response to chemokine signaling, leading to their spatial disorganization. We show that B cell lymphoma substantially increases mitochondrial translation and that deletion of Tfam in B cells is protective against the development of lymphoma in a c-Myc transgenic mouse model. Finally, we show that pharmacological inhibition of mitochondrial transcription and translation inhibits growth of GC-derived human lymphoma cells and induces similar defects in the actin cytoskeleton.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01484-3"
"ni","High-dimensional analysis of 16 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine combinations reveals lymphocyte signatures correlating with immunogenicity","The range of vaccines developed against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) provides a unique opportunity to study immunization across different platforms. In a single-center cohort, we analyzed the humoral and cellular immune compartments following five coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines spanning three technologies (adenoviral, mRNA and inactivated virus) administered in 16 combinations. For adenoviral and inactivated-virus vaccines, heterologous combinations were generally more immunogenic compared to homologous regimens. The mRNA vaccine as the second dose resulted in the strongest antibody response and induced the highest frequency of spike-binding memory B cells irrespective of the priming vaccine. Priming with the inactivated-virus vaccine increased the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response, whereas boosting did not. Distinct immune signatures were elicited by the different vaccine combinations, demonstrating that the immune response is shaped by the type of vaccines applied and the order in which they are delivered. These data provide a framework for improving future vaccine strategies against pathogens and cancer.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01499-w"
"ni","Slow integrin-dependent migration organizes networks of tissue-resident mast cells","Immune cell locomotion is associated with amoeboid migration, a flexible mode of movement, which depends on rapid cycles of actin polymerization and actomyosin contraction1. Many immune cells do not necessarily require integrins, the major family of adhesion receptors in mammals, to move productively through three-dimensional tissue spaces2,3. Instead, they can use alternative strategies to transmit their actin-driven forces to the substrate, explaining their migratory adaptation to changing external environments4,5,6. However, whether these generalized concepts apply to all immune cells is unclear. Here, we show that the movement of mast cells (immune cells with important roles during allergy and anaphylaxis) differs fundamentally from the widely applied paradigm of interstitial immune cell migration. We identify a crucial role for integrin-dependent adhesion in controlling mast cell movement and localization to anatomical niches rich in KIT ligand, the major mast cell growth and survival factor. Our findings show that substrate-dependent haptokinesis is an important mechanism for the tissue organization of resident immune cells.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01493-2"
"ni","Orthogonal cytokine engineering enables novel synthetic effector states escaping canonical exhaustion in tumor-rejecting CD8+ T cells","To date, no immunotherapy approaches have managed to fully overcome T-cell exhaustion, which remains a mandatory fate for chronically activated effector cells and a major therapeutic challenge. Understanding how to reprogram CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes away from exhausted effector states remains an elusive goal. Our work provides evidence that orthogonal gene engineering of T cells to secrete an interleukin (IL)-2 variant binding the IL-2R[beta][gamma] receptor and the alarmin IL-33 reprogrammed adoptively transferred T cells to acquire a novel, synthetic effector state, which deviated from canonical exhaustion and displayed superior effector functions. These cells successfully overcame homeostatic barriers in the host and led-in the absence of lymphodepletion or exogenous cytokine support-to high levels of engraftment and tumor regression. Our work unlocks a new opportunity of rationally engineering synthetic CD8+ T-cell states endowed with the ability to avoid exhaustion and control advanced solid tumors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01477-2"
"ni","G-CSF drives autoinflammation in APLAID","Missense mutations in PLCG2 can cause autoinflammation with phospholipase C gamma 2-associated antibody deficiency and immune dysregulation (APLAID). Here, we generated a mouse model carrying an APLAID mutation (p.Ser707Tyr) and found that inflammatory infiltrates in the skin and lungs were only partially ameliorated by removing inflammasome function via the deletion of caspase-1. Also, deleting interleukin-6 or tumor necrosis factor did not fully prevent APLAID mutant mice from autoinflammation. Overall, these findings are in accordance with the poor response individuals with APLAID have to treatments that block interleukin-1, JAK1/2 or tumor necrosis factor. Cytokine analysis revealed increased granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) levels as the most distinct feature in mice and individuals with APLAID. Remarkably, treatment with a G-CSF antibody completely reversed established disease in APLAID mice. Furthermore, excessive myelopoiesis was normalized and lymphocyte numbers rebounded. APLAID mice were also fully rescued by bone marrow transplantation from healthy donors, associated with reduced G-CSF production, predominantly from non-hematopoietic cells. In summary, we identify APLAID as a G-CSF-driven autoinflammatory disease, for which targeted therapy is feasible.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01473-6"
"ni","How autoreactive thymocytes differentiate into regulatory versus effector CD4+ T cells after avoiding clonal deletion","Thymocytes bearing autoreactive T cell receptors (TCRs) are agonist-signaled by TCR/co-stimulatory molecules to either undergo clonal deletion or to differentiate into specialized regulatory T (Treg) or effector T (Teff) CD4+ cells. How these different fates are achieved during development remains poorly understood. We now document that deletion and differentiation are agonist-signaled at different times during thymic selection and that Treg and Teff cells both arise after clonal deletion as alternative lineage fates of agonist-signaled CD4+CD25+ precursors. Disruption of agonist signaling induces CD4+CD25+ precursors to initiate Foxp3 expression and become Treg cells, whereas persistent agonist signaling induces CD4+CD25+ precursors to become IL-2+ Teff cells. Notably, we discovered that transforming growth factor-[beta] induces Foxp3 expression and promotes Treg cell development by disrupting weaker agonist signals and that Foxp3 expression is not induced by IL-2 except under non-physiological in vivo conditions. Thus, TCR signaling disruption versus persistence is a general mechanism of lineage fate determination in the thymus that directs development of agonist-signaled autoreactive thymocytes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01469-2"
"ni","Exhausted intratumoral V[delta]2− [gamma][delta] T cells in human kidney cancer retain effector function","Gamma delta ([gamma][delta]) T cells reside within human tissues including tumors, but their function in mediating antitumor responses to immune checkpoint inhibition is unknown. Here we show that kidney cancers are infiltrated by V[delta]2− [gamma][delta] T cells, with equivalent representation of V[delta]1+ and V[delta]1− cells, that are distinct from [gamma][delta] T cells found in normal human tissues. These tumor-resident V[delta]2− T cells can express the transcriptional program of exhausted [alpha][beta] CD8+ T cells as well as canonical markers of terminal T-cell exhaustion including PD-1, TIGIT and TIM-3. Although V[delta]2− [gamma][delta] T cells have reduced IL-2 production, they retain expression of cytolytic effector molecules and co-stimulatory receptors such as 4-1BB. Exhausted V[delta]2− [gamma][delta] T cells are composed of three distinct populations that lack TCF7, are clonally expanded and express cytotoxic molecules and multiple V[delta]2− T-cell receptors. Human tumor-derived V[delta]2− [gamma][delta] T cells maintain cytotoxic function and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in vitro. The transcriptional program of V[delta]2− T cells in pretreatment tumor biopsies was used to predict subsequent clinical responses to PD-1 blockade in patients with cancer. Thus, V[delta]2− [gamma][delta] T cells within the tumor microenvironment can contribute to antitumor efficacy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01448-7"
"ni","MafB-restricted local monocyte proliferation precedes lung interstitial macrophage differentiation","Resident tissue macrophages (RTMs) are differentiated immune cells that populate distinct niches and exert important tissue-supportive functions. RTM maintenance is thought to rely either on differentiation from monocytes or on RTM self-renewal. Here, we used a mouse model of inducible lung interstitial macrophage (IM) niche depletion and refilling to investigate the development of IMs in vivo. Using time-course single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses, bone marrow chimeras and gene targeting, we found that engrafted Ly6C+ classical monocytes proliferated locally in a Csf1 receptor-dependent manner before differentiating into IMs. The transition from monocyte proliferation toward IM subset specification was controlled by the transcription factor MafB, while c-Maf specifically regulated the identity of the CD206+ IM subset. Our data provide evidence that, in the mononuclear phagocyte system, the ability to proliferate is not merely restricted to myeloid progenitor cells and mature RTMs but is also a tightly regulated capability of monocytes developing into RTMs in vivo.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01468-3"
"ni","Novel mouse models based on intersectional genetics to identify and characterize plasmacytoid dendritic cells","Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are the main source of type I interferon (IFN-I) during viral infections. Their other functions are debated, due to a lack of tools to identify and target them in vivo without affecting pDC-like cells and transitional DCs (tDCs), which harbor overlapping phenotypes and transcriptomes but a higher efficacy for T cell activation. In the present report, we present a reporter mouse, pDC-Tom, designed through intersectional genetics based on unique Siglech and Pacsin1 coexpression in pDCs. The pDC-Tom mice specifically tagged pDCs and, on breeding with Zbtb46GFP mice, enabled transcriptomic profiling of all splenic DC types, unraveling diverging activation of pDC-like cells versus tDCs during a viral infection. The pDC-Tom mice also revealed initially similar but later divergent microanatomical relocation of splenic IFN+ versus IFN− pDCs during infection. The mouse models and specific gene modules we report here will be useful to delineate the physiological functions of pDCs versus other DC types.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01454-9"
"ni","A single-amino acid substitution in the adaptor LAT accelerates TCR proofreading kinetics and alters T-cell selection, maintenance and function","Mature T cells must discriminate between brief interactions with self-peptides and prolonged binding to agonists. The kinetic proofreading model posits that certain T-cell antigen receptor signaling nodes serve as molecular timers to facilitate such discrimination. However, the physiological significance of this regulatory mechanism and the pathological consequences of disrupting it are unknown. Here we report that accelerating the normally slow phosphorylation of the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) residue Y136 by introducing an adjacent Gly135Asp alteration (LATG135D) disrupts ligand discrimination in vivo. The enhanced self-reactivity of LATG135D T cells triggers excessive thymic negative selection and promotes T-cell anergy. During Listeria infection, LATG135D T cells expand more than wild-type counterparts in response to very weak stimuli but display an imbalance between effector and memory responses. Moreover, despite their enhanced engagement of central and peripheral tolerance mechanisms, mice bearing LATG135D show features associated with autoimmunity and immunopathology. Our data reveal the importance of kinetic proofreading in balancing tolerance and immunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01444-x"
"ni","Infection with wild-type SARS-CoV-2 elicits broadly neutralizing and protective antibodies against omicron subvariants","The omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 have substantial ability to escape infection- and vaccine-elicited antibody immunity. Here, we investigated the extent of such escape in nine convalescent patients infected with the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 during the first wave of the pandemic. Among the total of 476 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from peripheral memory B cells, we identified seven mAbs with broad neutralizing activity to all variants tested, including various omicron subvariants. Biochemical and structural analysis indicated the majority of these mAbs bound to the receptor-binding domain, mimicked the receptor ACE2 and were able to accommodate or inadvertently improve recognition of omicron substitutions. Passive delivery of representative antibodies protected K18-hACE2 mice from infection with omicron and beta SARS-CoV-2. A deeper understanding of how the memory B cells that produce these antibodies could be selectively boosted or recalled can augment antibody immunity against SARS-CoV-2 variants.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01449-6"
"ni","Autoantibodies against chemokines post-SARS-CoV-2 infection correlate with disease course","Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 associates with diverse symptoms, which can persist for months. While antiviral antibodies are protective, those targeting interferons and other immune factors are associated with adverse coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes. Here we discovered that antibodies against specific chemokines were omnipresent post-COVID-19, were associated with favorable disease outcome and negatively correlated with the development of long COVID at 1 yr post-infection. Chemokine antibodies were also present in HIV-1 infection and autoimmune disorders, but they targeted different chemokines compared with COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies derived from COVID-19 convalescents that bound to the chemokine N-loop impaired cell migration. Given the role of chemokines in orchestrating immune cell trafficking, naturally arising chemokine antibodies may modulate the inflammatory response and thus bear therapeutic potential.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01445-w"
"ni","CD40 signal rewires fatty acid and glutamine metabolism for stimulating macrophage anti-tumorigenic functions","Exposure of lipopolysaccharide triggers macrophage pro-inflammatory polarization accompanied by metabolic reprogramming, characterized by elevated aerobic glycolysis and a broken tricarboxylic acid cycle. However, in contrast to lipopolysaccharide, CD40 signal is able to drive pro-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic polarization by some yet undefined metabolic programming. Here we show that CD40 activation triggers fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and glutamine metabolism to promote ATP citrate lyase-dependent epigenetic reprogramming of pro-inflammatory genes and anti-tumorigenic phenotypes in macrophages. Mechanistically, glutamine usage reinforces FAO-induced pro-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic activation by fine-tuning the NAD+/NADH ratio via glutamine-to-lactate conversion. Genetic ablation of important metabolic enzymes involved in CD40-mediated metabolic reprogramming abolishes agonistic anti-CD40-induced antitumor responses and reeducation of tumor-associated macrophages. Together these data show that metabolic reprogramming, which includes FAO and glutamine metabolism, controls the activation of pro-inflammatory and anti-tumorigenic polarization, and highlight a therapeutic potential of metabolic preconditioning of tumor-associated macrophages before agonistic anti-CD40 treatments.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01430-3"

"ni","IFN[gamma] binding to extracellular matrix prevents fatal systemic toxicity","Interferon-[gamma] (IFN[gamma]) is an important mediator of cellular immune responses, but high systemic levels of this cytokine are associated with immunopathology. IFN[gamma] binds to its receptor (IFN[gamma]R) and to extracellular matrix (ECM) via four positively charged C-terminal amino acids (KRKR), the ECM-binding domain (EBD). Across evolution, IFN[gamma] is not well conserved, but the EBD is highly conserved, suggesting a critical function. Here, we show that IFN[gamma] lacking the EBD (IFN[gamma]ΔKRKR) does not bind to ECM but still binds to the IFN[gamma]R and retains bioactivity. Overexpression of IFN[gamma]ΔKRKR in tumors reduced local ECM binding, increased systemic levels and induced sickness behavior, weight loss and toxicity. To analyze the function of the EBD during infection, we generated IFN[gamma]ΔKRKR mice lacking the EBD by using CRISPR-Cas9. Infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus resulted in higher systemic IFN[gamma]ΔKRKR levels, enhanced sickness behavior, weight loss and fatal toxicity. We conclude that local retention of IFN[gamma] is a pivotal mechanism to protect the organism from systemic toxicity during prolonged immune stimulation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-023-01420-5"
"ni","A patient-centric modeling framework captures recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection","The biology driving individual patient responses to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection remains ill understood. Here, we developed a patient-centric framework leveraging detailed longitudinal phenotyping data and covering a year after disease onset, from 215 infected individuals with differing disease severities. Our analyses revealed distinct 'systemic recovery' profiles, with specific progression and resolution of the inflammatory, immune cell, metabolic and clinical responses. In particular, we found a strong inter-patient and intra-patient temporal covariation of innate immune cell numbers, kynurenine metabolites and lipid metabolites, which highlighted candidate immunologic and metabolic pathways influencing the restoration of homeostasis, the risk of death and that of long COVID. Based on these data, we identified a composite signature predictive of systemic recovery, using a joint model on cellular and molecular parameters measured soon after disease onset. New predictions can be generated using the online tool http://shiny.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/apps/covid-19-systemic-recovery-prediction-app, designed to test our findings prospectively.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01380-2"
"ni","Dermal macrophages set pain sensitivity by modulating the amount of tissue NGF through an SNX25-Nrf2 pathway","Cross-talk between peripheral neurons and immune cells is important in pain sensation. We identified Snx25 as a pain-modulating gene in a transgenic mouse line with reduced pain sensitivity. Conditional deletion of Snx25 in monocytes and macrophages, but not in peripheral sensory neurons, in mice (Snx25cKO mice) reduced pain responses in both normal and neuropathic conditions. Bone marrow transplantation using Snx25cKO and wild-type mice indicated that macrophages modulated pain sensitivity. Expression of sorting nexin (SNX)25 in dermal macrophages enhanced expression of the neurotrophic factor NGF through the inhibition of ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Nrf2, a transcription factor that activates transcription of Ngf. As such, dermal macrophages set the threshold for pain sensitivity through the production and secretion of NGF into the dermis, and they may cooperate with dorsal root ganglion macrophages in pain perception.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01418-5"
"ni","Human TH17 cells engage gasdermin E pores to release IL-1[alpha] on NLRP3 inflammasome activation","It has been shown that innate immune responses can adopt adaptive properties such as memory. Whether T cells utilize innate immune signaling pathways to diversify their repertoire of effector functions is unknown. Gasdermin E (GSDME) is a membrane pore-forming molecule that has been shown to execute pyroptotic cell death and thus to serve as a potential cancer checkpoint. In the present study, we show that human T cells express GSDME and, surprisingly, that this expression is associated with durable viability and repurposed for the release of the alarmin interleukin (IL)-1[alpha]. This property was restricted to a subset of human helper type 17 T cells with specificity for Candida albicans and regulated by a T cell-intrinsic NLRP3 inflammasome, and its engagement of a proteolytic cascade of successive caspase-8, caspase-3 and GSDME cleavage after T cell receptor stimulation and calcium-licensed calpain maturation of the pro-IL-1[alpha] form. Our results indicate that GSDME pore formation in T cells is a mechanism of unconventional cytokine release. This finding diversifies our understanding of the functional repertoire and mechanistic equipment of T cells and has implications for antifungal immunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01386-w"
"ni","The phosphatidylinositol-transfer protein Nir3 promotes PI(4,5)P2 replenishment in response to TCR signaling during T cell development and survival","Hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by phospholipase C-[gamma] (PLC[gamma]1) represents a critical step in T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling and subsequent thymocyte and T cell responses. PIP2 replenishment following its depletion in the plasma membrane (PM) is dependent on delivery of its precursor phosphatidylinositol (PI) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the PM. We show that a PI transfer protein (PITP), Nir3 (Pitpnm2), promotes PIP2 replenishment following TCR stimulation and is important for T cell development. In Nir3-/- T lineage cells, the PIP2 replenishment following TCR stimulation is slower. Nir3 deficiency attenuates calcium mobilization in double-positive (DP) thymocytes in response to weak TCR stimulation. This impaired TCR signaling leads to attenuated thymocyte development at TCR[beta] selection and positive selection as well as diminished mature T cell fitness in Nir3-/- mice. This study highlights the importance of PIP2 replenishment mediated by PITPs at ER-PM junctions during TCR signaling.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01372-2"
"ni","SHP-2 and PD-1-SHP-2 signaling regulate myeloid cell differentiation and antitumor responses","The inhibitory receptor PD-1 suppresses T cell activation by recruiting the phosphatase SHP-2. However, mice with a T-cell-specific deletion of SHP-2 do not have improved antitumor immunity. Here we showed that mice with conditional targeting of SHP-2 in myeloid cells, but not in T cells, had diminished tumor growth. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) followed by gene set enrichment analysis indicated the presence of polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with enriched gene expression profiles of enhanced differentiation, activation and expression of immunostimulatory molecules. In mice with conditional targeting of PD-1 in myeloid cells, which also displayed diminished tumor growth, TAMs had gene expression profiles enriched for myeloid differentiation, activation and leukocyte-mediated immunity displaying >50% overlap with enriched profiles of SHP-2-deficient TAMs. In bone marrow, GM-CSF induced the phosphorylation of PD-1 and recruitment of PD-1-SHP-2 to the GM-CSF receptor. Deletion of SHP-2 or PD-1 enhanced GM-CSF-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factors HOXA10 and IRF8, which regulate myeloid differentiation and monocytic-moDC lineage commitment, respectively. Thus, SHP-2 and PD-1-SHP-2 signaling restrained myelocyte differentiation resulting in a myeloid landscape that suppressed antitumor immunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01385-x"
"ni","Unique roles of co-receptor-bound LCK in helper and cytotoxic T cells","The kinase LCK and CD4/CD8 co-receptors are crucial components of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling machinery, leading to key T cell fate decisions. Despite decades of research, the roles of CD4-LCK and CD8-LCK interactions in TCR triggering in vivo remain unknown. In this study, we created animal models expressing endogenous levels of modified LCK to resolve whether and how co-receptor-bound LCK drives TCR signaling. We demonstrated that the role of LCK depends on the co-receptor to which it is bound. The CD8-bound LCK is largely dispensable for antiviral and antitumor activity of cytotoxic T cells in mice; however, it facilitates CD8+ T cell responses to suboptimal antigens in a kinase-dependent manner. By contrast, the CD4-bound LCK is required for efficient development and function of helper T cells via a kinase-independent stabilization of surface CD4. Overall, our findings reveal the role of co-receptor-bound LCK in T cell biology, show that CD4- and CD8-bound LCK drive T cell development and effector immune responses using qualitatively different mechanisms and identify the co-receptor-LCK interactions as promising targets for immunomodulation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01366-0"
"ni","ETV3 and ETV6 enable monocyte differentiation into dendritic cells by repressing macrophage fate commitment","In inflamed tissues, monocytes differentiate into macrophages (mo-Macs) or dendritic cells (mo-DCs). In chronic nonresolving inflammation, mo-DCs are major drivers of pathogenic events. Manipulating monocyte differentiation would therefore be an attractive therapeutic strategy. However, how the balance of mo-DC versus mo-Mac fate commitment is regulated is not clear. In the present study, we show that the transcriptional repressors ETV3 and ETV6 control human monocyte differentiation into mo-DCs. ETV3 and ETV6 inhibit interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes; however, their action on monocyte differentiation is independent of IFN signaling. Instead, we find that ETV3 and ETV6 directly repress mo-Mac development by controlling MAFB expression. Mice deficient for Etv6 in monocytes have spontaneous expression of IFN-stimulated genes, confirming that Etv6 regulates IFN responses in vivo. Furthermore, these mice have impaired mo-DC differentiation during inflammation and reduced pathology in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model. These findings provide information about the molecular control of monocyte fate decision and identify ETV6 as a therapeutic target to redirect monocyte differentiation in inflammatory disorders.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01374-0"
"ni","Profound phenotypic and epigenetic heterogeneity of the HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cell reservoir","Understanding the complexity of the long-lived HIV reservoir during antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains a considerable impediment in research towards a cure for HIV. To address this, we developed a single-cell strategy to precisely define the unperturbed peripheral blood HIV-infected memory CD4+ T cell reservoir from ART-treated people living with HIV (ART-PLWH) via the presence of integrated accessible proviral DNA in concert with epigenetic and cell surface protein profiling. We identified profound reservoir heterogeneity within and between ART-PLWH, characterized by new and known surface markers within total and individual memory CD4+ T cell subsets. We further uncovered new epigenetic profiles and transcription factor motifs enriched in HIV-infected cells that suggest infected cells with accessible provirus, irrespective of reservoir distribution, are poised for reactivation during ART treatment. Together, our findings reveal the extensive inter- and intrapersonal cellular heterogeneity of the HIV reservoir, and establish an initial multiomic atlas to develop targeted reservoir elimination strategies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01371-3"
"ni","A genetic disorder reveals a hematopoietic stem cell regulatory network co-opted in leukemia","The molecular regulation of human hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance is therapeutically important, but limitations in experimental systems and interspecies variation have constrained our knowledge of this process. Here, we have studied a rare genetic disorder due to MECOM haploinsufficiency, characterized by an early-onset absence of HSCs in vivo. By generating a faithful model of this disorder in primary human HSCs and coupling functional studies with integrative single-cell genomic analyses, we uncover a key transcriptional network involving hundreds of genes that is required for HSC maintenance. Through our analyses, we nominate cooperating transcriptional regulators and identify how MECOM prevents the CTCF-dependent genome reorganization that occurs as HSCs differentiate. We show that this transcriptional network is co-opted in high-risk leukemias, thereby enabling these cancers to acquire stem cell properties. Collectively, we illuminate a regulatory network necessary for HSC self-renewal through the study of a rare experiment of nature.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01370-4"
"ni","Parenteral BCG vaccine induces lung-resident memory macrophages and trained immunity via the gut-lung axis","Aside from centrally induced trained immunity in the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood by parenteral vaccination or infection, evidence indicates that mucosal-resident innate immune memory can develop via a local inflammatory pathway following mucosal exposure. However, whether mucosal-resident innate memory results from integrating distally generated immunological signals following parenteral vaccination/infection is unclear. Here we show that subcutaneous Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccination can induce memory alveolar macrophages (AMs) and trained immunity in the lung. Although parenteral BCG vaccination trains BM progenitors and circulating monocytes, induction of memory AMs is independent of circulating monocytes. Rather, parenteral BCG vaccination, via mycobacterial dissemination, causes a time-dependent alteration in the intestinal microbiome, barrier function and microbial metabolites, and subsequent changes in circulating and lung metabolites, leading to the induction of memory macrophages and trained immunity in the lung. These data identify an intestinal microbiota-mediated pathway for innate immune memory development at distal mucosal tissues and have implications for the development of next-generation vaccine strategies against respiratory pathogens.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01354-4"
"ni","Fungal sensing by dectin-1 directs the non-pathogenic polarization of TH17 cells through balanced type I IFN responses in human DCs","The non-pathogenic TH17 subset of helper T cells clears fungal infections, whereas pathogenic TH17 cells cause inflammation and tissue damage; however, the mechanisms controlling these distinct responses remain unclear. Here we found that fungi sensing by the C-type lectin dectin-1 in human dendritic cells (DCs) directed the polarization of non-pathogenic TH17 cells. Dectin-1 signaling triggered transient and intermediate expression of interferon (IFN)-[beta] in DCs, which was mediated by the opposed activities of transcription factors IRF1 and IRF5. IFN-[beta]-induced signaling led to integrin [alpha]v[beta]8 expression directly and to the release of the active form of the cytokine transforming growth factor (TGF)-[beta] indirectly. Uncontrolled IFN-[beta] responses as a result of IRF1 deficiency induced high expression of the IFN-stimulated gene BST2 in DCs and restrained TGF-[beta] activation. Active TGF-[beta] was required for polarization of non-pathogenic TH17 cells, whereas pathogenic TH17 cells developed in the absence of active TGF-[beta]. Thus, dectin-1-mediated modulation of type I IFN responses allowed TGF-[beta] activation and non-pathogenic TH17 cell development during fungal infections in humans.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01348-2"
"ni","Distinct changes in endosomal composition promote NLRP3 inflammasome activation","Inflammasome complexes are pivotal in the innate immune response. The NLR family pyrin domain containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is activated in response to a broad variety of cellular stressors. However, a primary and converging sensing mechanism by the NLRP3 receptor initiating inflammasome assembly remains ill defined. Here, we demonstrate that NLRP3 inflammasome activators primarily converge on disruption of endoplasmic reticulum-endosome membrane contact sites (EECS). This defect causes endosomal accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) and a consequent impairment of endosome-to-trans-Golgi network trafficking (ETT), necessary steps for endosomal recruitment of NLRP3 and subsequent inflammasome activation. Lowering endosomal PI4P levels prevents endosomal association of NLRP3 and inhibits inflammasome activation. Disruption of EECS or ETT is sufficient to enhance endosomal PI4P levels, to recruit NLRP3 to endosomes and to potentiate NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mice with defects in ETT in the myeloid compartment are more susceptible to lipopolysaccharide-induced sepsis. Our study thus identifies a distinct cellular mechanism leading to endosomal NLRP3 recruitment and inflammasome activation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01355-3"
"ni","Pan-vaccine analysis reveals innate immune endotypes predictive of antibody responses to vaccination","Several studies have shown that the pre-vaccination immune state is associated with the antibody response to vaccination. However, the generalizability and mechanisms that underlie this association remain poorly defined. Here, we sought to identify a common pre-vaccination signature and mechanisms that could predict the immune response across 13 different vaccines. Analysis of blood transcriptional profiles across studies revealed three distinct pre-vaccination endotypes, characterized by the differential expression of genes associated with a pro-inflammatory response, cell proliferation, and metabolism alterations. Importantly, individuals whose pre-vaccination endotype was enriched in pro-inflammatory response genes known to be downstream of nuclear factor-kappa B showed significantly higher serum antibody responses 1 month after vaccination. This pro-inflammatory pre-vaccination endotype showed gene expression characteristic of the innate activation state triggered by Toll-like receptor ligands or adjuvants. These results demonstrate that wide variations in the transcriptional state of the immune system in humans can be a key determinant of responsiveness to vaccination.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01329-5"
"ni","Clonal expansion and epigenetic inheritance of long-lasting NK cell memory","Clonal expansion of cells with somatically diversified receptors and their long-term maintenance as memory cells is a hallmark of adaptive immunity. Here, we studied pathogen-specific adaptation within the innate immune system, tracking natural killer (NK) cell memory to human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. Leveraging single-cell multiomic maps of ex vivo NK cells and somatic mitochondrial DNA mutations as endogenous barcodes, we reveal substantial clonal expansion of adaptive NK cells in HCMV+ individuals. NK cell clonotypes were characterized by a convergent inflammatory memory signature enriched for AP1 motifs superimposed on a private set of clone-specific accessible chromatin regions. NK cell clones were stably maintained in specific epigenetic states over time, revealing that clonal inheritance of chromatin accessibility shapes the epigenetic memory repertoire. Together, we identify clonal expansion and persistence within the human innate immune system, suggesting that these mechanisms have evolved independent of antigen-receptor diversification.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01327-7"
"ni","CMTM4 is a subunit of the IL-17 receptor and mediates autoimmune pathology","Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) is a key mediator of protective immunity to yeast and bacterial infections but also drives the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis. Here we show that the tetra-transmembrane protein CMTM4 is a subunit of the IL-17 receptor (IL-17R). CMTM4 constitutively associated with IL-17R subunit C to mediate its stability, glycosylation and plasma membrane localization. Both mouse and human cell lines deficient in CMTM4 were largely unresponsive to IL-17A, due to their inability to assemble the IL-17R signaling complex. Accordingly, CMTM4-deficient mice had a severe defect in the recruitment of immune cells following IL-17A administration and were largely resistant to experimental psoriasis, but not to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Collectively, our data identified CMTM4 as an essential component of IL-17R and a potential therapeutic target for treating IL-17-mediated autoimmune diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01325-9"
"ni","IL-17D-induced inhibition of DDX5 expression in keratinocytes amplifies IL-36R-mediated skin inflammation","Aberrant RNA splicing in keratinocytes drives inflammatory skin disorders. In the present study, we found that the RNA helicase DDX5 was downregulated in keratinocytes from the inflammatory skin lesions in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, and that mice with keratinocyte-specific deletion of Ddx5 (Ddx5∆KC) were more susceptible to cutaneous inflammation. Inhibition of DDX5 expression in keratinocytes was induced by the cytokine interleukin (IL)-17D through activation of the CD93-p38 MAPK-AKT-SMAD2/3 signaling pathway and led to pre-messenger RNA splicing events that favored the production of membrane-bound, intact IL-36 receptor (IL-36R) at the expense of soluble IL-36R (sIL-36R) and to the selective amplification of IL-36R-mediated inflammatory responses and cutaneous inflammation. Restoration of sIL-36R in Ddx5∆KC mice with experimental atopic dermatitis or psoriasis suppressed skin inflammation and alleviated the disease phenotypes. These findings indicate that IL-17D modulation of DDX5 expression controls inflammation in keratinocytes during inflammatory skin diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01339-3"
"ni","Kinetic proofreading through the multi-step activation of the ZAP70 kinase underlies early T cell ligand discrimination","T cells recognize a few high-affinity antigens among a vast array of lower affinity antigens. According to the kinetic proofreading model, antigen discrimination properties could be explained by the gradual amplification of small differences in binding affinities as the signal is transduced downstream of the T cell receptor. Which early molecular events are affected by ligand affinity, and how, has not been fully resolved. Here, we used time-resolved high-throughput proteomic analyses to identify and quantify the phosphorylation events and protein-protein interactions encoding T cell ligand discrimination in antigen-experienced T cells. Although low-affinity ligands induced phosphorylation of the Cd3 chains of the T cell receptor and the interaction of Cd3 with the Zap70 kinase as strongly as high-affinity ligands, they failed to activate Zap70 to the same extent. As a result, formation of the signalosome of the Lat adaptor was severely impaired with low- compared with high-affinity ligands, whereas formation of the signalosome of the Cd6 receptor was affected only partially. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive map of molecular events associated with T cell ligand discrimination.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01288-x"
"ni","Airway-resident T cells from unexposed individuals cross-recognize SARS-CoV-2","T cells can contribute to clearance of respiratory viruses that cause acute-resolving infections such as SARS-CoV-2, helping to provide long-lived protection against disease. Recent studies have suggested an additional role for T cells in resisting overt infection: pre-existing cross-reactive responses were preferentially enriched in healthcare workers who had abortive infections1, and in household contacts protected from infection2. We hypothesize that such early viral control would require pre-existing cross-reactive memory T cells already resident at the site of infection; such airway-resident responses have been shown to be critical for mediating protection after intranasal vaccination in a murine model of SARS-CoV3. Bronchoalveolar lavage samples from the lower respiratory tract of healthy donors obtained before the COVID-19 pandemic revealed airway-resident, SARS-CoV-2-cross-reactive T cells, which correlated with the strength of human seasonal coronavirus immunity. We therefore demonstrate the potential to harness functional airway-resident SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in next-generation mucosal vaccines.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01292-1"
"ni","Type I IFNs promote cancer cell stemness by triggering the epigenetic regulator KDM1B","Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of cancer cells endowed with high tumorigenic, chemoresistant and metastatic potential. Nongenetic mechanisms of acquired resistance are increasingly being discovered, but molecular insights into the evolutionary process of CSCs are limited. Here, we show that type I interferons (IFNs-I) function as molecular hubs of resistance during immunogenic chemotherapy, triggering the epigenetic regulator demethylase 1B (KDM1B) to promote an adaptive, yet reversible, transcriptional rewiring of cancer cells towards stemness and immune escape. Accordingly, KDM1B inhibition prevents the appearance of IFN-I-induced CSCs, both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, IFN-I-induced CSCs are heterogeneous in terms of multidrug resistance, plasticity, invasiveness and immunogenicity. Moreover, in breast cancer (BC) patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy, KDM1B positively correlated with CSC signatures. Our study identifies an IFN-I -> KDM1B axis as a potent engine of cancer cell reprogramming, supporting KDM1B targeting as an attractive adjunctive to immunogenic drugs to prevent CSC expansion and increase the long-term benefit of therapy.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01290-3"
"ni","Inflammation triggers ILC3 patrolling of the intestinal barrier","An orchestrated cellular network, including adaptive lymphocytes and group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), maintains intestinal barrier integrity and homeostasis. T cells can monitor environmental insults through constitutive circulation, scanning tissues and forming immunological contacts, a process named immunosurveillance. In contrast, the dynamics of intestinal ILC3s are unknown. Using intravital imaging, we observed that villus ILC3s were largely immotile at steady state but acquired migratory 'patrolling' attributes and enhanced cytokine expression in response to inflammation. We showed that T cells, the chemokine CCL25 and bacterial ligands regulated intestinal ILC3 behavior and that loss of patrolling behavior by interleukin-22 (IL-22)-producing ILC3s altered the intestinal barrier through increased epithelial cell death. Collectively, we identified notable differences between the behavior of ILC3s and T cells, with a prominent adaptation of intestinal ILC3s toward mucosal immunosurveillance after inflammation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01284-1"
"ni","Differences in CD80 and CD86 transendocytosis reveal CD86 as a key target for CTLA-4 immune regulation","CD28 and CTLA-4 (CD152) play essential roles in regulating T cell immunity, balancing the activation and inhibition of T cell responses, respectively. Although both receptors share the same ligands, CD80 and CD86, the specific requirement for two distinct ligands remains obscure. In the present study, we demonstrate that, although CTLA-4 targets both CD80 and CD86 for destruction via transendocytosis, this process results in separate fates for CTLA-4 itself. In the presence of CD80, CTLA-4 remained ligand bound, and was ubiquitylated and trafficked via late endosomes and lysosomes. In contrast, in the presence of CD86, CTLA-4 detached in a pH-dependent manner and recycled back to the cell surface to permit further transendocytosis. Furthermore, we identified clinically relevant mutations that cause autoimmune disease, which selectively disrupted CD86 transendocytosis, by affecting either CTLA-4 recycling or CD86 binding. These observations provide a rationale for two distinct ligands and show that defects in CTLA-4-mediated transendocytosis of CD86 are associated with autoimmunity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01289-w"
"ni","Partial RAG deficiency in humans induces dysregulated peripheral lymphocyte development and humoral tolerance defect with accumulation of T-bet+ B cells","The recombination-activating genes (RAG) 1 and 2 are indispensable for diversifying the primary B cell receptor repertoire and pruning self-reactive clones via receptor editing in the bone marrow; however, the impact of RAG1/RAG2 on peripheral tolerance is unknown. Partial RAG deficiency (pRD) manifesting with late-onset immune dysregulation represents an 'experiment of nature' to explore this conundrum. By studying B cell development and subset-specific repertoires in pRD, we demonstrate that reduced RAG activity impinges on peripheral tolerance through the generation of a restricted primary B cell repertoire, persistent antigenic stimulation and an inflammatory milieu with elevated B cell-activating factor. This unique environment gradually provokes profound B cell dysregulation with widespread activation, remarkable extrafollicular maturation and persistence, expansion and somatic diversification of self-reactive clones. Through the model of pRD, we reveal a RAG-dependent 'domino effect' that impacts stringency of tolerance and B cell fate in the periphery.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01271-6"

Here, we show molecular signals controlling cellular, physical, and structural properties and collectively determine tissue mechanics of lymph nodes, an immunologically relevant adult tissue. Lymph nodes paradoxically maintain robust tissue architecture in homeostasis yet are continually poised for extensive expansion upon immune challenge. We find that in murine models of immune challenge, cytoskeletal mechanics of a cellular meshwork of fibroblasts determine tissue tension independently of extracellular matrix scaffolds. We determine that C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2)-podoplanin signaling regulates the cell surface mechanics of fibroblasts, providing a mechanically sensitive pathway to regulate lymph node remodeling. Perturbation of fibroblast mechanics through genetic deletion of podoplanin attenuates T cell activation. We find that increased tissue tension through the fibroblastic stromal meshwork is required to trigger the initiation of fibroblast proliferation and restore homeostatic cellular ratios and tissue structure through lymph node expansion.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01272-5"

Immunological challenge causes LNs to increase more than tenfold in size within a few days. Here, we characterized the biomechanics of LN swelling on the cellular and organ scale. We identified lymphocyte trapping by influx and proliferation as drivers of an outward pressure force, causing fibroblastic reticular cells of the T-zone (TRCs) and their associated conduits to stretch. After an initial phase of relaxation, TRCs sensed the resulting strain through cell matrix adhesions, which coordinated local growth and remodeling of the stromal network. While the expanded TRC network readopted its typical configuration, a massive fibrotic reaction of the organ capsule set in and countered further organ expansion. Thus, different fibroblast populations mechanically control LN swelling in a multitier fashion.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01257-4"

The clonal relationship and evolution of memory B cells and circulating plasmablasts is not well understood. Using single-cell sequencing combined with isolation of specific antibodies, we found that in two healthy donors, the memory B cell repertoire was dominated by large IgM, IgA and IgG2 clonal families, whereas IgG1 families, including those specific for recall antigens, were of small size. Analysis of multiyear samples demonstrated stability of memory B cell clonal families and revealed that a large fraction of recently generated plasmablasts was derived from long-term memory B cell families and was found recurrently. Collectively, this study provides a systematic description of the structure, stability and dynamics of the human memory B cell pool and suggests that memory B cells may be active at any time point in the generation of plasmablasts.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01230-1"

Knowledge of the GBM immune microenvironment during tumor evolution and standard of care treatments is limited. Using single-cell transcriptomics and flow cytometry, we unveiled large-scale comprehensive longitudinal changes in immune cell composition throughout tumor progression in an epidermal growth factor receptor-driven genetic mouse GBM model. We identified subsets of proinflammatory microglia in developing GBMs and anti-inflammatory macrophages and protumorigenic myeloid-derived suppressors cells in end-stage tumors, an evolution that parallels breakdown of the blood-brain barrier and extensive growth of epidermal growth factor receptor+ GBM cells. A similar relationship was found between microglia and macrophages in patient biopsies of low-grade glioma and GBM. Temozolomide decreased the accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells, whereas concomitant temozolomide irradiation increased intratumoral GranzymeB+ CD8+T cells but also increased CD4+ regulatory T cells. These results provide a comprehensive and unbiased immune cellular landscape and its evolutionary changes during GBM progression.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01215-0"
"ni","NLRP3 licenses NLRP11 for inflammasome activation in human macrophages","Intracellular sensing of stress and danger signals initiates inflammatory innate immune responses by triggering inflammasome assembly, caspase-1 activation and pyroptotic cell death as well as the release of interleukin 1[beta] (IL-1[beta]), IL-18 and danger signals. NLRP3 broadly senses infectious patterns and sterile danger signals, resulting in the tightly coordinated and regulated assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome, but the precise mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we identified NLRP11 as an essential component of the NLRP3 inflammasome in human macrophages. NLRP11 interacted with NLRP3 and ASC, and deletion of NLRP11 specifically prevented NLRP3 inflammasome activation by preventing inflammasome assembly, NLRP3 and ASC polymerization, caspase-1 activation, pyroptosis and cytokine release but did not affect other inflammasomes. Restored expression of NLRP11, but not NLRP11 lacking the PYRIN domain (PYD), restored inflammasome activation. NLRP11 was also necessary for inflammasome responses driven by NLRP3 mutations that cause cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS). Because NLRP11 is not expressed in mice, our observations emphasize the specific complexity of inflammasome regulation in humans.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01220-3"
"ni","Hypoxia shapes the immune landscape in lung injury and promotes the persistence of inflammation","Hypoxemia is a defining feature of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), an often-fatal complication of pulmonary or systemic inflammation, yet the resulting tissue hypoxia, and its impact on immune responses, is often neglected. In the present study, we have shown that ARDS patients were hypoxemic and monocytopenic within the first 48 h of ventilation. Monocytopenia was also observed in mouse models of hypoxic acute lung injury, in which hypoxemia drove the suppression of type I interferon signaling in the bone marrow. This impaired monopoiesis resulted in reduced accumulation of monocyte-derived macrophages and enhanced neutrophil-mediated inflammation in the lung. Administration of colony-stimulating factor 1 in mice with hypoxic lung injury rescued the monocytopenia, altered the phenotype of circulating monocytes, increased monocyte-derived macrophages in the lung and limited injury. Thus, tissue hypoxia altered the dynamics of the immune response to the detriment of the host and interventions to address the aberrant response offer new therapeutic strategies for ARDS.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01216-z"

Full utility in the neuroinflammation space, however, requires identification of both effective targets for local immune modulation and a delivery system capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. The recent identification and characterization of a small population of regulatory T (Treg) cells resident in the brain presents one such potential therapeutic target. Here, we identified brain interleukin 2 (IL-2) levels as a limiting factor for brain-resident Treg cells. We developed a gene-delivery approach for astrocytes, with a small-molecule on-switch to allow temporal control, and enhanced production in reactive astrocytes to spatially direct delivery to inflammatory sites. Mice with brain-specific IL-2 delivery were protected in traumatic brain injury, stroke and multiple sclerosis models, without impacting the peripheral immune system. These results validate brain-specific IL-2 gene delivery as effective protection against neuroinflammation, and provide a versatile platform for delivery of diverse biologics to neuroinflammatory patients.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01208-z"
"ni","Reversal of the T cell immune system reveals the molecular basis for T cell lineage fate determination in the thymus","T cell specificity and function are linked during development, as MHC-II-specific TCR signals generate CD4 helper T cells and MHC-I-specific TCR signals generate CD8 cytotoxic T cells, but the basis remains uncertain. We now report that switching coreceptor proteins encoded by Cd4 and Cd8 gene loci functionally reverses the T cell immune system, generating CD4 cytotoxic and CD8 helper T cells. Such functional reversal reveals that coreceptor proteins promote the helper-lineage fate when encoded by Cd4, but promote the cytotoxic-lineage fate when encoded in Cd8-regardless of the coreceptor proteins each locus encodes. Thus, T cell lineage fate is determined by cis-regulatory elements in coreceptor gene loci and is not determined by the coreceptor proteins they encode, invalidating coreceptor signal strength as the basis of lineage fate determination. Moreover, we consider that evolution selected the particular coreceptor proteins that Cd4 and Cd8 gene loci encode to avoid generating functionally reversed T cells because they fail to promote protective immunity against environmental pathogens.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01187-1"
"ni","Mitochondrial electron transport chain is necessary for NLRP3 inflammasome activation","The NLRP3 inflammasome is linked to sterile and pathogen-dependent inflammation, and its dysregulation underlies many chronic diseases. Mitochondria have been implicated as regulators of the NLRP3 inflammasome through several mechanisms including generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we report that mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complex I, II, III and V inhibitors all prevent NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Ectopic expression of Saccharomyces cerevisiae NADH dehydrogenase (NDI1) or Ciona intestinalis alternative oxidase, which can complement the functional loss of mitochondrial complex I or III, respectively, without generation of ROS, rescued NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the absence of endogenous mitochondrial complex I or complex III function. Metabolomics revealed phosphocreatine (PCr), which can sustain ATP levels, as a common metabolite that is diminished by mitochondrial ETC inhibitors. PCr depletion decreased ATP levels and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Thus, the mitochondrial ETC sustains NLRP3 inflammasome activation through PCr-dependent generation of ATP, but via a ROS-independent mechanism.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01185-3"
"ni","Neutrophils direct preexisting matrix to initiate repair in damaged tissues","Internal organs heal injuries with new connective tissue, but the cellular and molecular events of this process remain obscure. By tagging extracellular matrix around the mesothelium lining in mouse peritoneum, liver and cecum, here we show that preexisting matrix was transferred across organs into wounds in various injury models. Using proteomics, genetic lineage-tracing and selective injury in juxtaposed organs, we found that the tissue of origin for the transferred matrix likely dictated the scarring or regeneration of the healing tissue. Single-cell RNA sequencing and genetic and chemical screens indicated that the preexisting matrix was transferred by neutrophils dependent on the HSF-integrin AM/B2-kindlin3 cascade. Pharmacologic inhibition of this axis prevented matrix transfer and the formation of peritoneal adhesions. Matrix transfer was thus an early event of wound repair and provides a therapeutic window to dampen scaring across a range of conditions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-022-01166-6"

"ni","Normality sensing licenses local T cells for innate-like tissue surveillance","The increasing implication of lymphocytes in general physiology and immune surveillance outside of infection poses the question of how their antigen receptors might be involved. Here, we show that macromolecular aggregates of intraepidermal [gamma][delta] T cell antigen receptors (TCRs) in the mouse skin aligned with and depended on Skint1, a butyrophilin-like (BTNL) protein expressed by differentiated keratinocytes (KCs) at steady state. Interruption of TCR-mediated 'normality sensing' had no impact on [gamma][delta] T cell numbers but altered their signature phenotype, while the epidermal barrier function was compromised. In addition to the regulation of steady-state physiology, normality sensing licensed intraepidermal T cells to respond rapidly to subsequent tissue perturbation by using innate tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily receptors. Thus, interfering with Skint1-dependent interactions between local [gamma][delta] T cells and KCs at steady state increased the susceptibility to ultraviolet B radiation (UVR)-induced DNA damage and inflammation, two cancer-disposing factors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01124-8"
"ni","The immunoregulatory landscape of human tuberculosis granulomas","Tuberculosis (TB) in humans is characterized by formation of immune-rich granulomas in infected tissues, the architecture and composition of which are thought to affect disease outcome. However, our understanding of the spatial relationships that control human granulomas is limited. Here, we used multiplexed ion beam imaging by time of flight (MIBI-TOF) to image 37 proteins in tissues from patients with active TB. We constructed a comprehensive atlas that maps 19 cell subsets across 8 spatial microenvironments. This atlas shows an IFN-[gamma]-depleted microenvironment enriched for TGF-[beta], regulatory T cells and IDO1+ PD-L1+ myeloid cells. In a further transcriptomic meta-analysis of peripheral blood from patients with TB, immunoregulatory trends mirror those identified by granuloma imaging. Notably, PD-L1 expression is associated with progression to active TB and treatment response. These data indicate that in TB granulomas, there are local spatially coordinated immunoregulatory programs with systemic manifestations that define active TB.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01121-x"
"ni","Children develop robust and sustained cross-reactive spike-specific immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection","SARS-CoV-2 infection is generally mild or asymptomatic in children but a biological basis for this outcome is unclear. Here we compare antibody and cellular immunity in children (aged 3-11 years) and adults. Antibody responses against spike protein were high in children and seroconversion boosted responses against seasonal Beta-coronaviruses through cross-recognition of the S2 domain. Neutralization of viral variants was comparable between children and adults. Spike-specific T cell responses were more than twice as high in children and were also detected in many seronegative children, indicating pre-existing cross-reactive responses to seasonal coronaviruses. Importantly, children retained antibody and cellular responses 6 months after infection, whereas relative waning occurred in adults. Spike-specific responses were also broadly stable beyond 12 months. Therefore, children generate robust, cross-reactive and sustained immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 with focused specificity for the spike protein. These findings provide insight into the relative clinical protection that occurs in most children and might help to guide the design of pediatric vaccination regimens.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01089-8"
"ni","An immunodominant NP105-113-B*07:02 cytotoxic T cell response controls viral replication and is associated with less severe COVID-19 disease","NP105-113-B*07:02-specific CD8+ T cell responses are considered among the most dominant in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. We found strong association of this response with mild disease. Analysis of NP105-113-B*07:02-specific T cell clones and single-cell sequencing were performed concurrently, with functional avidity and antiviral efficacy assessed using an in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infection system, and were correlated with T cell receptor usage, transcriptome signature and disease severity (acute n = 77, convalescent n = 52). We demonstrated a beneficial association of NP105-113-B*07:02-specific T cells in COVID-19 disease progression, linked with expansion of T cell precursors, high functional avidity and antiviral effector function. Broad immune memory pools were narrowed postinfection but NP105-113-B*07:02-specific T cells were maintained 6 months after infection with preserved antiviral efficacy to the SARS-CoV-2 Victoria strain, as well as Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants. Our data show that NP105-113-B*07:02-specific T cell responses associate with mild disease and high antiviral efficacy, pointing to inclusion for future vaccine design.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01084-z"
"ni","Single-cell proteo-genomic reference maps of the hematopoietic system enable the purification and massive profiling of precisely defined cell states","Single-cell genomics technology has transformed our understanding of complex cellular systems. However, excessive cost and a lack of strategies for the purification of newly identified cell types impede their functional characterization and large-scale profiling. Here, we have generated high-content single-cell proteo-genomic reference maps of human blood and bone marrow that quantitatively link the expression of up to 197 surface markers to cellular identities and biological processes across all main hematopoietic cell types in healthy aging and leukemia. These reference maps enable the automatic design of cost-effective high-throughput cytometry schemes that outperform state-of-the-art approaches, accurately reflect complex topologies of cellular systems and permit the purification of precisely defined cell states. The systematic integration of cytometry and proteo-genomic data enables the functional capacities of precisely mapped cell states to be measured at the single-cell level. Our study serves as an accessible resource and paves the way for a data-driven era in cytometry.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01059-0"
"ni","Robust IgM responses following intravenous vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Guérin associate with prevention of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in macaques","Development of an effective tuberculosis (TB) vaccine has suffered from an incomplete understanding of the correlates of protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Intravenous (i.v.) vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) provides nearly complete protection against TB in rhesus macaques, but the antibody response it elicits remains incompletely defined. Here we show that i.v. BCG drives superior antibody responses in the plasma and the lungs of rhesus macaques compared to traditional intradermal BCG administration. While i.v. BCG broadly expands antibody titers and functions, IgM titers in the plasma and lungs of immunized macaques are among the strongest markers of reduced bacterial burden. IgM was also enriched in macaques that received protective vaccination with an attenuated strain of Mtb. Finally, an Mtb-specific IgM monoclonal antibody reduced Mtb survival in vitro. Collectively, these data highlight the potential importance of IgM responses as a marker and mediator of protection against TB.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01066-1"
"ni","Low-dose in vivo protection and neutralization across SARS-CoV-2 variants by monoclonal antibody combinations","Prevention of viral escape and increased coverage against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern require therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting multiple sites of vulnerability on the coronavirus spike glycoprotein. Here we identify several potent neutralizing antibodies directed against either the N-terminal domain (NTD) or the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Administered in combinations, these mAbs provided low-dose protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in the K18-human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 mouse model, using both neutralization and Fc effector antibody functions. The RBD mAb WRAIR-2125, which targets residue F486 through a unique heavy-chain and light-chain pairing, demonstrated potent neutralizing activity against all major SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In combination with NTD and other RBD mAbs, WRAIR-2125 also prevented viral escape. These data demonstrate that NTD/RBD mAb combinations confer potent protection, likely leveraging complementary mechanisms of viral inactivation and clearance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01068-z"
"ni","Dichotomous metabolic networks govern human ILC2 proliferation and function","Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent innate homologs of type 2 helper T cells (TH2) that participate in immune defense and tissue homeostasis through production of type 2 cytokines. While T lymphocytes metabolically adapt to microenvironmental changes, knowledge of human ILC2 metabolism is limited, and its key regulators are unknown. Here, we show that circulating 'naive' ILC2s have an unexpected metabolic profile with a higher level of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) than natural killer (NK) cells. Accordingly, ILC2s are severely reduced in individuals with mitochondrial disease (MD) and impaired OXPHOS. Metabolomic and nutrient receptor analysis revealed ILC2 uptake of amino acids to sustain OXPHOS at steady state. Following activation with interleukin-33 (IL-33), ILC2s became highly proliferative, relying on glycolysis and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to produce IL-13 while continuing to fuel OXPHOS with amino acids to maintain cellular fitness and proliferation. Our results suggest that proliferation and function are metabolically uncoupled in human ILC2s, offering new strategies to target ILC2s in disease settings.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01043-8"
"ni","Circadian clocks guide dendritic cells into skin lymphatics","Migration of leukocytes from the skin to lymph nodes (LNs) via afferent lymphatic vessels (LVs) is pivotal for adaptive immune responses1,2. Circadian rhythms have emerged as important regulators of leukocyte trafficking to LNs via the blood3,4. Here, we demonstrate that dendritic cells (DCs) have a circadian migration pattern into LVs, which peaks during the rest phase in mice. This migration pattern is determined by rhythmic gradients in the expression of the chemokine CCL21 and of adhesion molecules in both mice and humans. Chronopharmacological targeting of the involved factors abrogates circadian migration of DCs. We identify cell-intrinsic circadian oscillations in skin lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and DCs that cogovern these rhythms, as their genetic disruption in either cell type ablates circadian trafficking. These observations indicate that circadian clocks control the infiltration of DCs into skin lymphatics, a process that is essential for many adaptive immune responses and relevant for vaccination and immunotherapies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01040-x"
"ni","Distinct systemic and mucosal immune responses during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection","Coordinated local mucosal and systemic immune responses following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection either protect against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathologies or fail, leading to severe clinical outcomes. To understand this process, we performed an integrated analysis of SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific antibodies, cytokines, viral load and bacterial communities in paired nasopharyngeal swabs and plasma samples from a cohort of clinically distinct patients with COVID-19 during acute infection. Plasma viral load was associated with systemic inflammatory cytokines that were elevated in severe COVID-19, and also with spike-specific neutralizing antibodies. By contrast, nasopharyngeal viral load correlated with SARS-CoV-2 humoral responses but inversely with interferon responses, the latter associating with protective microbial communities. Potential pathogenic microorganisms, often implicated in secondary respiratory infections, were associated with mucosal inflammation and elevated in severe COVID-19. Our results demonstrate distinct tissue compartmentalization of SARS-CoV-2 immune responses and highlight a role for the nasopharyngeal microbiome in regulating local and systemic immunity that determines COVID-19 clinical outcomes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41590-021-01028-7"
