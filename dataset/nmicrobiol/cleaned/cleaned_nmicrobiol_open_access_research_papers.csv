Despite its role in the evolution of denitrification and aerobic respiration, high redox potential and capacity to sustain microbial growth, our understanding of NO-reducing microorganisms remains limited due to the absence of NO-reducing microbial cultures obtained directly from the environment using NO as a substrate. Here, using a continuous bioreactor and a constant supply of NO as the sole electron acceptor, we enriched and characterized a microbial community dominated by two previously unknown microorganisms that grow at nanomolar NO concentrations and survive high amounts (>6 µM) of this toxic gas, reducing it to N2 with little to non-detectable production of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide. These results provide insight into the physiology of NO-reducing microorganisms, which have pivotal roles in the control of climate-active gases, waste removal, and evolution of nitrate and oxygen respiration.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01425-8"
"nmicrobiol","Parabacteroides distasonis uses dietary inulin to suppress NASH via its metabolite pentadecanoic acid","Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is characterized by liver inflammation and fat accumulation. Dietary interventions, such as fibre, have been shown to alleviate this metabolic disorder in mice via the gut microbiota. Here, we investigated the mechanistic role of the gut microbiota in ameliorating NASH via dietary fibre in mice. Soluble fibre inulin was found to be more effective than insoluble fibre cellulose to suppress NASH progression in mice, as shown by reduced hepatic steatosis, necro-inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. We employed stable isotope probing to trace the incorporation of 13C-inulin into gut bacterial genomes and metabolites during NASH progression. Shotgun metagenome sequencing revealed that the commensal Parabacteroides distasonis was enriched by 13C-inulin. Integration of 13C-inulin metagenomes and metabolomes suggested that P. distasonis used inulin to produce pentadecanoic acid, an odd-chain fatty acid, which was confirmed in vitro and in germ-free mice. P. distasonis or pentadecanoic acid was protective against NASH in mice. Mechanistically, inulin, P. distasonis or pentadecanoic acid restored gut barrier function in NASH models, which reduced serum lipopolysaccharide and liver pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Overall this shows that gut microbiota members can use dietary fibre to generate beneficial metabolites to suppress metabolic disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01418-7"
"nmicrobiol","d-amino acids signal a stress-dependent run-away response in Vibrio cholerae","To explore favourable niches while avoiding threats, many bacteria use a chemotaxis navigation system. Despite decades of studies on chemotaxis, most signals and sensory proteins are still unknown. Many bacterial species release d-amino acids to the environment; however, their function remains largely unrecognized. Here we reveal that d-arginine and d-lysine are chemotactic repellent signals for the cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae. These d-amino acids are sensed by a single chemoreceptor MCPDRK co-transcribed with the racemase enzyme that synthesizes them under the control of the stress-response sigma factor RpoS. Structural characterization of this chemoreceptor bound to either d-arginine or d-lysine allowed us to pinpoint the residues defining its specificity. Interestingly, the specificity for these d-amino acids appears to be restricted to those MCPDRK orthologues transcriptionally linked to the racemase. Our results suggest that d-amino acids can shape the biodiversity and structure of complex microbial communities under adverse conditions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01419-6"
"nmicrobiol","Modelling viral encephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus 1 infection in cerebral organoids","Herpes simplex encephalitis is a life-threatening disease of the central nervous system caused by herpes simplex viruses (HSVs). Following standard of care with antiviral acyclovir treatment, most patients still experience various neurological sequelae. Here we characterize HSV-1 infection of human brain organoids by combining single-cell RNA sequencing, electrophysiology and immunostaining. We observed strong perturbations of tissue integrity, neuronal function and cellular transcriptomes. Under acyclovir treatment viral replication was stopped, but did not prevent HSV-1-driven defects such as damage of neuronal processes and neuroepithelium. Unbiased analysis of pathways deregulated upon infection revealed tumour necrosis factor activation as a potential causal factor. Combination of anti-inflammatory drugs such as necrostatin-1 or bardoxolone methyl with antiviral treatment prevented the damages caused by infection, indicating that tuning the inflammatory response in acute infection may improve current therapeutic strategies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01405-y"
"nmicrobiol","Streptomyces polyketides mediate bacteria-fungi interactions across soil environments","Although the interaction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms is crucial for the functioning of ecosystems, information about the processes driving microbial interactions within communities remains scarce. Here we show that arginine-derived polyketides (arginoketides) produced by Streptomyces species mediate cross-kingdom microbial interactions with fungi of the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium, and trigger the production of natural products. Arginoketides can be cyclic or linear, and a prominent example is azalomycin F produced by Streptomyces iranensis, which induces the cryptic orsellinic acid gene cluster in Aspergillus nidulans. Bacteria that synthesize arginoketides and fungi that decode and respond to this signal were co-isolated from the same soil sample. Genome analyses and a literature search indicate that arginoketide producers are found worldwide. Because, in addition to their direct impact, arginoketides induce a secondary wave of fungal natural products, they probably contribute to the wider structure and functioning of entire soil microbial communities.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01382-2"
"nmicrobiol","Mechanistic basis for potent neutralization of Sin Nombre hantavirus by a human monoclonal antibody","Rodent-borne hantaviruses are prevalent worldwide and upon spillover to human populations, cause severe disease for which no specific treatment is available. A potent antibody response is key for recovery from hantavirus infection. Here we study a highly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, termed SNV-42, which was derived from a memory B cell isolated from an individual with previous Sin Nombre virus (SNV) infection. Crystallographic analysis demonstrates that SNV-42 targets the Gn subcomponent of the tetrameric (Gn−Gc)4 glycoprotein assembly that is relevant for viral entry. Integration of our 1.8 Å structure with the (Gn−Gc)4 ultrastructure arrangement indicates that SNV-42 targets the membrane-distal region of the virus envelope. Comparison of the SNV-42 paratope encoding variable genes with inferred germline gene segments reveals high sequence conservation, suggesting that germline-encoded antibodies inhibit SNV. Furthermore, mechanistic assays reveal that SNV-42 interferes with both receptor recognition and fusion during host-cell entry. This work provides a molecular-level blueprint for understanding the human neutralizing antibody response to hantavirus infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01413-y"
"nmicrobiol","Assimilatory sulfate reduction in the marine methanogen Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus","Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus is the only known methanogen that grows on sulfate as its sole sulfur source, uniquely uniting methanogenesis and sulfate reduction. Here we use physiological, biochemical and structural analyses to provide a snapshot of the complete sulfate reduction pathway of this methanogenic archaeon. We find that later steps in this pathway are catalysed by atypical enzymes. PAPS (3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate) released by APS kinase is converted into sulfite and 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP) by a PAPS reductase that is similar to the APS reductases of dissimilatory sulfate reduction. A non-canonical PAP phosphatase then hydrolyses PAP. Finally, the F420-dependent sulfite reductase converts sulfite to sulfide for cellular assimilation. While metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies suggest that the sulfate reduction pathway is present in several methanogens, the sulfate assimilation pathway in M. thermolithotrophicus is distinct. We propose that this pathway was 'mix-and-matched' through the acquisition of assimilatory and dissimilatory enzymes from other microorganisms and then repurposed to fill a unique metabolic role.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01398-8"
"nmicrobiol","Candidatus Alkanophaga archaea from Guaymas Basin hydrothermal vent sediment oxidize petroleum alkanes","Methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea produce and consume the greenhouse gas methane, respectively, using the reversible enzyme methyl-coenzyme M reductase (Mcr). Recently, Mcr variants that can activate multicarbon alkanes have been recovered from archaeal enrichment cultures. These enzymes, called alkyl-coenzyme M reductase (Acrs), are widespread in the environment but remain poorly understood. Here we produced anoxic cultures degrading mid-chain petroleum n-alkanes between pentane (C5) and tetradecane (C14) at 70  degreesC using oil-rich Guaymas Basin sediments. In these cultures, archaea of the genus Candidatus Alkanophaga activate the alkanes with Acrs and completely oxidize the alkyl groups to CO2. Ca. Alkanophaga form a deep-branching sister clade to the methanotrophs ANME-1 and are closely related to the short-chain alkane oxidizers Ca. Syntrophoarchaeum. Incapable of sulfate reduction, Ca. Alkanophaga shuttle electrons released from alkane oxidation to the sulfate-reducing Ca. Thermodesulfobacterium syntrophicum. These syntrophic consortia are potential key players in petroleum degradation in heated oil reservoirs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01400-3"
"nmicrobiol","Coronavirus sampling and surveillance in bats from 1996-2019: a systematic review and meta-analysis","The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 highlights a need for evidence-based strategies to monitor bat viruses. We performed a systematic review of coronavirus sampling (testing for RNA positivity) in bats globally. We identified 110 studies published between 2005 and 2020 that collectively reported positivity from 89,752 bat samples. We compiled 2,274 records of infection prevalence at the finest methodological, spatiotemporal and phylogenetic level of detail possible from public records into an open, static database named datacov, together with metadata on sampling and diagnostic methods. We found substantial heterogeneity in viral prevalence across studies, reflecting spatiotemporal variation in viral dynamics and methodological differences. Meta-analysis identified sample type and sampling design as the best predictors of prevalence, with virus detection maximized in rectal and faecal samples and by repeat sampling of the same site. Fewer than one in five studies collected and reported longitudinal data, and euthanasia did not improve virus detection. We show that bat sampling before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was concentrated in China, with research gaps in South Asia, the Americas and sub-Saharan Africa, and in subfamilies of phyllostomid bats. We propose that surveillance strategies should address these gaps to improve global health security and enable the origins of zoonotic coronaviruses to be identified.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01375-1"
"nmicrobiol","Particular genomic and virulence traits associated with preterm infant-derived toxigenic Clostridium perfringens strains","Clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic toxin-producing bacterium associated with intestinal diseases, particularly in neonatal humans and animals. Infant gut microbiome studies have recently indicated a link between C. perfringens and the preterm infant disease necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), with specific NEC cases associated with overabundant C. perfringens termed C. perfringens-associated NEC (CPA-NEC). In the present study, we carried out whole-genome sequencing of 272 C. perfringens isolates from 70 infants across 5 hospitals in the United Kingdom. In this retrospective analysis, we performed in-depth genomic analyses (virulence profiling, strain tracking and plasmid analysis) and experimentally characterized pathogenic traits of 31 strains, including 4 from CPA-NEC patients. We found that the gene encoding toxin perfringolysin O, pfoA, was largely deficient in a human-derived hypovirulent lineage, as well as certain colonization factors, in contrast to typical pfoA-encoding virulent lineages. We determined that infant-associated pfoA+ strains caused significantly more cellular damage than pfoA− strains in vitro, and further confirmed this virulence trait in vivo using an oral-challenge C57BL/6 murine model. These findings suggest both the importance of pfoA+ C. perfringens as a gut pathogen in preterm infants and areas for further investigation, including potential intervention and therapeutic strategies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01385-z"

"nmicrobiol","Atlas of mRNA translation and decay for bacteria","Regulation of messenger RNA stability is pivotal for programmed gene expression in bacteria and is achieved by a myriad of molecular mechanisms. By bulk sequencing of 5' monophosphorylated mRNA decay intermediates (5'P), we show that cotranslational mRNA degradation is conserved among both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. We demonstrate that, in species with 5'-3' exonucleases, the exoribonuclease RNase J tracks the trailing ribosome to produce an in vivo single-nucleotide toeprint of the 5' position of the ribosome. In other species lacking 5'-3' exonucleases, ribosome positioning alters endonucleolytic cleavage sites. Using our metadegradome (5'P degradome) sequencing approach, we characterize 5'P mRNA decay intermediates in 96 species including Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Synechocystis spp. and Prevotella copri and identify codon- and gene-level ribosome stalling responses to stress and drug treatment. We also apply 5'P sequencing to complex clinical and environmental microbiomes and demonstrate that metadegradome sequencing provides fast, species-specific posttranscriptional characterization of responses to drug or environmental perturbations. Finally we produce a degradome atlas for 96 species to enable analysis of mechanisms of RNA degradation in bacteria. Our work paves the way for the application of metadegradome sequencing to investigation of posttranscriptional regulation in unculturable species and complex microbial communities.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01393-z"
"nmicrobiol","Pan-sarbecovirus prophylaxis with human anti-ACE2 monoclonal antibodies","Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that target the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein have been isolated from convalescent individuals and developed into therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, therapeutic mAbs for SARS-CoV-2 have been rendered obsolete by the emergence of mAb-resistant virus variants. Here we report the generation of a set of six human mAbs that bind the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) receptor, rather than the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We show that these antibodies block infection by all hACE2 binding sarbecoviruses tested, including SARS-CoV-2 ancestral, Delta and Omicron variants at concentrations of ~7-100 ng ml−1. These antibodies target an hACE2 epitope that binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike, but they do not inhibit hACE2 enzymatic activity nor do they induce cell-surface depletion of hACE2. They have favourable pharmacology, protect hACE2 knock-in mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection and should present a high genetic barrier to the acquisition of resistance. These antibodies should be useful prophylactic and treatment agents against any current or future SARS-CoV-2 variants and might be useful to treat infection with any hACE2-binding sarbecoviruses that emerge in the future.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01389-9"
"nmicrobiol","Reconstruction of the personal information from human genome reads in gut metagenome sequencing data","Human DNA present in faecal samples can result in a small number of human reads in gut shotgun metagenomic sequencing data. However, it is presently unclear how much personal information can be reconstructed from such reads, and this has not been quantitatively evaluated. Such a quantitative evaluation is necessary to clarify the ethical concerns related to data sharing and to enable efficient use of human genetic information in stool samples, such as for research and forensics. Here we used genomic approaches to reconstruct personal information from the faecal metagenomes of 343 Japanese individuals with associated human genotype data. Genetic sex could be accurately predicted based on the sequencing depth of sex chromosomes for 97.3% of the samples. Individuals could be re-identified from the matched genotype data based on human reads recovered from the faecal metagenomic data with 93.3% sensitivity using a likelihood score-based method. This method also enabled us to predict the ancestries of 98.3% of the samples. Finally, we performed ultra-deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing of five faecal samples as well as whole-genome sequencing of blood samples. Using genotype-calling approaches, we demonstrated that the genotypes of both common and rare variants could be reconstructed from faecal samples. This included clinically relevant variants. Our approach can be used to quantify personal information contained within gut metagenome data.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01381-3"
"nmicrobiol","Chloroquine resistance evolution in Plasmodium falciparum is mediated by the putative amino acid transporter AAT1","Malaria parasites break down host haemoglobin into peptides and amino acids in the digestive vacuole for export to the parasite cytoplasm for growth: interrupting this process is central to the mode of action of several antimalarial drugs. Mutations in the chloroquine (CQ) resistance transporter, pfcrt, located in the digestive vacuole membrane, confer CQ resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, and typically also affect parasite fitness. However, the role of other parasite loci in the evolution of CQ resistance is unclear. Here we use a combination of population genomics, genetic crosses and gene editing to demonstrate that a second vacuolar transporter plays a key role in both resistance and compensatory evolution. Longitudinal genomic analyses of the Gambian parasites revealed temporal signatures of selection on a putative amino acid transporter (pfaat1) variant S258L, which increased from 0% to 97% in frequency between 1984 and 2014 in parallel with the pfcrt1 K76T variant. Parasite genetic crosses then identified a chromosome 6 quantitative trait locus containing pfaat1 that is selected by CQ treatment. Gene editing demonstrated that pfaat1 S258L potentiates CQ resistance but at a cost of reduced fitness, while pfaat1 F313S, a common southeast Asian polymorphism, reduces CQ resistance while restoring fitness. Our analyses reveal hidden complexity in CQ resistance evolution, suggesting that pfaat1 may underlie regional differences in the dynamics of resistance evolution, and modulate parasite resistance or fitness by manipulating the balance between both amino acid and drug transport.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01377-z"
"nmicrobiol","The gut microbiota contributes to the pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa in humans and mice","Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder with a high mortality. About 95% of cases are women and it has a population prevalence of about 1%, but evidence-based treatment is lacking. The pathogenesis of AN probably involves genetics and various environmental factors, and an altered gut microbiota has been observed in individuals with AN using amplicon sequencing and relatively small cohorts. Here we investigated whether a disrupted gut microbiota contributes to AN pathogenesis. Shotgun metagenomics and metabolomics were performed on faecal and serum samples, respectively, from a cohort of 77 females with AN and 70 healthy females. Multiple bacterial taxa (for example, Clostridium species) were altered in AN and correlated with estimates of eating behaviour and mental health. The gut virome was also altered in AN including a reduction in viral-bacterial interactions. Bacterial functional modules associated with the degradation of neurotransmitters were enriched in AN and various structural variants in bacteria were linked to metabolic features of AN. Serum metabolomics revealed an increase in metabolites associated with reduced food intake (for example, indole-3-propionic acid). Causal inference analyses implied that serum bacterial metabolites are potentially mediating the impact of an altered gut microbiota on AN behaviour. Further, we performed faecal microbiota transplantation from AN cases to germ-free mice under energy-restricted feeding to mirror AN eating behaviour. We found that the reduced weight gain and induced hypothalamic and adipose tissue gene expression were related to aberrant energy metabolism and eating behaviour. Our 'omics' and mechanistic studies imply that a disruptive gut microbiome may contribute to AN pathogenesis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01355-5"
"nmicrobiol","Babesia duncani multi-omics identifies virulence factors and drug targets","Babesiosis is a malaria-like disease in humans and animals that is caused by Babesia species, which are tick-transmitted apicomplexan pathogens. Babesia duncani causes severe to lethal infection in humans, but despite the risk that this parasite poses as an emerging pathogen, little is known about its biology, metabolic requirements or pathogenesis. Unlike other apicomplexan parasites that infect red blood cells, B. duncani can be continuously cultured in vitro in human erythrocytes and can infect mice resulting in fulminant babesiosis and death. We report comprehensive, detailed molecular, genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses to gain insights into the biology of B. duncani. We completed the assembly, 3D structure and annotation of its nuclear genome, and analysed its transcriptomic and epigenetics profiles during its asexual life cycle stages in human erythrocytes. We used RNA-seq data to produce an atlas of parasite metabolism during its intraerythrocytic life cycle. Characterization of the B. duncani genome, epigenome and transcriptome identified classes of candidate virulence factors, antigens for diagnosis of active infection and several attractive drug targets. Furthermore, metabolic reconstitutions from genome annotation and in vitro efficacy studies identified antifolates, pyrimethamine and WR-99210 as potent inhibitors of B. duncani to establish a pipeline of small molecules that could be developed as effective therapies for the treatment of human babesiosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01360-8"
"nmicrobiol","Expanding known viral diversity in the healthy infant gut","The gut microbiome is shaped through infancy and impacts the maturation of the immune system, thus protecting against chronic disease later in life. Phages, or viruses that infect bacteria, modulate bacterial growth by lysis and lysogeny, with the latter being especially prominent in the infant gut. Viral metagenomes (viromes) are difficult to analyse because they span uncharted viral diversity, lacking marker genes and standardized detection methods. Here we systematically resolved the viral diversity in faecal viromes from 647 1-year-olds belonging to Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010, an unselected Danish cohort of healthy mother-child pairs. By assembly and curation we uncovered 10,000 viral species from 248 virus family-level clades (VFCs). Most (232 VFCs) were previously unknown, belonging to the Caudoviricetes viral class. Hosts were determined for 79% of phage using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat spacers within bacterial metagenomes from the same children. Typical Bacteroides-infecting crAssphages were outnumbered by undescribed phage families infecting Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Phage lifestyles were conserved at the viral family level, with 33 virulent and 118 temperate phage families. Virulent phages were more abundant, while temperate ones were more prevalent and diverse. Together, the viral families found in this study expand existing phage taxonomy and provide a resource aiding future infant gut virome research.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01345-7"
"nmicrobiol","Uropathogenic Escherichia coli infection-induced epithelial trained immunity impacts urinary tract disease outcome","Previous urinary tract infections (UTIs) can predispose one to future infections; however, the underlying mechanisms affecting recurrence are poorly understood. We previously found that UTIs in mice cause differential bladder epithelial (urothelial) remodelling, depending on disease outcome, that impacts susceptibility to recurrent UTI. Here we compared urothelial stem cell (USC) lines isolated from mice with a history of either resolved or chronic uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) infection, elucidating evidence of molecular imprinting that involved epigenetic changes, including differences in chromatin accessibility, DNA methylation and histone modification. Epigenetic marks in USCs from chronically infected mice enhanced caspase-1-mediated cell death upon UPEC infection, promoting bacterial clearance. Increased Ptgs2os2 expression also occurred, potentially contributing to sustained cyclooxygenase-2 expression, bladder inflammation and mucosal wounding-responses associated with severe recurrent cystitis. Thus, UPEC infection acts as an epi-mutagen reprogramming the urothelial epigenome, leading to urothelial-intrinsic remodelling and training of the innate response to subsequent infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01346-6"
"nmicrobiol","Viruses interact with hosts that span distantly related microbial domains in dense hydrothermal mats","Many microbes in nature reside in dense, metabolically interdependent communities. We investigated the nature and extent of microbe-virus interactions in relation to microbial density and syntrophy by examining microbe-virus interactions in a biomass dense, deep-sea hydrothermal mat. Using metagenomic sequencing, we find numerous instances where phylogenetically distant (up to domain level) microbes encode CRISPR-based immunity against the same viruses in the mat. Evidence of viral interactions with hosts cross-cutting microbial domains is particularly striking between known syntrophic partners, for example those engaged in anaerobic methanotrophy. These patterns are corroborated by proximity-ligation-based (Hi-C) inference. Surveys of public datasets reveal additional viruses interacting with hosts across domains in diverse ecosystems known to harbour syntrophic biofilms. We propose that the entry of viral particles and/or DNA to non-primary host cells may be a common phenomenon in densely populated ecosystems, with eco-evolutionary implications for syntrophic microbes and CRISPR-mediated inter-population augmentation of resilience against viruses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01347-5"
"nmicrobiol","Vaccine plus microbicide effective in preventing vaginal SIV transmission in macaques","The human immunodeficiency virus epidemic continues in sub-Saharan Africa, and particularly affects adolescent girls and women who have limited access to antiretroviral therapy. Here we report that the risk of vaginal simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)mac251 acquisition is reduced by more than 90% using a combination of a vaccine comprising V1-deleted (V2 enhanced) SIV envelope immunogens with topical treatment of the zinc-finger inhibitor SAMT-247. Following 14 weekly intravaginal exposures to the highly pathogenic SIVmac251, 80% of a cohort of 20 macaques vaccinated and treated with SAMT-247 remained uninfected. In an arm of 18 vaccinated-only animals without microbicide, 40% of macaques remained uninfected. The combined SAMT-247/vaccine regimen was significantly more effective than vaccination alone. By analysing immune correlates of protection, we show that, by increasing zinc availability, SAMT-247 increases natural killer cytotoxicity and monocyte efferocytosis, and decreases T-cell activation to augment vaccine-induced protection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01353-7"

Future control of the pandemic requires improved vaccines with high efficacy against newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and the ability to reduce virus transmission. Here we compare immune responses and preclinical efficacy of the mRNA vaccine BNT162b2, the adenovirus-vectored spike vaccine Ad2-spike and the live-attenuated virus vaccine candidate sCPD9 in Syrian hamsters, using both homogeneous and heterologous vaccination regimens. Comparative vaccine efficacy was assessed by employing readouts from virus titrations to single-cell RNA sequencing. Our results show that sCPD9 vaccination elicited the most robust immunity, including rapid viral clearance, reduced tissue damage, fast differentiation of pre-plasmablasts, strong systemic and mucosal humoral responses, and rapid recall of memory T cells from lung tissue after challenge with heterologous SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our results demonstrate that live-attenuated vaccines offer advantages over currently available COVID-19 vaccines.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01352-8"
"nmicrobiol","Probe-based bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing predicts toxin regulation","Clonal bacterial populations rely on transcriptional variation across individual cells to produce specialized states that increase fitness. Understanding all cell states requires studying isogenic bacterial populations at the single-cell level. Here we developed probe-based bacterial sequencing (ProBac-seq), a method that uses libraries of DNA probes and an existing commercial microfluidic platform to conduct bacterial single-cell RNA sequencing. We sequenced the transcriptome of thousands of individual bacterial cells per experiment, detecting several hundred transcripts per cell on average. Applied to Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, ProBac-seq correctly identifies known cell states and uncovers previously unreported transcriptional heterogeneity. In the context of bacterial pathogenesis, application of the approach to Clostridium perfringens reveals heterogeneous expression of toxin by a subpopulation that can be controlled by acetate, a short-chain fatty acid highly prevalent in the gut. Overall, ProBac-seq can be used to uncover heterogeneity in isogenic microbial populations and identify perturbations that affect pathogenicity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01348-4"
"nmicrobiol","No evidence for a common blood microbiome based on a population study of 9,770 healthy humans","Human blood is conventionally considered sterile but recent studies suggest the presence of a blood microbiome in healthy individuals. Here we characterized the DNA signatures of microbes in the blood of 9,770 healthy individuals using sequencing data from multiple cohorts. After filtering for contaminants, we identified 117 microbial species in blood, some of which had DNA signatures of microbial replication. They were primarily commensals associated with the gut (n = 40), mouth (n = 32) and genitourinary tract (n = 18), and were distinct from pathogens detected in hospital blood cultures. No species were detected in 84% of individuals, while the remainder only had a median of one species. Less than 5% of individuals shared the same species, no co-occurrence patterns between different species were observed and no associations between host phenotypes and microbes were found. Overall, these results do not support the hypothesis of a consistent core microbiome endogenous to human blood. Rather, our findings support the transient and sporadic translocation of commensal microbes from other body sites into the bloodstream.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01350-w"

"nmicrobiol","Monocyte-derived macrophages contain persistent latent HIV reservoirs","The development of persistent cellular reservoirs of latent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a critical obstacle to viral eradication since viral rebound takes place once anti-retroviral therapy (ART) is interrupted. Previous studies show that HIV persists in myeloid cells (monocytes and macrophages) in blood and tissues in virologically suppressed people with HIV (vsPWH). However, how myeloid cells contribute to the size of the HIV reservoir and what impact they have on rebound after treatment interruption remain unclear. Here we report the development of a human monocyte-derived macrophage quantitative viral outgrowth assay (MDM-QVOA) and highly sensitive T cell detection assays to confirm purity. We assess the frequency of latent HIV in monocytes using this assay in a longitudinal cohort of vsPWH (n = 10, 100% male, ART duration 5-14 yr) and find half of the participants showed latent HIV in monocytes. In some participants, these reservoirs could be detected over several years. Additionally, we assessed HIV genomes in monocytes from 30 vsPWH (27% male, ART duration 5-22 yr) utilizing a myeloid-adapted intact proviral DNA assay (IPDA) and demonstrate that intact genomes were present in 40% of the participants and higher total HIV DNA correlated with reactivatable latent reservoirs. The virus produced in the MDM-QVOA was capable of infecting bystander cells resulting in viral spread. These findings provide further evidence that myeloid cells meet the definition of a clinically relevant HIV reservoir and emphasize that myeloid reservoirs should be included in efforts towards an HIV cure.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01349-3"

How canonical and non-canonical autophagy function to control Mtb infection in phagosomes and the cytosol remains unresolved. Macrophages are the main host cell in humans for Mtb. Here we studied the contributions of canonical and non-canonical autophagy in the genetically tractable human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived macrophages (iPSDM), using a set of Mtb mutants generated in the same genetic background of the common lab strain H37Rv. We monitored replication of Mtb mutants that are either unable to trigger canonical autophagy (Mtb ΔesxBA) or reportedly unable to block non-canonical autophagy (Mtb ΔcpsA) in iPSDM lacking either ATG7 or ATG14 using single-cell high-content imaging. We report that deletion of ATG7 by CRISPR-Cas9 in iPSDM resulted in increased replication of wild-type Mtb but not of Mtb ΔesxBA or Mtb ΔcpsA. We show that deletion of ATG14 resulted in increased replication of both Mtb wild type and the mutant Mtb ΔesxBA. Using Mtb reporters and quantitative imaging, we identified a role for ATG14 in regulating fusion of phagosomes containing Mtb with lysosomes, thereby enabling intracellular bacteria restriction. We conclude that ATG7 and ATG14 are both required for restricting Mtb replication in human macrophages.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01335-9"
"nmicrobiol","Hyperactive nanobacteria with host-dependent traits pervade Omnitrophota","Candidate bacterial phylum Omnitrophota has not been isolated and is poorly understood. We analysed 72 newly sequenced and 349 existing Omnitrophota genomes representing 6 classes and 276 species, along with Earth Microbiome Project data to evaluate habitat, metabolic traits and lifestyles. We applied fluorescence-activated cell sorting and differential size filtration, and showed that most Omnitrophota are ultra-small (~0.2 [mu]m) cells that are found in water, sediments and soils. Omnitrophota genomes in 6 classes are reduced, but maintain major biosynthetic and energy conservation pathways, including acetogenesis (with or without the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway) and diverse respirations. At least 64% of Omnitrophota genomes encode gene clusters typical of bacterial symbionts, suggesting host-associated lifestyles. We repurposed quantitative stable-isotope probing data from soils dominated by andesite, basalt or granite weathering and identified 3 families with high isotope uptake consistent with obligate bacterial predators. We propose that most Omnitrophota inhabit various ecosystems as predators or parasites.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01319-1"
"nmicrobiol","Bile salt hydrolases shape the bile acid landscape and restrict Clostridioides difficile growth in the murine gut","Bile acids (BAs) mediate the crosstalk between human and microbial cells and influence diseases including Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). While bile salt hydrolases (BSHs) shape the BA pool by deconjugating conjugated BAs, the basis for their substrate selectivity and impact on C. difficile remain elusive. Here we survey the diversity of BSHs in the gut commensals Lactobacillaceae, which are commonly used as probiotics, and other members of the human gut microbiome. We structurally pinpoint a loop that predicts BSH preferences for either glycine or taurine substrates. BSHs with varying specificities were shown to restrict C. difficile spore germination and growth in vitro and colonization in pre-clinical in vivo models of CDI. Furthermore, BSHs reshape the pool of microbial conjugated bile acids (MCBAs) in the murine gut, and these MCBAs can further restrict C. difficile virulence in vitro. The recognition of conjugated BAs by BSHs defines the resulting BA pool, including the expansive MCBAs. This work provides insights into the structural basis of BSH mechanisms that shape the BA landscape and promote colonization resistance against C. difficile.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01337-7"
"nmicrobiol","Mechanosensitive extrusion of Enterovirus A71-infected cells from colonic organoids","Enterovirus A71 causes severe disease upon systemic infection, sometimes leading to life-threatening neurological dysfunction. However, in most cases infection is asymptomatic and limited to the gastrointestinal tract, where virus is amplified for transmission. Picornaviruses have previously been shown to exit infected cells via either cell lysis or secretion of vesicles. Here we report that entire Enterovirus A71-infected cells are specifically extruded from the apical surface of differentiated human colon organoids, as observed by confocal microscopy. Differential sensitivity to chemical and peptide inhibitors demonstrated that extrusion of virus-infected cells is dependent on force sensing via mechanosensitive ion channels rather than apoptotic cell death. When isolated and used as inoculum, intact virus-containing extruded cells can initiate new infections. In contrast, when mechanical force sensing is inhibited, large amounts of free virus are released. Thus, extrusion of live, virus-infected cells from intact epithelial tissue is likely to benefit both the integrity of host tissues and the protected spread of this faecal-oral pathogen within and between hosts.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01339-5"
"nmicrobiol","A hydrogenotrophic Sulfurimonas is globally abundant in deep-sea oxygen-saturated hydrothermal plumes","Members of the bacterial genus Sulfurimonas (phylum Campylobacterota) dominate microbial communities in marine redoxclines and are important for sulfur and nitrogen cycling. Here we used metagenomics and metabolic analyses to characterize a Sulfurimonas from the Gakkel Ridge in the Central Arctic Ocean and Southwest Indian Ridge, showing that this species is ubiquitous in non-buoyant hydrothermal plumes at Mid Ocean Ridges across the global ocean. One Sulfurimonas species, USulfurimonas pluma, was found to be globally abundant and active in cold (<0−4  degreesC), oxygen-saturated and hydrogen-rich hydrothermal plumes. Compared with other Sulfurimonas species, US. pluma has a reduced genome (>17%) and genomic signatures of an aerobic chemolithotrophic metabolism using hydrogen as an energy source, including acquisition of A2-type oxidase and loss of nitrate and nitrite reductases. The dominance and unique niche of US. pluma in hydrothermal plumes suggest an unappreciated biogeochemical role for Sulfurimonas in the deep ocean.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01342-w"
"nmicrobiol","Lignin deconstruction by anaerobic fungi","Lignocellulose forms plant cell walls, and its three constituent polymers, cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, represent the largest renewable organic carbon pool in the terrestrial biosphere. Insights into biological lignocellulose deconstruction inform understandings of global carbon sequestration dynamics and provide inspiration for biotechnologies seeking to address the current climate crisis by producing renewable chemicals from plant biomass. Organisms in diverse environments disassemble lignocellulose, and carbohydrate degradation processes are well defined, but biological lignin deconstruction is described only in aerobic systems. It is currently unclear whether anaerobic lignin deconstruction is impossible because of biochemical constraints or, alternatively, has not yet been measured. We applied whole cell-wall nuclear magnetic resonance, gel-permeation chromatography and transcriptome sequencing to interrogate the apparent paradox that anaerobic fungi (Neocallimastigomycetes), well-documented lignocellulose degradation specialists, are unable to modify lignin. We find that Neocallimastigomycetes anaerobically break chemical bonds in grass and hardwood lignins, and we further associate upregulated gene products with the observed lignocellulose deconstruction. These findings alter perceptions of lignin deconstruction by anaerobes and provide opportunities to advance decarbonization biotechnologies that depend on depolymerizing lignocellulose.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01336-8"
"nmicrobiol","Cytoplasmic contractile injection systems mediate cell death in Streptomyces","Contractile injection systems (CIS) are bacteriophage tail-like structures that mediate bacterial cell-cell interactions. While CIS are highly abundant across diverse bacterial phyla, representative gene clusters in Gram-positive organisms remain poorly studied. Here we characterize a CIS in the Gram-positive multicellular model organism Streptomyces coelicolor and show that, in contrast to most other CIS, S. coelicolor CIS (CISSc) mediate cell death in response to stress and impact cellular development. CISSc are expressed in the cytoplasm of vegetative hyphae and are not released into the medium. Our cryo-electron microscopy structure enabled the engineering of non-contractile and fluorescently tagged CISSc assemblies. Cryo-electron tomography showed that CISSc contraction is linked to reduced cellular integrity. Fluorescence light microscopy furthermore revealed that functional CISSc mediate cell death upon encountering different types of stress. The absence of functional CISSc had an impact on hyphal differentiation and secondary metabolite production. Finally, we identified three putative effector proteins, which when absent, phenocopied other CISSc mutants. Our results provide new functional insights into CIS in Gram-positive organisms and a framework for studying novel intracellular roles, including regulated cell death and life-cycle progression in multicellular bacteria.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01341-x"
"nmicrobiol","Mycobacterial nucleoid-associated protein Lsr2 is required for productive mycobacteriophage infection","Mycobacteriophages are a diverse group of viruses infecting Mycobacterium with substantial therapeutic potential. However, as this potential becomes realized, the molecular details of phage infection and mechanisms of resistance remain ill-defined. Here we use live-cell fluorescence microscopy to visualize the spatiotemporal dynamics of mycobacteriophage infection in single cells and populations, showing that infection is dependent on the host nucleoid-associated Lsr2 protein. Mycobacteriophages preferentially adsorb at Mycobacterium smegmatis sites of new cell wall synthesis and following DNA injection, Lsr2 reorganizes away from host replication foci to establish zones of phage DNA replication (ZOPR). Cells lacking Lsr2 proceed through to cell lysis when infected but fail to generate consecutive phage bursts that trigger epidemic spread of phage particles to neighbouring cells. Many mycobacteriophages code for their own Lsr2-related proteins, and although their roles are unknown, they do not rescue the loss of host Lsr2.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01333-x"

Understanding their complex cell architecture and life cycle is challenging because, as with most eukaryotic microbes, ~50% of genome-encoded proteins have completely unknown functions. Here, using fluorescence microscopy and cell lines expressing endogenously tagged proteins, we mapped the subcellular localization of 89% of the T. brucei proteome, a resource we call TrypTag. We provide clues to function and define lineage-specific organelle adaptations for parasitism, mapping the ultraconserved cellular architecture of eukaryotes, including the first comprehensive 'cartographic' analysis of the eukaryotic flagellum, which is vital for morphogenesis and pathology. To demonstrate the power of this resource, we identify novel organelle subdomains and changes in molecular composition through the cell cycle. TrypTag is a transformative resource, important for hypothesis generation for both eukaryotic evolutionary molecular cell biology and fundamental parasite cell biology.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01295-6"
"nmicrobiol","Metabolic heterogeneity and cross-feeding within isogenic yeast populations captured by DILAC","Genetically identical cells are known to differ in many physiological parameters such as growth rate and drug tolerance. Metabolic specialization is believed to be a cause of such phenotypic heterogeneity, but detection of metabolically divergent subpopulations remains technically challenging. We developed a proteomics-based technology, termed differential isotope labelling by amino acids (DILAC), that can detect producer and consumer subpopulations of a particular amino acid within an isogenic cell population by monitoring peptides with multiple occurrences of the amino acid. We reveal that young, morphologically undifferentiated yeast colonies contain subpopulations of lysine producers and consumers that emerge due to nutrient gradients. Deconvoluting their proteomes using DILAC, we find evidence for in situ cross-feeding where rapidly growing cells ferment and provide the more slowly growing, respiring cells with ethanol. Finally, by combining DILAC with fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we show that the metabolic subpopulations diverge phenotypically, as exemplified by a different tolerance to the antifungal drug amphotericin B. Overall, DILAC captures previously unnoticed metabolic heterogeneity and provides experimental evidence for the role of metabolic specialization and cross-feeding interactions as a source of phenotypic heterogeneity in isogenic cell populations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01304-8"
"nmicrobiol","Genetic mapping of microbial and host traits reveals production of immunomodulatory lipids by Akkermansia muciniphila in the murine gut","The molecular bases of how host genetic variation impacts the gut microbiome remain largely unknown. Here we used a genetically diverse mouse population and applied systems genetics strategies to identify interactions between host and microbe phenotypes including microbial functions, using faecal metagenomics, small intestinal transcripts and caecal lipids that influence microbe-host dynamics. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping identified murine genomic regions associated with variations in bacterial taxa; bacterial functions including motility, sporulation and lipopolysaccharide production and levels of bacterial- and host-derived lipids. We found overlapping QTL for the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and caecal levels of ornithine lipids. Follow-up in vitro and in vivo studies revealed that A. muciniphila is a major source of these lipids in the gut, provided evidence that ornithine lipids have immunomodulatory effects and identified intestinal transcripts co-regulated with these traits including Atf3, which encodes for a transcription factor that plays vital roles in modulating metabolism and immunity. Collectively, these results suggest that ornithine lipids are potentially important for A. muciniphila-host interactions and support the role of host genetics as a determinant of responses to gut microbes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01326-w"
"nmicrobiol","Characterization of antibiotic resistomes by reprogrammed bacteriophage-enabled functional metagenomics in clinical strains","Functional metagenomics is a powerful experimental tool to identify antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the environment, but the range of suitable host bacterial species is limited. This limitation affects both the scope of the identified ARGs and the interpretation of their clinical relevance. Here we present a functional metagenomics pipeline called Reprogrammed Bacteriophage Particle Assisted Multi-species Functional Metagenomics (DEEPMINE). This approach combines and improves the use of T7 bacteriophage with exchanged tail fibres and targeted mutagenesis to expand phage host-specificity and efficiency for functional metagenomics. These modified phage particles were used to introduce large metagenomic plasmid libraries into clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. By screening for ARGs in soil and gut microbiomes and clinical genomes against 13 antibiotics, we demonstrate that this approach substantially expands the list of identified ARGs. Many ARGs have species-specific effects on resistance; they provide a high level of resistance in one bacterial species but yield very limited resistance in a related species. Finally, we identified mobile ARGs against antibiotics that are currently under clinical development or have recently been approved. Overall, DEEPMINE expands the functional metagenomics toolbox for studying microbial communities.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01320-2"
"nmicrobiol","Molecular hydrogen in seawater supports growth of diverse marine bacteria","Molecular hydrogen (H2) is an abundant and readily accessible energy source in marine systems, but it remains unknown whether marine microbial communities consume this gas. Here we use a suite of approaches to show that marine bacteria consume H2 to support growth. Genes for H2-uptake hydrogenases are prevalent in global ocean metagenomes, highly expressed in metatranscriptomes and found across eight bacterial phyla. Capacity for H2 oxidation increases with depth and decreases with oxygen concentration, suggesting that H2 is important in environments with low primary production. Biogeochemical measurements of tropical, temperate and subantarctic waters, and axenic cultures show that marine microbes consume H2 supplied at environmentally relevant concentrations, yielding enough cell-specific power to support growth in bacteria with low energy requirements. Conversely, our results indicate that oxidation of carbon monoxide (CO) primarily supports survival. Altogether, H2 is a notable energy source for marine bacteria and may influence oceanic ecology and biogeochemistry.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-023-01322-0"
"nmicrobiol","L-form conversion in Gram-positive bacteria enables escape from phage infection","At the end of a lytic bacteriophage replication cycle in Gram-positive bacteria, peptidoglycan-degrading endolysins that cause explosive cell lysis of the host can also attack non-infected bystander cells. Here we show that in osmotically stabilized environments, Listeria monocytogenes can evade phage predation by transient conversion to a cell wall-deficient L-form state. This L-form escape is triggered by endolysins disintegrating the cell wall from without, leading to turgor-driven extrusion of wall-deficient, yet viable L-form cells. Remarkably, in the absence of phage predation, we show that L-forms can quickly revert to the walled state. These findings suggest that L-form conversion represents a population-level persistence mechanism to evade complete eradication by phage attack. Importantly, we also demonstrate phage-mediated L-form switching of the urinary tract pathogen Enterococcus faecalis in human urine, which underscores that this escape route may be widespread and has important implications for phage- and endolysin-based therapeutic interventions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01317-3"
"nmicrobiol","CD8+ lymphocytes do not impact SIV reservoir establishment under ART","Persistence of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) latent reservoir in infected individuals remains a problem despite fully suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). While reservoir formation begins during acute infection, the mechanisms responsible for its establishment remain unclear. CD8+ T cells are important during the initial control of viral replication. Here we examined the effect of CD8+ T cells on formation of the latent reservoir in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques by performing experimental CD8+ depletion either before infection or before early (that is, day 14 post-infection) ART initiation. We found that CD8+ depletion resulted in slower decline of viremia, indicating that CD8+ lymphocytes reduce the average lifespan of productively infected cells during acute infection and early ART, presumably through SIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity. However, CD8+ depletion did not change the frequency of infected CD4+ T cells in the blood or lymph node as measured by the total cell-associated viral DNA or intact provirus DNA assay. In addition, the size of the persistent reservoir remained the same when measuring the kinetics of virus rebound after ART interruption. These data indicate that during early SIV infection, the viral reservoir that persists under ART is established largely independent of CTL control.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01311-9"

The diversity, ecology and evolution of ANME-1 remain poorly understood. In this study, we use metagenomics on deep-sea hydrothermal samples to expand ANME-1 diversity and uncover the effect of virus-host dynamics. Phylogenetic analyses reveal a deep-branching, thermophilic family, 'Candidatus Methanospirareceae', closely related to short-chain alkane oxidizers. Global phylogeny and near-complete genomes show that hydrogen metabolism within ANME-1 is an ancient trait that was vertically inherited but differentially lost during lineage diversification. Metagenomics also uncovered 16 undescribed virus families so far exclusively targeting ANME-1 archaea, showing unique structural and replicative signatures. The expansive ANME-1 virome contains a metabolic gene repertoire that can influence host ecology and evolution through virus-mediated gene displacement. Our results suggest an evolutionary continuum between anaerobic methane and short-chain alkane oxidizers and underscore the effects of viruses on the dynamics and evolution of methane-driven ecosystems.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01297-4"
"nmicrobiol","Preterm birth is associated with xenobiotics and predicted by the vaginal metabolome","Spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, yet its prevention and early risk stratification are limited. Previous investigations have suggested that vaginal microbes and metabolites may be implicated in sPTB. Here we performed untargeted metabolomics on 232 second-trimester vaginal samples, 80 from pregnancies ending preterm. We find multiple associations between vaginal metabolites and subsequent preterm birth, and propose that several of these metabolites, including diethanolamine and ethyl glucoside, are exogenous. We observe associations between the metabolome and microbiome profiles previously obtained using 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing, including correlations between bacteria considered suboptimal, such as Gardnerella vaginalis, and metabolites enriched in term pregnancies, such as tyramine. We investigate these associations using metabolic models. We use machine learning models to predict sPTB risk from metabolite levels, weeks to months before birth, with good accuracy (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78). These models, which we validate using two external cohorts, are more accurate than microbiome-based and maternal covariates-based models (area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.55-0.59). Our results demonstrate the potential of vaginal metabolites as early biomarkers of sPTB and highlight exogenous exposures as potential risk factors for prematurity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01293-8"
"nmicrobiol","Differential carbon utilization enables co-existence of recently speciated Campylobacteraceae in the cow rumen epithelial microbiome","The activities of different microbes in the cow rumen have been shown to modulate the host's ability to utilize plant biomass, while the host-rumen interface has received little attention. As datasets collected worldwide have pointed to Campylobacteraceae as particularly abundant members of the rumen epithelial microbiome, we targeted this group in a subset of seven cows with meta- and isolate genome analysis. We show that the dominant Campylobacteraceae lineage has recently speciated into two populations that were structured by genome-wide selective sweeps followed by population-specific gene import and recombination. These processes led to differences in gene expression and enzyme domain composition that correspond to the ability to utilize acetate, the main carbon source for the host, at the cost of inhibition by propionate. This trade-off in competitive ability further manifests itself in differential dynamics of the two populations in vivo. By exploring population-level adaptations that otherwise remain cryptic in culture-independent analyses, our results highlight how recent evolutionary dynamics can shape key functional roles in the rumen microbiome.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01300-y"
"nmicrobiol","Prediction of effector protein structures from fungal phytopathogens enables evolutionary analyses","Elucidating the similarity and diversity of pathogen effectors is critical to understand their evolution across fungal phytopathogens. However, rapid divergence that diminishes sequence similarities between putatively homologous effectors has largely concealed the roots of effector evolution. Here we modelled the structures of 26,653 secreted proteins from 14 agriculturally important fungal phytopathogens, six non-pathogenic fungi and one oomycete with AlphaFold 2. With 18,000 successfully predicted folds, we performed structure-guided comparative analyses on two aspects of effector evolution: uniquely expanded sequence-unrelated structurally similar (SUSS) effector families and common folds present across the fungal species. Extreme expansion of lineage-specific SUSS effector families was found only in several obligate biotrophs, Blumeria graminis and Puccinia graminis. The highly expanded effector families were the source of conserved sequence motifs, such as the Y/F/WxC motif. We identified new classes of SUSS effector families that include known virulence factors, such as AvrSr35, AvrSr50 and Tin2. Structural comparisons revealed that the expanded structural folds further diversify through domain duplications and fusion with disordered stretches. Putatively sub- and neo-functionalized SUSS effectors could reconverge on regulation, expanding the functional pools of effectors in the pathogen infection cycle. We also found evidence that many effector families could have originated from ancestral folds conserved across fungi. Collectively, our study highlights diverse effector evolution mechanisms and supports divergent evolution as a major force in driving SUSS effector evolution from ancestral proteins.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01287-6"

However, other members of the Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydiae superphylum are primarily free living. How Chlamydiae transitioned to an endosymbiotic lifestyle is still largely unresolved. Here we reconstructed Planctomycetes-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydiae species relationships and modelled superphylum genome evolution. Gene content reconstruction from 11,996 gene families suggests a motile and facultatively anaerobic last common Chlamydiae ancestor that had already gained characteristic endosymbiont genes. Counter to expectations for genome streamlining in strict endosymbionts, we detected substantial gene gain within Chlamydiae. We found that divergence in energy metabolism and aerobiosis observed in extant lineages emerged later during chlamydial evolution. In particular, metabolic and aerobic genes characteristic of the more metabolically versatile protist-infecting chlamydiae were gained, such as respiratory chain complexes. Our results show that metabolic complexity can increase during endosymbiont evolution, adding an additional perspective for understanding symbiont evolutionary trajectories across the tree of life.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01284-9"

We sequenced the meta-transcriptomes of 31 different tick species in the Ixodidae and Argasidae families from across mainland China, and identified 724 RNA viruses with distinctive virome compositions among genera. A total of 1,801 assembled and complete or nearly complete viral genomes revealed an extensive diversity of genome architectures of tick-associated viruses, highlighting ticks as a reservoir of RNA viruses. We examined the phylogenies of different virus families to investigate virome evolution and found that the most diverse tick-associated viruses are positive-strand RNA virus families that demonstrate more ancient divergence than other arboviruses. Tick-specific viruses are often associated with only a few tick species, whereas virus clades that can infect vertebrates are found in a wider range of tick species. We hypothesize that tick viruses can exhibit both 'specialist' and 'generalist' evolutionary trends. We hope that our virome dataset will enable much-needed research on vertebrate-pathogenic tick-associated viruses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01275-w"

Here we present a multi-omics analysis of a diverse set of 880 microbial community samples collected for the Earth Microbiome Project. We include amplicon (16S, 18S, ITS) and shotgun metagenomic sequence data, and untargeted metabolomics data (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and gas chromatography mass spectrometry). We used standardized protocols and analytical methods to characterize microbial communities, focusing on relationships and co-occurrences of microbially related metabolites and microbial taxa across environments, thus allowing us to explore diversity at extraordinary scale. In addition to a reference database for metagenomic and metabolomic data, we provide a framework for incorporating additional studies, enabling the expansion of existing knowledge in the form of an evolving community resource. We demonstrate the utility of this database by testing the hypothesis that every microbe and metabolite is everywhere but the environment selects. Our results show that metabolite diversity exhibits turnover and nestedness related to both microbial communities and the environment, whereas the relative abundances of microbially related metabolites vary and co-occur with specific microbial consortia in a habitat-specific manner. We additionally show the power of certain chemistry, in particular terpenoids, in distinguishing Earth's environments (for example, terrestrial plant surfaces and soils, freshwater and marine animal stool), as well as that of certain microbes including Conexibacter woesei (terrestrial soils), Haloquadratum walsbyi (marine deposits) and Pantoea dispersa (terrestrial plant detritus). This Resource provides insight into the taxa and metabolites within microbial communities from diverse habitats across Earth, informing both microbial and chemical ecology, and provides a foundation and methods for multi-omics microbiome studies of hosts and the environment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01266-x"

Many species are opportunistic pathogens and can harbour diverse classes of antimicrobial resistance genes. Healthcare-associated Klebsiella pneumoniae clones that are non-susceptible to carbapenems can spread rapidly, representing a high public health burden. Here we report an analysis of 3,482 genome sequences representing 15 Klebsiella species sampled over a 17-month period from a wide range of clinical, community, animal and environmental settings in and around the Italian city of Pavia. Northern Italy is a hotspot for hospital-acquired carbapenem non-susceptible Klebsiella and thus a pertinent setting to examine the overlap between isolates in clinical and non-clinical settings. We found no genotypic or phenotypic evidence for non-susceptibility to carbapenems outside the clinical environment. Although we noted occasional transmission between clinical and non-clinical settings, our data point to a limited role of animal and environmental reservoirs in the human acquisition of Klebsiella spp. We also provide a detailed genus-wide view of genomic diversity and population structure, including the identification of new groups.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01263-0"
"nmicrobiol","PCRCR complex is essential for invasion of human erythrocytes by Plasmodium falciparum","The most severe form of malaria is caused by Plasmodium falciparum. These parasites invade human erythrocytes, and an essential step in this process involves the ligand PfRh5, which forms a complex with cysteine-rich protective antigen (CyRPA) and PfRh5-interacting protein (PfRipr) (RCR complex) and binds basigin on the host cell. We identified a heteromeric disulfide-linked complex consisting of P. falciparum Plasmodium thrombospondin-related apical merozoite protein (PfPTRAMP) and P. falciparum cysteine-rich small secreted protein (PfCSS) and have shown that it binds RCR to form a pentameric complex, PCRCR. Using P. falciparum lines with conditional knockouts, invasion inhibitory nanobodies to both PfPTRAMP and PfCSS, and lattice light-sheet microscopy, we show that they are essential for merozoite invasion. The PCRCR complex functions to anchor the contact between merozoite and erythrocyte membranes brought together by strong parasite deformations. We solved the structure of nanobody-PfCSS complexes to identify an inhibitory epitope. Our results define the function of the PCRCR complex and identify invasion neutralizing epitopes providing a roadmap for structure-guided development of these proteins for a blood stage malaria vaccine.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01261-2"

Using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen, we identified the host SMC5/6 complex as essential for this epigenetic silencing. We show that SMC5/6 binds to and then SUMOylates unintegrated chromatinized HIV-1 DNA. Inhibition of SUMOylation, either by point mutagenesis of the SMC5/6 component NSMCE2-a SUMO E3 ligase-or using the SUMOylation inhibitor TAK-981, prevents epigenetic silencing, enables transcription from unintegrated HIV-1 DNA and rescues the replication of integrase-deficient HIV-1. Finally, we show that blocking SMC5/6 complex expression, or inhibiting its SUMOylation activity, suppresses the establishment of latent HIV-1 infections in both CD4+ T cell lines and primary human T cells. Collectively, our data show that the SMC5/6 complex plays a direct role in mediating the establishment of HIV-1 latency by epigenetically silencing integration-competent HIV-1 proviruses before integration.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01264-z"
"nmicrobiol","Divergent SARS-CoV-2 variant emerges in white-tailed deer with deer-to-human transmission","Wildlife reservoirs of broad-host-range viruses have the potential to enable evolution of viral variants that can emerge to infect humans. In North America, there is phylogenomic evidence of continual transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from humans to white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) through unknown means, but no evidence of transmission from deer to humans. We carried out an observational surveillance study in Ontario, Canada during November and December 2021 (n = 300 deer) and identified a highly divergent lineage of SARS-CoV-2 in white-tailed deer (B.1.641). This lineage is one of the most divergent SARS-CoV-2 lineages identified so far, with 76 mutations (including 37 previously associated with non-human mammalian hosts). From a set of five complete and two partial deer-derived viral genomes we applied phylogenomic, recombination, selection and mutation spectrum analyses, which provided evidence for evolution and transmission in deer and a shared ancestry with mink-derived virus. Our analysis also revealed an epidemiologically linked human infection. Taken together, our findings provide evidence for sustained evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in white-tailed deer and of deer-to-human transmission.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01268-9"
"nmicrobiol","Single-cell measurements and modelling reveal substantial organic carbon acquisition by Prochlorococcus","Marine phytoplankton are responsible for about half of the photosynthesis on Earth. Many are mixotrophs, combining photosynthesis with heterotrophic assimilation of organic carbon, but the relative contribution of these two lifestyles is unclear. Here single-cell measurements reveal that Prochlorococcus at the base of the photic zone in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea obtain only ~20% of carbon required for growth by photosynthesis. This is supported by laboratory-calibrated calculations based on photo-physiology parameters and compared with in situ growth rates. Agent-based simulations show that mixotrophic cells could grow tens of metres deeper than obligate photo-autotrophs, deepening the nutricline by ~20 m. Time series from the North Atlantic and North Pacific indicate that, during thermal stratification, on average 8-10% of the Prochlorococcus cells live without enough light to sustain obligate photo-autotrophic populations. Together, these results suggest that mixotrophy underpins the ecological success of a large fraction of the global Prochlorococcus population and its collective genetic diversity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01250-5"
"nmicrobiol","Broad-spectrum CRISPR-Cas13a enables efficient phage genome editing","CRISPR-Cas13 proteins are RNA-guided RNA nucleases that defend against incoming RNA and DNA phages by binding to complementary target phage transcripts followed by general, non-specific RNA degradation. Here we analysed the defensive capabilities of LbuCas13a from Leptotrichia buccalis and found it to have robust antiviral activity unaffected by target phage gene essentiality, gene expression timing or target sequence location. Furthermore, we find LbuCas13a antiviral activity to be broadly effective against a wide range of phages by challenging LbuCas13a against nine E. coli phages from diverse phylogenetic groups. Leveraging the versatility and potency enabled by LbuCas13a targeting, we applied LbuCas13a towards broad-spectrum phage editing. Using a two-step phage-editing and enrichment method, we achieved seven markerless genome edits in three diverse phages with 100% efficiency, including edits as large as multi-gene deletions and as small as replacing a single codon. Cas13a can be applied as a generalizable tool for editing the most abundant and diverse biological entities on Earth.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01258-x"
"nmicrobiol","Enterotoxin tilimycin from gut-resident Klebsiella promotes mutational evolution and antibiotic resistance in mice","Klebsiella spp. that secrete the DNA-alkylating enterotoxin tilimycin colonize the human intestinal tract. Numbers of toxigenic bacteria increase during antibiotic use, and the resulting accumulation of tilimycin in the intestinal lumen damages the epithelium via genetic instability and apoptosis. Here we examine the impact of this genotoxin on the gut ecosystem. 16S rRNA sequencing of faecal samples from mice colonized with Klebsiella oxytoca strains and mechanistic analyses show that tilimycin is a pro-mutagenic antibiotic affecting multiple phyla. Transient synthesis of tilimycin in the murine gut antagonized niche competitors, reduced microbial richness and altered taxonomic composition of the microbiota both during and following exposure. Moreover, tilimycin secretion increased rates of mutagenesis in co-resident opportunistic pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, as shown by de novo acquisition of antibiotic resistance. We conclude that tilimycin is a bacterial mutagen, and flares of genotoxic Klebsiella have the potential to drive the emergence of resistance, destabilize the gut microbiota and shape its evolutionary trajectory.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01260-3"
"nmicrobiol","Evasion of cGAS and TRIM5 defines pandemic HIV","Of the 13 known independent zoonoses of simian immunodeficiency viruses to humans, only one, leading to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1(M) has become pandemic, causing over 80 million human infections. To understand the specific features associated with pandemic human-to-human HIV spread, we compared replication of HIV-1(M) with non-pandemic HIV-(O) and HIV-2 strains in myeloid cell models. We found that non-pandemic HIV lineages replicate less well than HIV-1(M) owing to activation of cGAS and TRIM5-mediated antiviral responses. We applied phylogenetic and X-ray crystallography structural analyses to identify differences between pandemic and non-pandemic HIV capsids. We found that genetic reversal of two specific amino acid adaptations in HIV-1(M) enables activation of TRIM5, cGAS and innate immune responses. We propose a model in which the parental lineage of pandemic HIV-1(M) evolved a capsid that prevents cGAS and TRIM5 triggering, thereby allowing silent replication in myeloid cells. We hypothesize that this capsid adaptation promotes human-to-human spread through avoidance of innate immune response activation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01247-0"
"nmicrobiol","Growth temperature and chromatinization in archaea","DNA in cells is associated with proteins that constrain its structure and affect DNA-templated processes including transcription and replication. HU and histones are the main constituents of chromatin in bacteria and eukaryotes, respectively, with few exceptions. Archaea, in contrast, have diverse repertoires of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). To analyse the evolutionary and ecological drivers of this diversity, we combined a phylogenomic survey of known and predicted NAPs with quantitative proteomic data. We identify the Diaforarchaea as a hotbed of NAP gain and loss, and experimentally validate candidate NAPs in two members of this clade, Thermoplasma volcanium and Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis. Proteomic analysis across a diverse sample of 19 archaea revealed that NAP investment varies from <0.03% to >5% of total protein. This variation is predicted by growth temperature. We propose that high levels of chromatinization have evolved as a mechanism to prevent uncontrolled helix denaturation at higher temperatures, with implications for the origin of chromatin in both archaea and eukaryotes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01245-2"

We assigned patients into sepsis groups on the basis of clinical and microbiological criteria. From whole-blood gene expression data, we distinguished patients with sepsis from patients with non-infectious systemic inflammatory conditions using a trained bagged support vector machine (bSVM) classifier (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.81 in the training set; AUC = 0.82 in a held-out validation set). Plasma RNA also yielded a transcriptional signature of sepsis with several genes previously reported as sepsis biomarkers, and a bSVM sepsis diagnostic classifier (AUC = 0.97 training set; AUC = 0.77 validation set). Pathogen detection performance of plasma mNGS varied on the basis of pathogen and site of infection. To improve detection of virus, we developed a secondary transcriptomic classifier (AUC = 0.94 training set; AUC = 0.96 validation set). We combined host and microbial features to develop an integrated sepsis diagnostic model that identified 99% of microbiologically confirmed sepsis cases, and predicted sepsis in 74% of suspected and 89% of indeterminate sepsis cases. In summary, we suggest that integrating host transcriptional profiling and broad-range metagenomic pathogen detection from nucleic acid is a promising tool for sepsis diagnosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01237-2"
"nmicrobiol","Diverse MarR bacterial regulators of auxin catabolism in the plant microbiome","Chemical signalling in the plant microbiome can have drastic effects on microbial community structure, and on host growth and development. Previously, we demonstrated that the auxin metabolic signal interference performed by the bacterial genus Variovorax via an auxin degradation locus was essential for maintaining stereotypic root development in an ecologically relevant bacterial synthetic community. Here, we dissect the Variovorax auxin degradation locus to define the genes iadDE as necessary and sufficient for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) degradation and signal interference. We determine the crystal structures and binding properties of the operon's MarR-family repressor with IAA and other auxins. Auxin degradation operons were identified across the bacterial tree of life and we define two distinct types on the basis of gene content and metabolic products: iac-like and iad-like. The structures of MarRs from representatives of each auxin degradation operon type establish that each has distinct IAA-binding pockets. Comparison of representative IAA-degrading strains from diverse bacterial genera colonizing Arabidopsis plants show that while all degrade IAA, only strains containing iad-like auxin-degrading operons interfere with auxin signalling in a complex synthetic community context. This suggests that iad-like operon-containing bacterial strains, including Variovorax species, play a key ecological role in modulating auxins in the plant microbiome.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01244-3"
"nmicrobiol","CRISPR-based oligo recombineering prioritizes apicomplexan cysteines for drug discovery","Nucleophilic amino acids are important in covalent drug development yet underutilized as anti-microbial targets. Chemoproteomic technologies have been developed to mine chemically accessible residues via their intrinsic reactivity towards electrophilic probes but cannot discern which chemically reactive sites contribute to protein function and should therefore be prioritized for drug discovery. To address this, we have developed a CRISPR-based oligo recombineering (CORe) platform to support the rapid identification, functional prioritization and rational targeting of chemically reactive sites in haploid systems. Our approach couples protein sequence and function with biological fitness of live cells. Here we profile the electrophile sensitivity of proteinogenic cysteines in the eukaryotic pathogen Toxoplasma gondii and prioritize functional sites using CORe. Electrophile-sensitive cysteines decorating the ribosome were found to be critical for parasite growth, with target-based screening identifying a parasite-selective anti-malarial lead molecule and validating the apicomplexan translation machinery as a target for ongoing covalent ligand development.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01249-y"
"nmicrobiol","Pneumococcal within-host diversity during colonization, transmission and treatment","Characterizing the genetic diversity of pathogens within the host promises to greatly improve surveillance and reconstruction of transmission chains. For bacteria, it also informs our understanding of inter-strain competition and how this shapes the distribution of resistant and sensitive bacteria. Here we study the genetic diversity of Streptococcus pneumoniae within 468 infants and 145 of their mothers by deep sequencing whole pneumococcal populations from 3,761 longitudinal nasopharyngeal samples. We demonstrate that deep sequencing has unsurpassed sensitivity for detecting multiple colonization, doubling the rate at which highly invasive serotype 1 bacteria were detected in carriage compared with gold-standard methods. The greater resolution identified an elevated rate of transmission from mothers to their children in the first year of the child's life. Comprehensive treatment data demonstrated that infants were at an elevated risk of both the acquisition and persistent colonization of a multidrug-resistant bacterium following antimicrobial treatment. Some alleles were enriched after antimicrobial treatment, suggesting that they aided persistence, but generally purifying selection dominated within-host evolution. Rates of co-colonization imply that in the absence of treatment, susceptible lineages outcompeted resistant lineages within the host. These results demonstrate the many benefits of deep sequencing for the genomic surveillance of bacterial pathogens.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01238-1"
"nmicrobiol","Strain-specific impacts of probiotics are a significant driver of gut microbiome development in very preterm infants","The development of the gut microbiome from birth plays important roles in short- and long-term health, but factors influencing preterm gut microbiome development are poorly understood. In the present study, we use metagenomic sequencing to analyse 1,431 longitudinal stool samples from 123 very preterm infants (<32 weeks' gestation) who did not develop intestinal disease or sepsis over a study period of 10 years. During the study period, one cohort had no probiotic exposure whereas two cohorts were given different probiotic products: Infloran (Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus) or Labinic (B. bifidum, B. longum subsp. infantis and L. acidophilus). Mothers' own milk, breast milk fortifier, antibiotics and probiotics were significantly associated with the gut microbiome, with probiotics being the most significant factor. Probiotics drove microbiome transition into different preterm gut community types (PGCTs), each enriched in a different Bifidobacterium sp. and significantly associated with increased postnatal age. Functional analyses identified stool metabolites associated with PGCTs and, in preterm-derived organoids, sterile faecal supernatants impacted intestinal, organoid monolayer, gene expression in a PGCT-specific manner. The present study identifies specific influencers of gut microbiome development in very preterm infants, some of which overlap with those impacting term infants. The results highlight the importance of strain-specific differences in probiotic products and their impact on host interactions in the preterm gut.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01213-w"
"nmicrobiol","SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants evade population antibody response by mutations in a single spike epitope","Population antibody response is thought to be important in selection of virus variants. We report that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits a population immune response that is mediated by a lineage of VH1-69 germline antibodies. A representative antibody R1-32 from this lineage was isolated. By cryo-EM, we show that it targets a semi-cryptic epitope in the spike receptor-binding domain. Binding to this non-ACE2 competing epitope results in spike destruction, thereby inhibiting virus entry. On the basis of epitope location, neutralization mechanism and analysis of antibody binding to spike variants, we propose that recurrent substitutions at 452 and 490 are associated with immune evasion of the identified population antibody response. These substitutions, including L452R (present in the Delta variant), disrupt interactions mediated by the VH1-69-specific hydrophobic HCDR2 to impair antibody-antigen association, enabling variants to escape. The first Omicron variants were sensitive to antibody R1-32 but subvariants that harbour L452R quickly emerged and spread. Our results provide insights into how SARS-CoV-2 variants emerge and evade host immune responses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01235-4"
"nmicrobiol","A functional selection reveals previously undetected anti-phage defence systems in the E. coli pangenome","The ancient, ongoing coevolutionary battle between bacteria and their viruses, bacteriophages, has given rise to sophisticated immune systems including restriction-modification and CRISPR-Cas. Many additional anti-phage systems have been identified using computational approaches based on genomic co-location within defence islands, but these screens may not be exhaustive. Here we developed an experimental selection scheme agnostic to genomic context to identify defence systems in 71 diverse E. coli strains. Our results unveil 21 conserved defence systems, none of which were previously detected as enriched in defence islands. Additionally, our work indicates that intact prophages and mobile genetic elements are primary reservoirs and distributors of defence systems in E. coli, with defence systems typically carried in specific locations or hotspots. These hotspots encode dozens of additional uncharacterized defence system candidates. Our findings reveal an extended landscape of antiviral immunity in E. coli and provide an approach for mapping defence systems in other species.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01219-4"

This code enables valid publication of names of prokaryotes based upon isolate genome, metagenome-assembled genome or single-amplified genome sequences. Otherwise, it is similar to the ICNP with regard to the formation of names and rules of priority. It operates through the SeqCode Registry (https://seqco.de/), a registration portal through which names and nomenclatural types are registered, validated and linked to metadata. We describe the two paths currently available within SeqCode to register and validate names, including Candidatus names, and provide examples for both. Recommendations on minimal standards for DNA sequences are provided. Thus, the SeqCode provides a reproducible and objective framework for the nomenclature of all prokaryotes regardless of cultivability and facilitates communication across microbiological disciplines.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01214-9"
"nmicrobiol","Pseudomonas putida mediates bacterial killing, biofilm invasion and biocontrol with a type IVB secretion system","Many bacteria utilize contact-dependent killing machineries to eliminate rivals in their environmental niches. Here we show that the plant root colonizer Pseudomonas putida strain IsoF is able to kill a wide range of soil and plant-associated Gram-negative bacteria with the aid of a type IVB secretion system (T4BSS) that delivers a toxic effector into bacterial competitors in a contact-dependent manner. This extends the range of targets of T4BSSs-so far thought to transfer effectors only into eukaryotic cells-to prokaryotes. Bioinformatic and genetic analyses showed that this killing machine is entirely encoded by the kib gene cluster located within a rare genomic island, which was recently acquired by horizontal gene transfer. P. putida IsoF utilizes this secretion system not only as a defensive weapon to kill bacterial competitors but also as an offensive weapon to invade existing biofilms, allowing the strain to persist in its natural environment. Furthermore, we show that strain IsoF can protect tomato plants against the phytopathogen Ralstonia solanacearum in a T4BSS-dependent manner, suggesting that IsoF can be exploited for pest control and sustainable agriculture.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01209-6"

Here, leveraging the observation that many subjects are decolonized without interventions within a year, we used longitudinal shotgun metagenomics (up to 12 timepoints) for detailed characterization of ecological and evolutionary dynamics in the gut microbiome of a cohort of CPE-colonized subjects and family members (n = 46; 361 samples). Subjects who underwent decolonization exhibited a distinct ecological shift marked by recovery of microbial diversity, key commensals and anti-inflammatory pathways. In addition, colonization was marked by elevated but unstable Enterobacteriaceae abundances, which exhibited distinct strain-level dynamics for different species (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). Finally, comparative analysis with whole-genome sequencing data from CPE isolates (n = 159) helped identify substrain variation in key functional genes and the presence of highly similar E. coli and K. pneumoniae strains with variable resistance profiles and plasmid sharing. These results provide an enhanced view into how colonization by multi-drug-resistant bacteria associates with altered gut ecology and can enable transfer of resistance genes, even in the absence of overt infection and antibiotic usage.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01221-w"
"nmicrobiol","A bacterial pan-genome makes gene essentiality strain-dependent and evolvable","Many bacterial species are represented by a pan-genome, whose genetic repertoire far outstrips that of any single bacterial genome. Here we investigate how a bacterial pan-genome might influence gene essentiality and whether essential genes that are initially critical for the survival of an organism can evolve to become non-essential. By using Transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq), whole-genome sequencing and RNA-seq on a set of 36 clinical Streptococcus pneumoniae strains representative of >68% of the species' pan-genome, we identify a species-wide 'essentialome' that can be subdivided into universal, core strain-specific and accessory essential genes. By employing 'forced-evolution experiments', we show that specific genetic changes allow bacteria to bypass essentiality. Moreover, by untangling several genetic mechanisms, we show that gene essentiality can be highly influenced by and/or be dependent on: (1) the composition of the accessory genome, (2) the accumulation of toxic intermediates, (3) functional redundancy, (4) efficient recycling of critical metabolites and (5) pathway rewiring. While this functional characterization underscores the evolvability potential of many essential genes, we also show that genes with differential essentiality remain important antimicrobial drug target candidates, as their inactivation almost always has a severe fitness cost in vivo.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01208-7"
"nmicrobiol","Cell wall synthesis and remodelling dynamics determine division site architecture and cell shape in Escherichia coli","The bacterial division apparatus catalyses the synthesis and remodelling of septal peptidoglycan (sPG) to build the cell wall layer that fortifies the daughter cell poles. Understanding of this essential process has been limited by the lack of native three-dimensional views of developing septa. Here, we apply state-of-the-art cryogenic electron tomography (cryo-ET) and fluorescence microscopy to visualize the division site architecture and sPG biogenesis dynamics of the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. We identify a wedge-like sPG structure that fortifies the ingrowing septum. Experiments with strains defective in sPG biogenesis revealed that the septal architecture and mode of division can be modified to more closely resemble that of other Gram-negative (Caulobacter crescentus) or Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria, suggesting that a conserved mechanism underlies the formation of different septal morphologies. Finally, analysis of mutants impaired in amidase activation (ΔenvC ΔnlpD) showed that cell wall remodelling affects the placement and stability of the cytokinetic ring. Taken together, our results support a model in which competition between the cell elongation and division machineries determines the shape of cell constrictions and the poles they form. They also highlight how the activity of the division system can be modulated to help generate the diverse array of shapes observed in the bacterial domain.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01210-z"
"nmicrobiol","Rational attenuation of RNA viruses with zinc finger antiviral protein","Attenuation of a virulent virus is a proven approach for generating vaccines but can be unpredictable. For example, synonymous recoding of viral genomes can attenuate replication but sometimes results in pleiotropic effects that confound rational vaccine design. To enable specific, conditional attenuation of viruses, we examined target RNA features that enable zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) function. ZAP recognized CpG dinucleotides and targeted CpG-rich RNAs for depletion, but RNA features such as CpG numbers, spacing and surrounding nucleotide composition that enable specific modulation by ZAP were undefined. Using synonymously mutated HIV-1 genomes, we defined several sequence features that govern ZAP sensitivity and enable stable attenuation. We applied rules derived from experiments with HIV-1 to engineer a mutant enterovirus A71 genome whose attenuation was stable and strictly ZAP-dependent, both in cell culture and in mice. The conditionally attenuated enterovirus A71 mutant elicited neutralizing antibodies that were protective against wild-type enterovirus A71 infection and disease in mice. ZAP sensitivity can thus be readily applied for the rational design of conditionally attenuated viral vaccines.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01223-8"

The options for treatment and prevention of Chagas disease are limited and underutilized. Here we describe the discovery of a series of benzoxaborole compounds with nanomolar activity against extra- and intracellular stages of T. cruzi. Leveraging both ongoing drug discovery efforts in related kinetoplastids, and the exceptional models for rapid drug screening and optimization in T. cruzi, we have identified the prodrug AN15368 that is activated by parasite carboxypeptidases to yield a compound that targets the messenger RNA processing pathway in T. cruzi. AN15368 was found to be active in vitro and in vivo against a range of genetically distinct T. cruzi lineages and was uniformly curative in non-human primates (NHPs) with long-term naturally acquired infections. Treatment in NHPs also revealed no detectable acute toxicity or long-term health or reproductive impact. Thus, AN15368 is an extensively validated and apparently safe, clinically ready candidate with promising potential for prevention and treatment of Chagas disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01211-y"

Antimicrobial stewardship interventions proposed to curb their spread include shorter courses of antimicrobials to reduce selection pressure but individual-level acquisition and selection dynamics are poorly understood. We sampled stool of 425 adults (aged 16-76 years) in Blantyre, Malawi, over 6 months and used multistate modelling and whole-genome sequencing to understand colonization dynamics of ESBL-E. Models suggest a prolonged effect of antimicrobials such that truncating an antimicrobial course at 2 days has a limited effect in reducing colonization. Genomic analysis shows largely indistinguishable diversity of healthcare-associated and community-acquired isolates, hence some apparent acquisition of ESBL-E during hospitalization may instead represent selection from a patient's microbiota by antimicrobial exposure. Our approach could help guide stewardship protocols; interventions that aim to review and truncate courses of unneeded antimicrobials may be of limited use in preventing ESBL-E colonization.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01216-7"

Wildfire season length, and the frequency and size of severe fires have increased owing to climate change. Fires affect ecosystem recovery and modify soil microbiomes and microbially mediated biogeochemical processes. To study wildfire-dependent changes in soil microbiomes, we characterized functional shifts in the soil microbiota (bacteria, fungi and viruses) across burn severity gradients (low, moderate and high severity) 1 yr post fire in coniferous forests in Colorado and Wyoming, USA. We found severity-dependent increases of Actinobacteria encoding genes for heat resistance, fast growth, and pyrogenic carbon utilization that might enhance post-fire survival. We report that increased burn severity led to the loss of ectomycorrhizal fungi and less tolerant microbial taxa. Viruses remained active in post-fire soils and probably influenced carbon cycling and biogeochemistry via turnover of biomass and ecosystem-relevant auxiliary metabolic genes.

Through phenotyping of 331 clinical isolates, we discovered three distinct clusters of isolates, each with different virulence traits and associated with a different clinical outcome. We combined genome-wide association studies with proteome-wide computational structural modelling to define likely causal variants, and employed direct coupling analysis to identify co-evolving, and therefore potentially epistatic, gene networks. We then used in vivo CRISPR-based silencing to validate our findings and discover clinically relevant M. abscessus virulence factors including a secretion system, thus illustrating how phenogenomics can reveal critical pathways within emerging pathogenic bacteria.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01204-x"
"nmicrobiol","Characterization of interactions of dietary cholesterol with the murine and human gut microbiome","Consumption of dietary lipids, such as cholesterol, modulates the gut microbiome with consequences for host health through the production of microbiome-derived metabolites. Despite the implications for host metabolism, a limited number of specific interactions of the gut microbiome with diet-derived lipids have been characterized. This is partially because obtaining species-level resolution of the responsible taxa can be challenging and additional approaches are needed to identify health-relevant metabolites produced from cholesterol-microbiome interactions. Here we performed bio-orthogonal labelling sort sequence spectrometry, a click chemistry based workflow, to profile cholesterol-specific host-microbe interactions. Mice were exposed to an alkyne-functionalized variant of cholesterol and 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing of faecal samples identified diet-derived cholesterol-interacting microbes from the genera Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus and Parabacteroides. Shotgun metagenomic analysis provided species-level resolution of diet-derived cholesterol-interacting microbes with enrichment of bile acid-like and sulfotransferase-like activities. Using untargeted metabolomics, we identify that cholesterol is converted to cholesterol sulfate in a Bacteroides-specific manner via the enzyme BT_0416. Mice monocolonized with Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron lacking Bt_0416 showed altered host cholesterol and cholesterol sulfate compared with wild-type mice, identifying a previously uncharacterized microbiome-transformation of cholesterol and a mechanism for microbiome-dependent contributions to host phenotype. Moreover, identification of a cholesterol-responsive sulfotransferase in Bacteroides suggests diet-dependent mechanisms for altering microbiome-specific cholesterol metabolism. Overall, our work identifies numerous cholesterol-interacting microbes with implications for more precise microbiome-conscious regulation of host cholesterol homeostasis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01195-9"

SARS-CoV-2 established sustained transmission in Brazil early in the pandemic, but important gaps remain in our understanding of virus transmission dynamics at a national scale. We use 17,135 near-complete genomes sampled from 27 Brazilian states and bordering country Paraguay. From March to November 2020, we detected co-circulation of multiple viral lineages that were linked to multiple importations (predominantly from Europe). After November 2020, we detected large, local transmission clusters within the country. In the absence of effective restriction measures, the epidemic progressed, and in January 2021 there was emergence and onward spread, both within and abroad, of variants of concern and variants under monitoring, including Gamma (P.1) and Zeta (P.2). We also characterized a genomic overview of the epidemic in Paraguay and detected evidence of importation of SARS-CoV-2 ancestor lineages and variants of concern from Brazil.

Comchoano encode the necessary apparatus to import energy and other compounds from the host, proteins for host-cell associations and a type IV secretion system closest to Coxiella's that is expressed in Pacific Ocean metatranscriptomes.

The stinkbug Plautia stali is typically associated with its essential gut symbiont, Pantoea sp., which colonizes a specialized symbiotic organ. When sterilized newborn nymphs were infected with E. coli rather than Pantoea sp., only a few insects survived, in which E. coli exhibited specific localization to the symbiotic organ and vertical transmission to the offspring. Through transgenerational maintenance with P. stali, several hypermutating E. coli lines independently evolved to support the host's high adult emergence and improved body colour; these were called 'mutualistic' E. coli. These mutants exhibited slower bacterial growth, smaller size, loss of flagellar motility and lack of an extracellular matrix. Transcriptomic and genomic analyses of 'mutualistic' E. coli lines revealed independent mutations that disrupted the carbon catabolite repression global transcriptional regulator system. Each mutation reproduced the mutualistic phenotypes when introduced into wild-type E. coli, confirming that single carbon catabolite repression mutations can make E. coli an insect mutualist. These findings provide an experimental system for future work on host-microbe symbioses and may explain why microbial mutualisms are omnipresent in nature.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01179-9"

As part of the BARNARDS study, we examined the rectal microbiota of 2,931 neonates (term used up to 60 d) with clinical signs of sepsis and of 15,217 mothers screening for blaCTX-M-15, blaNDM, blaKPC and blaOXA-48-like genes, which were detected in 56.1%, 18.5%, 0% and 4.1% of neonates' rectal swabs and 47.1%, 4.6%, 0% and 1.6% of mothers' rectal swabs, respectively. Carbapenemase-positive bacteria were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and showed a high diversity of bacterial species (57 distinct species/genera) which exhibited resistance to most of the antibiotics tested. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae/E. cloacae complex, the most commonly found isolates, were subjected to whole-genome sequencing analysis and revealed close relationships between isolates from different samples, suggesting transmission of bacteria between neonates, and between neonates and mothers. Associations between the carriage of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and healthcare/environmental factors were identified, and the presence of ARGs was a predictor of neonatal sepsis and adverse birth outcomes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01184-y"

The discovery of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins has piqued interest in the viromes of these wild, scaly-skinned mammals. We sequenced the viromes of 161 pangolins that were smuggled into China and assembled 28 vertebrate-associated viruses, 21 of which have not been previously reported in vertebrates. We named 16 members of Hunnivirus, Pestivirus and Copiparvovirus pangolin-associated viruses. We report that the l-protein has been lost from all hunniviruses identified in pangolins. Sequences of four human-associated viruses were detected in pangolin viromes, including respiratory syncytial virus, Orthopneumovirus, Rotavirus A and Mammalian orthoreovirus. The genomic sequences of five mammal-associated and three tick-associated viruses were also present. Notably, a coronavirus related to HKU4-CoV, which was originally found in bats, was identified. The presence of these viruses in smuggled pangolins identifies these mammals as a potential source of emergent pathogenic viruses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01181-1"
"nmicrobiol","Patient-derived monoclonal antibody neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variants and confers full protection in monkeys","The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant has very high levels of transmission, is resistant to neutralization by authorized therapeutic human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and is less sensitive to vaccine-mediated immunity. To provide additional therapies against Omicron, we isolated a mAb named P2G3 from a previously infected vaccinated donor and showed that it has picomolar-range neutralizing activity against Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2 and all other variants tested. We solved the structure of P2G3 Fab in complex with the Omicron spike using cryo-electron microscopy at 3.04 Å resolution to identify the P2G3 epitope as a Class 3 mAb that is different from mAb-binding spike epitopes reported previously. Using a SARS-CoV-2 Omicron monkey challenge model, we show that P2G3 alone, or in combination with P5C3 (a broadly active Class 1 mAb previously identified), confers complete prophylactic or therapeutic protection. Although we could select for SARS-CoV-2 mutants escaping neutralization by P2G3 or by P5C3 in vitro, they had low infectivity and 'escape' mutations are extremely rare in public sequence databases. We conclude that this combination of mAbs has potential as an anti-Omicron drug.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01198-6"

One of thousands of VSG genes is transcribed by RNA polymerase I in a singular nuclear structure called the expression site body (ESB), but how monoallelic VSG transcription is achieved remains unclear. Using a localization screen of 153 proteins we found one, ESB-specific protein 1 (ESB1), that localized only to the ESB and is expressed only in VSG-expressing life cycle stages. ESB1 associates with DNA near the active VSG promoter and is necessary for VSG expression, with overexpression activating inactive VSG promoters. Mechanistically, ESB1 is necessary for recruitment of a subset of ESB components, including RNA polymerase I, revealing that the ESB has separately assembled subdomains. Because many trypanosomatid parasites have divergent ESB1 orthologues yet do not undergo antigenic variation, ESB1 probably represents an important class of transcription regulators.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01175-z"
"nmicrobiol","Early detection and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genomic variants in wastewater using COJAC","The continuing emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and variants of interest emphasizes the need for early detection and epidemiological surveillance of novel variants. We used genomic sequencing of 122 wastewater samples from three locations in Switzerland to monitor the local spread of B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and P.1 (Gamma) variants of SARS-CoV-2 at a population level. We devised a bioinformatics method named COJAC (Co-Occurrence adJusted Analysis and Calling) that uses read pairs carrying multiple variant-specific signature mutations as a robust indicator of low-frequency variants. Application of COJAC revealed that a local outbreak of the Alpha variant in two Swiss cities was observable in wastewater up to 13 d before being first reported in clinical samples. We further confirmed the ability of COJAC to detect emerging variants early for the Delta variant by analysing an additional 1,339 wastewater samples. While sequencing data of single wastewater samples provide limited precision for the quantification of relative prevalence of a variant, we show that replicate and close-meshed longitudinal sequencing allow for robust estimation not only of the local prevalence but also of the transmission fitness advantage of any variant. We conclude that genomic sequencing and our computational analysis can provide population-level estimates of prevalence and fitness of emerging variants from wastewater samples earlier and on the basis of substantially fewer samples than from clinical samples. Our framework is being routinely used in large national projects in Switzerland and the UK.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01185-x"
"nmicrobiol","Neutralizing antibody activity against 21 SARS-CoV-2 variants in older adults vaccinated with BNT162b2","SARS-CoV-2 variants may threaten the effectiveness of vaccines and antivirals to mitigate serious COVID-19 disease. This is of most concern in clinically vulnerable groups such as older adults. We analysed 72 sera samples from 37 individuals, aged 70-89 years, vaccinated with two doses of BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) 3 weeks apart, for neutralizing antibody responses to wildtype SARS-CoV-2. Between 3 and 20 weeks after the second vaccine dose, neutralizing antibody titres fell 4.9-fold to a median titre of 21.3 (neutralization dose 80%), with 21.6% of individuals having no detectable neutralizing antibodies at the later time point. Next, we examined neutralization of 21 distinct SARS-CoV-2 variant spike proteins with these sera, and confirmed substantial antigenic escape, especially for the Omicron (B.1.1.529, BA.1/BA.2), Beta (B.1.351), Delta (B.1.617.2), Theta (P.3), C.1.2 and B.1.638 spike variants. By combining pseudotype neutralization with specific receptor-binding domain (RBD) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, we showed that changes to position 484 in the spike RBD were mainly responsible for SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody escape. Nineteen sera from the same individuals boosted with a third dose of BNT162b2 contained higher neutralizing antibody titres, providing cross-protection against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2. Despite SARS-CoV-2 immunity waning over time in older adults, booster vaccines can elicit broad neutralizing antibodies against a large number of SARS-CoV-2 variants in this clinically vulnerable cohort.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01163-3"
"nmicrobiol","SARS-CoV-2 Omicron is an immune escape variant with an altered cell entry pathway","Vaccines based on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are a cornerstone of the public health response to COVID-19. The emergence of hypermutated, increasingly transmissible variants of concern (VOCs) threaten this strategy. Omicron (B.1.1.529), the fifth VOC to be described, harbours multiple amino acid mutations in spike, half of which lie within the receptor-binding domain. Here we demonstrate substantial evasion of neutralization by Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants in vitro using sera from individuals vaccinated with ChAdOx1, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. These data were mirrored by a substantial reduction in real-world vaccine effectiveness that was partially restored by booster vaccination. The Omicron variants BA.1 and BA.2 did not induce cell syncytia in vitro and favoured a TMPRSS2-independent endosomal entry pathway, these phenotypes mapping to distinct regions of the spike protein. Impaired cell fusion was determined by the receptor-binding domain, while endosomal entry mapped to the S2 domain. Such marked changes in antigenicity and replicative biology may underlie the rapid global spread and altered pathogenicity of the Omicron variant.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01143-7"
"nmicrobiol","The evolutionary origin of host association in the Rickettsiales","The evolution of obligate host-association of bacterial symbionts and pathogens remains poorly understood. The Rickettsiales are an alphaproteobacterial order of obligate endosymbionts and parasites that infect a wide variety of eukaryotic hosts, including humans, livestock, insects and protists. Induced by their host-associated lifestyle, Rickettsiales genomes have undergone reductive evolution, leading to small, AT-rich genomes with limited metabolic capacities. Here we uncover eleven deep-branching alphaproteobacterial metagenome assembled genomes from aquatic environments, including data from the Tara Oceans initiative and other publicly available datasets, distributed over three previously undescribed Rickettsiales-related clades. Phylogenomic analyses reveal that two of these clades, Mitibacteraceae and Athabascaceae, branch sister to all previously sampled Rickettsiales. The third clade, Gamibacteraceae, branch sister to the recently identified ectosymbiotic 'Candidatus Deianiraea vastatrix'. Comparative analyses indicate that the gene complement of Mitibacteraceae and Athabascaceae is reminiscent of that of free-living and biofilm-associated bacteria. Ancestral genome content reconstruction across the Rickettsiales species tree further suggests that the evolution of host association in Rickettsiales was a gradual process that may have involved the repurposing of a type IV secretion system.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01169-x"

In Bacteria, however, inositol lipid production is relatively rare. Recently, the prominent human gut bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (BT) was reported to produce inositol lipids and sphingolipids, but the pathways remain ambiguous and their prevalence unclear. Here, using genomic and biochemical approaches, we investigated the gene cluster for inositol lipid synthesis in BT using a previously undescribed strain with inducible control of sphingolipid synthesis. We characterized the biosynthetic pathway from myo-inositol-phosphate (MIP) synthesis to phosphoinositol dihydroceramide, determined the crystal structure of the recombinant BT MIP synthase enzyme and identified the phosphatase responsible for the conversion of bacterially-derived phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP-DAG) to phosphatidylinositol (PI-DAG). In vitro, loss of inositol lipid production altered BT capsule expression and antimicrobial peptide resistance. In vivo, loss of inositol lipids decreased bacterial fitness in a gnotobiotic mouse model. We identified a second putative, previously undescribed pathway for bacterial PI-DAG synthesis without a PIP-DAG intermediate, common in Prevotella. Our results indicate that inositol sphingolipid production is widespread in host-associated Bacteroidetes and has implications for symbiosis.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01152-6"
"nmicrobiol","Mating pair stabilization mediates bacterial conjugation species specificity","Bacterial conjugation mediates contact-dependent transfer of DNA from donor to recipient bacteria, thus facilitating the spread of virulence and resistance plasmids. Here we describe how variants of the plasmid-encoded donor outer membrane (OM) protein TraN cooperate with distinct OM receptors in recipients to mediate mating pair stabilization and efficient DNA transfer. We show that TraN from the plasmid pKpQIL (Klebsiella pneumoniae) interacts with OmpK36, plasmids from R100-1 (Shigella flexneri) and pSLT (Salmonella Typhimurium) interact with OmpW, and the prototypical F plasmid (Escherichia coli) interacts with OmpA. Cryo-EM analysis revealed that TraNpKpQIL interacts with OmpK36 through the insertion of a [beta]-hairpin in the tip of TraN into a monomer of the OmpK36 porin trimer. Combining bioinformatic analysis with AlphaFold structural predictions, we identified a fourth TraN structural variant that mediates mating pair stabilization by binding OmpF. Accordingly, we devised a classification scheme for TraN homologues on the basis of structural similarity and their associated receptors: TraN[alpha] (OmpW), TraN[beta] (OmpK36), TraN[gamma] (OmpA), TraN[delta] (OmpF). These TraN-OM receptor pairings have real-world implications as they reflect the distribution of resistance plasmids within clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates, demonstrating the importance of mating pair stabilization in mediating conjugation species specificity. These findings will allow us to predict the distribution of emerging resistance plasmids in high-risk bacterial pathogens.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01146-4"

Bacillus subtilis is commonly found in association with different plant organs, providing protection against pathogens or stimulating plant growth. We report that application of B. subtilis to melon seeds results in genetic and physiological responses in seeds that alter the metabolic and developmental status in 5-d and 1-month-old plants upon germination. We analysed mutants in different components of the extracellular matrix of B. subtilis biofilms in interaction with seeds and found cooperation in bacterial colonization of seed storage tissues and growth promotion. Combining confocal microscopy with fluorogenic probes, we found that two specific components of the extracellular matrix, amyloid protein TasA and fengycin, differentially increased the concentrations of reactive oxygen species inside seeds. Further, using electron and fluorescence microscopy and metabolomics, we showed that both TasA and fengycin targeted the oil bodies in the seed endosperm, resulting in specific changes in lipid metabolism and accumulation of glutathione-related molecules. In turn, this results in two different plant growth developmental programmes: TasA and fengycin stimulate the development of radicles, and fengycin alone stimulate the growth of adult plants and resistance in the phylloplane to the fungus Botrytis cinerea. Understanding mechanisms of bacterial growth promotion will enable the design of bespoke growth promotion strains.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01134-8"

We devised a facile method for mapping DNA-protein interaction sites in vivo using the double-stranded DNA-specific cytosine deaminase toxin DddA. In 3D-seq (DddA-sequencing), strains containing DddA fused to a DNA-binding protein of interest accumulate characteristic mutations in DNA sequence adjacent to sites occupied by the DNA-bound fusion protein. High-depth sequencing enables detection of sites of increased mutation frequency in these strains, yielding genome-wide maps of DNA-protein interaction sites. We validated 3D-seq for four transcription regulators in two bacterial species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. We show that 3D-seq offers ease of implementation, the ability to record binding event signatures over time and the capacity for single-cell resolution.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01133-9"

Treatment efficacy is limited by Mtb's intrinsic drug resistance, as well as its ability to evolve acquired resistance to all antituberculars in clinical use. A deeper understanding of the bacterial pathways that influence drug efficacy could facilitate the development of more effective therapies, identify new mechanisms of acquired resistance, and reveal overlooked therapeutic opportunities. Here we developed a CRISPR interference chemical-genetics platform to titrate the expression of Mtb genes and quantify bacterial fitness in the presence of different drugs. We discovered diverse mechanisms of intrinsic drug resistance, unveiling hundreds of potential targets for synergistic drug combinations. Combining chemical genetics with comparative genomics of Mtb clinical isolates, we further identified several previously unknown mechanisms of acquired drug resistance, one of which is associated with a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis outbreak in South America. Lastly, we found that the intrinsic resistance factor whiB7 was inactivated in an entire Mtb sublineage endemic to Southeast Asia, presenting an opportunity to potentially repurpose the macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin to treat tuberculosis. This chemical-genetic map provides a rich resource to understand drug efficacy in Mtb and guide future tuberculosis drug development and treatment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01130-y"

This, combined with quarantine testing and genomics surveillance, enabled the rapid isolation and characterization of all major SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in Australia in 2021. Our platform facilitated viral variant isolation, rapid resolution of variant fitness using nasopharyngeal swabs and ranking of evasion of neutralizing antibodies. In late 2021, variant of concern Omicron (B1.1.529) emerged. Using our platform, we detected and characterized SARS-CoV-2 VOC Omicron. We show that Omicron effectively evades neutralization antibodies and has a different entry route that is TMPRSS2-independent. Our low-cost platform is available to all and can detect all variants of SARS-CoV-2 studied so far, with the main limitation being that our platform still requires appropriate biocontainment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01135-7"

As is true of most human pathogens, the genetic path to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the role that the immune system plays in modulating AMR during disease are poorly understood. Here we reproduced several routes to fluoroquinolone resistance, performing evolution experiments using sequential lung infections in mice that are replete with or depleted of neutrophils, providing two key insights into the evolution of drug resistance. First, neutropenic hosts acted as reservoirs for the accumulation of drug resistance during drug treatment. Selection for variants with altered drug sensitivity profiles arose readily in the absence of neutrophils, while immunocompetent animals restricted the appearance of these variants. Secondly, antibiotic treatment failure in the immunocompromised host was shown to occur without clinically defined resistance, an unexpected result that provides a model for how antibiotic failure occurs clinically in the absence of AMR. The genetic mechanism underlying both these results is initiated by mutations activating the drug egress pump regulator AdeL, which drives persistence in the presence of antibiotic. Therefore, antibiotic persistence mutations present a two-pronged risk during disease, causing drug treatment failure in the immunocompromised host while simultaneously increasing the emergence of high-level AMR.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01126-8"

We identified associations between gut microbes and host genes that depict shared as well as disease-specific patterns. We found that a common set of host genes and pathways implicated in gastrointestinal inflammation, gut barrier protection and energy metabolism are associated with disease-specific gut microbes. Additionally, we also found that mucosal gut microbes that have been implicated in all three diseases, such as Streptococcus, are associated with different host pathways in each disease, suggesting that similar microbes can affect host pathophysiology in a disease-specific manner through regulation of different host genes. Our framework can be applied to other diseases for the identification of host gene-microbiome associations that may influence disease outcomes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01121-z"

The SARS-CoV-2 Omicron/B.1.1.529 VOC harbours multiple mutations in the spike protein associated with high infectivity and efficient evasion from humoral immunity induced by previous infection or vaccination. By performing in-depth comparisons of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell epitope repertoire after infection and messenger RNA vaccination, we demonstrate that spike-derived epitopes were not dominantly targeted in convalescent individuals compared to non-spike epitopes. In vaccinees, however, we detected a broader spike-specific T-cell response compared to convalescent individuals. Booster vaccination increased the breadth of the spike-specific T-cell response in convalescent individuals but not in vaccinees with complete initial vaccination. In convalescent individuals and vaccinees, the targeted T-cell epitopes were broadly conserved between wild-type SARS-CoV-2 variant B and Omicron/B.1.1.529. Hence, our data emphasize the relevance of vaccine-induced spike-specific CD8+ T-cell responses in combating VOCs including Omicron/B.1.1.529 and support the benefit of boosting convalescent individuals with mRNA vaccines.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01106-y"

However, despite its clinical importance, little is known about how susceptible patients acquire infection from drug-resistant genotypes in the environment. Here, we present a population genomic analysis of 218 A. fumigatus isolates from across the UK and Ireland (comprising 153 clinical isolates from 143 patients and 65 environmental isolates). First, phylogenomic analysis shows strong genetic structuring into two clades (A and B) with little interclade recombination and the majority of environmental azole resistance found within clade A. Second, we show occurrences where azole-resistant isolates of near-identical genotypes were obtained from both environmental and clinical sources, indicating with high confidence the infection of patients with resistant isolates transmitted from the environment. Third, genome-wide scans identified selective sweeps across multiple regions indicating a polygenic basis to the trait in some genetic backgrounds. These signatures of positive selection are seen for loci containing the canonical genes encoding fungicide resistance in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, while other regions under selection have no defined function. Lastly, pan-genome analysis identified genes linked to azole resistance and previously unknown resistance mechanisms. Understanding the environmental drivers and genetic basis of evolving fungal drug resistance needs urgent attention, especially in light of increasing numbers of patients with severe viral respiratory tract infections who are susceptible to opportunistic fungal superinfections.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01091-2"

However, little is known about the development of the gut virome in preterm infants, or its role in NEC. Here, using metagenomic sequencing, we characterized the DNA gut virome of 9 preterm infants who developed NEC and 14 gestational age-matched preterm infants who did not. Infants were sampled longitudinally before NEC onset over the first 11 weeks of life. We observed substantial interindividual variation in the gut virome between unrelated preterm infants, while intraindividual variation over time was significantly less. We identified viral and bacterial signatures in the gut that preceded NEC onset. Specifically, we observed a convergence towards reduced viral beta diversity over the 10 d before NEC onset, which was driven by specific viral signatures and accompanied by specific viral-bacterial interactions. Our results indicate that bacterial and viral perturbations precede the sudden onset of NEC. These findings suggest that early life virome signatures in preterm infants may be implicated in NEC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01096-x"

We performed a large-scale experiment using 579 genetically identical laboratory mice from a single animal facility, designed to identify the causes of disease variability in the widely used dextran sulphate sodium mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Commonly used treatment endpoint measures-weight loss and intestinal pathology-showed limited correlation and varied across mouse lineages. Analysis of the gut microbiome, coupled with machine learning and targeted anaerobic culturing, identified and isolated two previously undescribed species, Duncaniella muricolitica and Alistipes okayasuensis, and demonstrated that they exert dominant effects in the dextran sulphate sodium model leading to variable treatment endpoint measures. We show that the identified gut microbial species are common, but not ubiquitous, in mouse facilities around the world, and suggest that researchers monitor for these species to provide experimental design opportunities for improved mouse models of human intestinal diseases.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01094-z"

We applied single-virus and single-cell infection approaches to quantify cyanophage abundance and infected picocyanobacteria in 87 surface water samples from five transects that traversed approximately 2,200 km in the North Pacific Ocean on three cruises, with a duration of 2-4 weeks, between 2015 and 2017. We detected a 550-km-wide hotspot of cyanophages and virus-infected picocyanobacteria in the transition zone between the North Pacific Subtropical and Subpolar gyres that was present in each transect. Notably, the hotspot occurred at a consistent temperature and displayed distinct cyanophage-lineage composition on all transects. On two of these transects, the levels of infection in the hotspot were estimated to be sufficient to substantially limit the geographical range of Prochlorococcus. Coincident with the detection of high levels of virally infected picocyanobacteria, we measured an increase of 10-100-fold in the Synechococcus populations in samples that are usually dominated by Prochlorococcus. We developed a multiple regression model of cyanophages, temperature and chlorophyll concentrations that inferred that the hotspot extended across the North Pacific Ocean, creating a biological boundary between gyres, with the potential to release organic matter comparable to that of the sevenfold-larger North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.

"nmicrobiol","Microbial communities form rich extracellular metabolomes that foster metabolic interactions and promote drug tolerance","Microbial communities are composed of cells of varying metabolic capacity, and regularly include auxotrophs that lack essential metabolic pathways. Through analysis of auxotrophs for amino acid biosynthesis pathways in microbiome data derived from >12,000 natural microbial communities obtained as part of the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP), and study of auxotrophic-prototrophic interactions in self-establishing metabolically cooperating yeast communities (SeMeCos), we reveal a metabolically imprinted mechanism that links the presence of auxotrophs to an increase in metabolic interactions and gains in antimicrobial drug tolerance. As a consequence of the metabolic adaptations necessary to uptake specific metabolites, auxotrophs obtain altered metabolic flux distributions, export more metabolites and, in this way, enrich community environments in metabolites. Moreover, increased efflux activities reduce intracellular drug concentrations, allowing cells to grow in the presence of drug levels above minimal inhibitory concentrations. For example, we show that the antifungal action of azoles is greatly diminished in yeast cells that uptake metabolites from a metabolically enriched environment. Our results hence provide a mechanism that explains why cells are more robust to drug exposure when they interact metabolically.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01072-5"
"nmicrobiol","Population genomics of Escherichia coli in livestock-keeping households across a rapidly developing urban landscape","Quantitative evidence for the risk of zoonoses and the spread of antimicrobial resistance remains lacking. Here, as part of the UrbanZoo project, we sampled Escherichia coli from humans, livestock and peri-domestic wildlife in 99 households across Nairobi, Kenya, to investigate its distribution among host species in this rapidly developing urban landscape. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 1,338 E. coli isolates and found that the diversity and sharing patterns of E. coli were heavily structured by household and strongly shaped by host type. We also found evidence for inter-household and inter-host sharing and, importantly, between humans and animals, although this occurs much less frequently. Resistome similarity was differently distributed across host and household, consistent with being driven by shared exposure to antimicrobials. Our results indicate that a large, epidemiologically structured sampling framework combined with WGS is needed to uncover strain-sharing events among different host populations in complex environments and the major contributing pathways that could ultimately drive the emergence of zoonoses and the spread of antimicrobial resistance.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01079-y"

"nmicrobiol","Identification and structure of an extracellular contractile injection system from the marine bacterium Algoriphagus machipongonensis","Contractile injection systems (CISs) are phage tail-like nanomachines, mediating bacterial cell-cell interactions as either type VI secretion systems (T6SSs) or extracellular CISs (eCISs). Bioinformatic studies uncovered a phylogenetic group of hundreds of putative CIS gene clusters that are highly diverse and widespread; however, only four systems have been characterized. Here we studied a putative CIS gene cluster in the marine bacterium Algoriphagus machipongonensis. Using an integrative approach, we show that the system is compatible with an eCIS mode of action. Our cryo-electron microscopy structure revealed several features that differ from those seen in other CISs: a 'cap adaptor' located at the distal end, a 'plug' exposed to the tube lumen, and a 'cage' formed by massive extensions of the baseplate. These elements are conserved in other CISs, and our genetic tools identified that they are required for assembly, cargo loading and function. Furthermore, our atomic model highlights specific evolutionary hotspots and will serve as a framework for understanding and re−engineering CISs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-022-01059-2"
"nmicrobiol","Structure of a thylakoid-anchored contractile injection system in multicellular cyanobacteria","Contractile injection systems (CISs) mediate cell-cell interactions by phage tail-like structures, using two distinct modes of action: extracellular CISs are released into the medium, while type 6 secretion systems (T6SSs) are attached to the cytoplasmic membrane and function upon cell-cell contact. Here, we characterized a CIS in the multicellular cyanobacterium Anabaena, with features distinct from extracellular CISs and T6SSs. Cryo-electron tomography of focused ion beam-milled cells revealed that CISs were anchored in thylakoid membrane stacks, facing the cell periphery. Single particle cryo-electron microscopy showed that this unique in situ localization was mediated by extensions of tail fibre and baseplate components. On stress, cyanobacteria induced the formation of ghost cells, presenting thylakoid-anchored CISs to the environment. Functional assays suggest that these CISs may mediate ghost cell formation and/or interactions of ghost cells with other organisms. Collectively, these data provide a framework for understanding the evolutionary re-engineering of CISs and potential roles of these CISs in cyanobacterial programmed cell death.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01055-y"

Here we describe a histone acetylome-wide association study (HAWAS) of an infectious disease, on the basis of genome-wide H3K27 acetylation profiling of peripheral blood granulocytes and monocytes from persons with active Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and healthy controls. We detected >2,000 differentially acetylated loci in either cell type in a Singapore Chinese discovery cohort (n = 46), which were validated in a subsequent multi-ethnic Singapore cohort (n = 29), as well as a longitudinal cohort from South Africa (n = 26), thus demonstrating that HAWAS can be independently corroborated. Acetylation changes were correlated with differential gene expression. Differential acetylation was enriched near potassium channel genes, including KCNJ15, which modulates apoptosis and promotes Mtb clearance in vitro. We performed histone acetylation quantitative trait locus (haQTL) analysis on the dataset and identified 69 candidate causal variants for immune phenotypes among granulocyte haQTLs and 83 among monocyte haQTLs. Our study provides proof-of-principle for HAWAS to infer mechanisms of host response to pathogens.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01049-w"

We performed genomic analyses of 1,246 systematically collected shigellae sampled from seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia as part of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) between 2007 and 2011, to inform control and identify factors that could limit the effectiveness of current approaches. Through contemporaneous comparison among major subgroups, we found that S. sonnei contributes >=6-fold more disease than other Shigella species relative to its genomic diversity, and highlight existing diversity and adaptative capacity among S. flexneri that may generate vaccine escape variants in <6 months. Furthermore, we show convergent evolution of resistance against ciprofloxacin, the current WHO-recommended antimicrobial for the treatment of shigellosis, among Shigella isolates. This demonstrates the urgent need to integrate existing genomic diversity into vaccine and treatment plans for Shigella, providing a framework for the focused application of comparative genomics to guide vaccine development, and the optimization of control and prevention strategies for other pathogens relevant to public health policy considerations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01054-z"

We investigated four-kingdom microbiota alterations using CRC metagenomic datasets of 1,368 samples from 8 distinct geographical cohorts. Integrated analysis identified 20 archaeal, 27 bacterial, 20 fungal and 21 viral species for each single-kingdom diagnostic model. However, our data revealed superior diagnostic accuracy for models constructed with multi-kingdom markers, in particular the addition of fungal species. Specifically, 16 multi-kingdom markers including 11 bacterial, 4 fungal and 1 archaeal feature, achieved good performance in diagnosing patients with CRC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) = 0.83) and maintained accuracy across 3 independent cohorts. Coabundance analysis of the ecological network revealed associations between bacterial and fungal species, such as Talaromyces islandicus and Clostridium saccharobutylicum. Using metagenome shotgun sequencing data, the predictive power of the microbial functional potential was explored and elevated D-amino acid metabolism and butanoate metabolism were observed in CRC. Interestingly, the diagnostic model based on functional EggNOG genes achieved high accuracy (AUROC = 0.86). Collectively, our findings uncovered CRC-associated microbiota common across cohorts and demonstrate the applicability of multi-kingdom and functional markers as CRC diagnostic tools and, potentially, as therapeutic targets for the treatment of CRC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01030-7"
"nmicrobiol","Unique mobile elements and scalable gene flow at the prokaryote-eukaryote boundary revealed by circularized Asgard archaea genomes","Eukaryotic genomes are known to have garnered innovations from both archaeal and bacterial domains but the sequence of events that led to the complex gene repertoire of eukaryotes is largely unresolved. Here, through the enrichment of hydrothermal vent microorganisms, we recovered two circularized genomes of Heimdallarchaeum species that belong to an Asgard archaea clade phylogenetically closest to eukaryotes. These genomes reveal diverse mobile elements, including an integrative viral genome that bidirectionally replicates in a circular form and aloposons, transposons that encode the 5,000 amino acid-sized proteins Otus and Ephialtes. Heimdallaechaeal mobile elements have garnered various genes from bacteria and bacteriophages, likely playing a role in shuffling functions across domains. The number of archaea- and bacteria-related genes follow strikingly different scaling laws in Asgard archaea, exhibiting a genome size-dependent ratio and a functional division resembling the bacteria- and archaea-derived gene repertoire across eukaryotes. Bacterial gene import has thus likely been a continuous process unaltered by eukaryogenesis and scaled up through genome expansion. Our data further highlight the importance of viewing eukaryogenesis in a pan-Asgard context, which led to the proposal of a conceptual framework, that is, the Heimdall nucleation-decentralized innovation-hierarchical import model that accounts for the emergence of eukaryotic complexity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01039-y"

"nmicrobiol","Gut microbiomes from Gambian infants reveal the development of a non-industrialized Prevotella-based trophic network","Distinct bacterial trophic networks exist in the gut microbiota of individuals in industrialized and non-industrialized countries. In particular, non-industrialized gut microbiomes tend to be enriched with Prevotella species. To study the development of these Prevotella-rich compositions, we investigated the gut microbiota of children aged between 7 and 37 months living in rural Gambia (616 children, 1,389 stool samples, stratified by 3-month age groups). These infants, who typically eat a high-fibre, low-protein diet, were part of a double-blind, randomized iron intervention trial (NCT02941081) and here we report the secondary outcome. We found that child age was the largest discriminating factor between samples and that anthropometric indices (collection time points, season, geographic collection site, and iron supplementation) did not significantly influence the gut microbiome. Prevotella copri, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Prevotella stercorea were, on average, the most abundant species in these 1,389 samples (35%, 11% and 7%, respectively). Distinct bacterial trophic network clusters were identified, centred around either P. stercorea or F. prausnitzii and were found to develop steadily with age, whereas P. copri, independently of other species, rapidly became dominant after weaning. This dataset, set within a critical gut microbial developmental time frame, provides insights into the development of Prevotella-rich gut microbiomes, which are typically understudied and are underrepresented in western populations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01023-6"
"nmicrobiol","Improving local prevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections using a causal debiasing framework","Global and national surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is mostly based on targeted schemes focused on testing individuals with symptoms. These tested groups are often unrepresentative of the wider population and exhibit test positivity rates that are biased upwards compared with the true population prevalence. Such data are routinely used to infer infection prevalence and the effective reproduction number, Rt, which affects public health policy. Here, we describe a causal framework that provides debiased fine-scale spatiotemporal estimates by combining targeted test counts with data from a randomized surveillance study in the United Kingdom called REACT. Our probabilistic model includes a bias parameter that captures the increased probability of an infected individual being tested, relative to a non-infected individual, and transforms observed test counts to debiased estimates of the true underlying local prevalence and Rt. We validated our approach on held-out REACT data over a 7-month period. Furthermore, our local estimates of Rt are indicative of 1-week- and 2-week-ahead changes in SARS-CoV-2-positive case numbers. We also observed increases in estimated local prevalence and Rt that reflect the spread of the Alpha and Delta variants. Our results illustrate how randomized surveys can augment targeted testing to improve statistical accuracy in monitoring the spread of emerging and ongoing infectious disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01029-0"

We identified previously undescribed taxa including 3 genera, 15 species and 52 strains. Based on distinct genomic features, we justify the split of the Methanobrevibacter smithii clade into two separate species, with one represented by the previously undescribed 'Candidatus Methanobrevibacter intestini'. Patterns derived from 28,581 protein clusters showed significant associations with sociodemographic characteristics such as age groups and lifestyle. We additionally show that archaea are characterized by specific genomic and functional adaptations to the host and carry a complex virome.

"nmicrobiol","Variation and transmission of the human gut microbiota across multiple familial generations","Although the composition and functional potential of the human gut microbiota evolve over the lifespan, kinship has been identified as a key covariate of microbial community diversification. However, to date, sharing of microbiota features within families has mostly been assessed between parents and their direct offspring. Here we investigate the potential transmission and persistence of familial microbiome patterns and microbial genotypes in a family cohort (n = 102) spanning 3 to 5 generations over the same female bloodline. We observe microbiome community composition associated with kinship, with seven low abundant genera displaying familial distribution patterns. While kinship and current cohabitation emerge as closely entangled variables, our explorative analyses of microbial genotype distribution and transmission estimates point at the latter as a key covariate of strain dissemination. Highest potential transmission rates are estimated between sisters and mother-daughter pairs, decreasing with increasing daughter's age and being higher among cohabiting pairs than those living apart. Although rare, we detect potential transmission events spanning three and four generations, primarily involving species of the genera Alistipes and Bacteroides. Overall, while our analyses confirm the existence of family-bound microbiome community profiles, transmission or co-acquisition of bacterial strains appears to be strongly linked to cohabitation.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01021-8"

"nmicrobiol","Global phylogeny of Treponema pallidum lineages reveals recent expansion and spread of contemporary syphilis","Syphilis, which is caused by the sexually transmitted bacterium Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, has an estimated 6.3 million cases worldwide per annum. In the past ten years, the incidence of syphilis has increased by more than 150% in some high-income countries, but the evolution and epidemiology of the epidemic are poorly understood. To characterize the global population structure of T. pallidum, we assembled a geographically and temporally diverse collection of 726 genomes from 626 clinical and 100 laboratory samples collected in 23 countries. We applied phylogenetic analyses and clustering, and found that the global syphilis population comprises just two deeply branching lineages, Nichols and SS14. Both lineages are currently circulating in 12 of the 23 countries sampled. We subdivided T. p. pallidum into 17 distinct sublineages to provide further phylodynamic resolution. Importantly, two Nichols sublineages have expanded clonally across 9 countries contemporaneously with SS14. Moreover, pairwise genome analyses revealed examples of isolates collected within the last 20 years from 14 different countries that had genetically identical core genomes, which might indicate frequent exchange through international transmission. It is striking that most samples collected before 1983 are phylogenetically distinct from more recently isolated sublineages. Using Bayesian temporal analysis, we detected a population bottleneck occurring during the late 1990s, followed by rapid population expansion in the 2000s that was driven by the dominant T. pallidum sublineages circulating today. This expansion may be linked to changing epidemiology, immune evasion or fitness under antimicrobial selection pressure, since many of the contemporary syphilis lineages we have characterized are resistant to macrolides.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01000-z"
"nmicrobiol","The unusual cell wall of the Lyme disease spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi is shaped by a tick sugar","Peptidoglycan-a mesh sac of glycans that are linked by peptides-is the main component of bacterial cell walls. Peptidoglycan provides structural strength, protects cells from osmotic pressure and contributes to shape. All bacterial glycans are repeating disaccharides of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) [beta]-(1-4)-linked to N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc). Borrelia burgdorferi, the tick-borne Lyme disease pathogen, produces glycan chains in which MurNAc is occasionally replaced with an unknown sugar. Nuclear magnetic resonance, liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy and genetic analyses show that B. burgdorferi produces glycans that contain GlcNAc-GlcNAc. This unusual disaccharide is chitobiose, a component of its chitinous tick vector. Mutant bacteria that are auxotrophic for chitobiose have altered morphology, reduced motility and cell envelope defects that probably result from producing peptidoglycan that is stiffer than that in wild-type bacteria. We propose that the peptidoglycan of B. burgdorferi probably evolved by adaptation to obligate parasitization of a tick vector, resulting in a biophysical cell-wall alteration to withstand the atypical torque associated with twisting motility.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-01003-w"
"nmicrobiol","Wolbachia cifB induces cytoplasmic incompatibility in the malaria mosquito vector","Wolbachia, a maternally inherited intracellular bacterial species, can manipulate host insect reproduction by cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), which results in embryo lethality in crosses between infected males and uninfected females. CI is encoded by two prophage genes, cifA and cifB. Wolbachia, coupled with the sterile insect technique, has been used in field trials to control populations of the dengue vector Aedes albopictus, but CI-inducing strains are not known to infect the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae. Here we show that cifA and cifB can induce conditional sterility in the malaria vector An. gambiae. We used transgenic expression of these Wolbachia-derived genes in the An. gambiae germline to show that cifB is sufficient to cause embryonic lethality and that cifB-induced sterility is rescued by cifA expression in females. When we co-expressed cifA and cifB in male mosquitoes, the CI phenotype was attenuated. In female mosquitoes, cifB impaired fertility, which was overcome by co-expression of cifA. Our findings pave the way towards using CI to control malaria mosquito vectors.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00998-6"
"nmicrobiol","Vertebrate host phylogeny influences gut archaeal diversity","Commonly used 16S rRNA gene primers do not detect the full range of archaeal diversity present in the vertebrate gut. As a result, several questions regarding the archaeal component of the gut microbiota remain, including which Archaea are host-associated, the specificities of such associations and the major factors influencing archaeal diversity. Using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with primers that specifically target Archaea, we obtained sufficient sequence data from 185 gastrointestinal samples collected from 110 vertebrate species that span five taxonomic classes (Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, Amphibia and Actinopterygii), of which the majority were wild. We provide evidence for previously undescribed Archaea-host associations, including Bathyarchaeia and Methanothermobacter, the latter of which was prevalent among Aves and relatively abundant in species with higher body temperatures, although this association could not be decoupled from host phylogeny. Host phylogeny explained archaeal diversity more strongly than diet, while specific taxa were associated with both factors, and cophylogeny was significant and strongest for mammalian herbivores. Methanobacteria was the only class predicted to be present in the last common ancestors of mammals and all host species. Further analysis indicated that Archaea-Bacteria interactions have a limited effect on archaeal diversity. These findings expand our current understanding of Archaea-vertebrate associations.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00980-2"
"nmicrobiol","Bifidobacterium species associated with breastfeeding produce aromatic lactic acids in the infant gut","Breastfeeding profoundly shapes the infant gut microbiota, which is critical for early life immune development, and the gut microbiota can impact host physiology in various ways, such as through the production of metabolites. However, few breastmilk-dependent microbial metabolites mediating host-microbiota interactions are currently known. Here, we demonstrate that breastmilk-promoted Bifidobacterium species convert aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine) into their respective aromatic lactic acids (indolelactic acid, phenyllactic acid and 4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid) via a previously unrecognized aromatic lactate dehydrogenase (ALDH). The ability of Bifidobacterium species to convert aromatic amino acids to their lactic acid derivatives was confirmed using monocolonized mice. Longitudinal profiling of the faecal microbiota composition and metabolome of Danish infants (n = 25), from birth until 6 months of age, showed that faecal concentrations of aromatic lactic acids are correlated positively with the abundance of human milk oligosaccharide-degrading Bifidobacterium species containing the ALDH, including Bifidobacterium longum, B. breve and B. bifidum. We further demonstrate that faecal concentrations of Bifidobacterium-derived indolelactic acid are associated with the capacity of these samples to activate in vitro the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a receptor important for controlling intestinal homoeostasis and immune responses. Finally, we show that indolelactic acid modulates ex vivo immune responses of human CD4+ T cells and monocytes in a dose-dependent manner by acting as an agonist of both the AhR and hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 3 (HCA3). Our findings reveal that breastmilk-promoted Bifidobacterium species produce aromatic lactic acids in the gut of infants and suggest that these microbial metabolites may impact immune function in early life.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00970-4"

Analyses of convalescent sera provide unique insights into antibody longevity and cross-neutralizing activity induced by variant spike proteins, which are putative vaccine candidates. Using sera from 38 individuals infected in wave 1, we show that cross-neutralizing activity can be detected up to 305 days pos onset of symptoms, although sera were less potent against B.1.1.7 (Alpha) and B1.351 (Beta). Over time, despite a reduction in overall neutralization activity, differences in sera neutralization potency against SARS-CoV-2 and the Alpha and Beta variants decreased, which suggests that continued antibody maturation improves tolerance to spike mutations. We also compared the cross-neutralizing activity of wave 1 sera with sera from individuals infected with the Alpha, the Beta or the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants up to 79 days post onset of symptoms. While these sera neutralize the infecting VOC and parental virus to similar levels, cross-neutralization of different SARS-CoV-2 VOC lineages is reduced. These findings will inform the optimization of vaccines to protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00974-0"

We assembled a collection of >1,000 different bacterial strains that were cultured from the fecal samples of 22 FMT donors and recipients. Using our strain collection combined with metagenomic sequencing data from the same samples, we developed a statistical approach named Strainer for the detection and tracking of bacterial strains from metagenomic sequencing data. We applied Strainer to evaluate a cohort of 13 FMT longitudinal clinical interventions and detected stable engraftment of 71% of donor microbiota strains in recipients up to 5 years post-FMT. We found that 80% of recipient gut bacterial strains pre-FMT were eliminated by FMT and that post-FMT the strains present persisted up to 5 years later, together with environmentally acquired strains. Quantification of donor bacterial strain engraftment in recipients independently explained (precision 100%, recall 95%) the clinical outcomes (relapse or success) after initial and repeat FMT. We report a compendium of bacterial species and strains that consistently engraft in recipients over time that could be used in defined live biotherapeutic products as an alternative to FMT.

"nmicrobiol","Plasmodium falciparum is evolving to escape malaria rapid diagnostic tests in Ethiopia","In Africa, most rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for falciparum malaria recognize histidine-rich protein 2 antigen. Plasmodium falciparum parasites lacking histidine-rich protein 2 (pfhrp2) and 3 (pfhrp3) genes escape detection by these RDTs, but it is not known whether these deletions confer sufficient selective advantage to drive rapid population expansion. By studying blood samples from a cohort of 12,572 participants enroled in a prospective, cross-sectional survey along Ethiopia's borders with Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan using RDTs, PCR, an ultrasensitive bead-based immunoassay for antigen detection and next-generation sequencing, we estimate that histidine-rich protein 2-based RDTs would miss 9.7% (95% confidence interval 8.5-11.1) of P. falciparum malaria cases owing to pfhrp2 deletion. We applied a molecular inversion probe-targeted deep sequencing approach to identify distinct subtelomeric deletion patterns and well-established pfhrp3 deletions and to uncover recent expansion of a singular pfhrp2 deletion in all regions sampled. We propose a model in which pfhrp3 deletions have arisen independently multiple times, followed by strong positive selection for pfhrp2 deletion owing to RDT-based test-and-treatment. Existing diagnostic strategies need to be urgently reconsidered in Ethiopia, and improved surveillance for pfhrp2 deletion is needed throughout the Horn of Africa.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00962-4"
"nmicrobiol","Dissemination of Mycobacterium abscessus via global transmission networks","Mycobacterium abscessus, a multidrug-resistant nontuberculous mycobacterium, has emerged as a major pathogen affecting people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although originally thought to be acquired independently from the environment, most individuals are infected with one of several dominant circulating clones (DCCs), indicating the presence of global transmission networks of M. abscessus. How and when these clones emerged and spread globally is unclear. Here, we use evolutionary analyses of isolates from individuals both with and without CF to reconstruct the population history, spatiotemporal spread and recent transmission networks of the DCCs. We demonstrate synchronous expansion of six unrelated DCCs in the 1960s, a period associated with major changes in CF care and survival. Each of these clones has spread globally as a result of rare intercontinental transmission events. We show that the DCCs, but not environmentally acquired isolates, exhibit a specific smoking-associated mutational signature and that current transmission networks include individuals both with and without CF. We therefore propose that the DCCs initially emerged in non-CF populations but were then amplified and spread through the CF community. While individuals with CF are probably the most permissive host, non-CF individuals continue to play a key role in transmission networks and may facilitate long-distance transmission.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00963-3"

Here, to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in Bangladesh at the national level, we analysed outbreak trajectory and variant emergence using genomics, Facebook 'Data for Good' and data from three mobile phone operators. We sequenced the complete genomes of 67 SARS-CoV-2 samples (collected by the IEDCR in Bangladesh between March and July 2020) and combined these data with 324 publicly available Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Bangladesh at that time. We found that most (85%) of the sequenced isolates were Pango lineage B.1.1.25 (58%), B.1.1 (19%) or B.1.36 (8%) in early-mid 2020. Bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis predicted that SARS-CoV-2 first emerged during mid-February in Bangladesh, from abroad, with the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reported on 8 March 2020. At the end of March 2020, three discrete lineages expanded and spread clonally across Bangladesh. The shifting pattern of viral diversity in Bangladesh, combined with the mobility data, revealed that the mass migration of people from cities to rural areas at the end of March, followed by frequent travel between Dhaka (the capital of Bangladesh) and the rest of the country, disseminated three dominant viral lineages. Further analysis of an additional 85 genomes (November 2020 to April 2021) found that importation of variant of concern Beta (B.1.351) had occurred and that Beta had become dominant in Dhaka. Our interpretation that population mobility out of Dhaka, and travel from urban hotspots to rural areas, disseminated lineages in Bangladesh in the first wave continues to inform government policies to control national case numbers by limiting within-country travel.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00955-3"
"nmicrobiol","CcrZ is a pneumococcal spatiotemporal cell cycle regulator that interacts with FtsZ and controls DNA replication by modulating the activity of DnaA","Most bacteria replicate and segregate their DNA concomitantly while growing, before cell division takes place. How bacteria synchronize these different cell cycle events to ensure faithful chromosome inheritance by daughter cells is poorly understood. Here, we identify Cell Cycle Regulator protein interacting with FtsZ (CcrZ) as a conserved and essential protein in pneumococci and related Firmicutes such as Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. CcrZ couples cell division with DNA replication by controlling the activity of the master initiator of DNA replication, DnaA. The absence of CcrZ causes mis-timed and reduced initiation of DNA replication, which subsequently results in aberrant cell division. We show that CcrZ from Streptococcus pneumoniae interacts directly with the cytoskeleton protein FtsZ, which places CcrZ in the middle of the newborn cell where the DnaA-bound origin is positioned. This work uncovers a mechanism for control of the bacterial cell cycle in which CcrZ controls DnaA activity to ensure that the chromosome is replicated at the right time during the cell cycle.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00949-1"

It remains unclear to what extent the host actively selects these communities and whether commensals are adapted to a specific plant species. To address this question, we assembled a sequence-indexed bacterial culture collection from roots and nodules of Lotus japonicus that contains representatives of most species previously identified using metagenomics. We analysed taxonomically paired synthetic communities from L. japonicus and Arabidopsis thaliana in a multi-species gnotobiotic system and detected signatures of host preference among commensal bacteria in a community context, but not in mono-associations. Sequential inoculation experiments revealed priority effects during root microbiota assembly, where established communities are resilient to invasion by latecomers, and that host preference of commensal bacteria confers a competitive advantage in their cognate host. Our findings show that host preference in commensal bacteria from diverse taxonomic groups is associated with their invasiveness into standing root-associated communities.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00941-9"

Two vaccine doses achieved high responses across all ages. Antibody levels increased more slowly and to lower levels with a single dose of ChAdOx1 compared with a single dose of BNT162b2, but waned following a single dose of BNT162b2 in older individuals. In descriptive latent class models, we identified four responder subgroups, including a 'low responder' group that more commonly consisted of people aged >75 years, males and individuals with long-term health conditions. Given our findings, we propose that available vaccines should be prioritized for those not previously infected and that second doses should be prioritized for individuals aged >60 years. Further data are needed to better understand the extent to which quantitative antibody responses are associated with vaccine-mediated protection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00947-3"

"nmicrobiol","Structural and functional characterization of the intracellular filament-forming nitrite oxidoreductase multiprotein complex","Nitrate is an abundant nutrient and electron acceptor throughout Earth's biosphere. Virtually all nitrate in nature is produced by the oxidation of nitrite by the nitrite oxidoreductase (NXR) multiprotein complex. NXR is a crucial enzyme in the global biological nitrogen cycle, and is found in nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (including comammox organisms), which generate the bulk of the nitrate in the environment, and in anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria which produce half of the dinitrogen gas in our atmosphere. However, despite its central role in biology and decades of intense study, no structural information on NXR is available. Here, we present a structural and biochemical analysis of the NXR from the anammox bacterium Kuenenia stuttgartiensis, integrating X-ray crystallography, cryo-electron tomography, helical reconstruction cryo-electron microscopy, interaction and reconstitution studies and enzyme kinetics. We find that NXR catalyses both nitrite oxidation and nitrate reduction, and show that in the cell, NXR is arranged in tubules several hundred nanometres long. We reveal the tubule architecture and show that tubule formation is induced by a previously unidentified, haem-containing subunit, NXR-T. The results also reveal unexpected features in the active site of the enzyme, an unusual cofactor coordination in the protein's electron transport chain, and elucidate the electron transfer pathways within the complex.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00934-8"
"nmicrobiol","Probiotics impact the antibiotic resistance gene reservoir along the human GI tract in a person-specific and antibiotic-dependent manner","Antimicrobial resistance poses a substantial threat to human health. The gut microbiome is considered a reservoir for potential spread of resistance genes from commensals to pathogens, termed the gut resistome. The impact of probiotics, commonly consumed by many in health or in conjunction with the administration of antibiotics, on the gut resistome is elusive. Reanalysis of gut metagenomes from healthy antibiotics-naïve humans supplemented with an 11-probiotic-strain preparation, allowing direct assessment of the gut resistome in situ along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, demonstrated that probiotics reduce the number of antibiotic resistance genes exclusively in the gut of colonization-permissive individuals. In mice and in a separate cohort of humans, a course of antibiotics resulted in expansion of the lower GI tract resistome, which was mitigated by autologous faecal microbiome transplantation or during spontaneous recovery. In contrast, probiotics further exacerbated resistome expansion in the GI mucosa by supporting the bloom of strains carrying vancomycin resistance genes but not resistance genes encoded by the probiotic strains. Importantly, the aforementioned effects were not reflected in stool samples, highlighting the importance of direct sampling to analyse the effect of probiotics and antibiotics on the gut resistome. Analysing antibiotic resistance gene content in additional published clinical trials with probiotics further highlighted the importance of person-specific metagenomics-based profiling of the gut resistome using direct sampling. Collectively, these findings suggest opposing person-specific and antibiotic-dependent effects of probiotics on the resistome, whose contribution to the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes along the human GI tract merit further studies.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00920-0"
"nmicrobiol","Metagenomic compendium of 189,680 DNA viruses from the human gut microbiome","Bacteriophages have important roles in the ecology of the human gut microbiome but are under-represented in reference databases. To address this problem, we assembled the Metagenomic Gut Virus catalogue that comprises 189,680 viral genomes from 11,810 publicly available human stool metagenomes. Over 75% of genomes represent double-stranded DNA phages that infect members of the Bacteroidia and Clostridia classes. Based on sequence clustering we identified 54,118 candidate viral species, 92% of which were not found in existing databases. The Metagenomic Gut Virus catalogue improves detection of viruses in stool metagenomes and accounts for nearly 40% of CRISPR spacers found in human gut Bacteria and Archaea. We also produced a catalogue of 459,375 viral protein clusters to explore the functional potential of the gut virome. This revealed tens of thousands of diversity-generating retroelements, which use error-prone reverse transcription to mutate target genes and may be involved in the molecular arms race between phages and their bacterial hosts.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00928-6"

We report 322 full SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 39,424 reported SARS-CoV-2 infections, thus representing 0.8% of the reported cases. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences revealed the emergence of lineage A.23.1 from lineage A.23. Lineage A.23.1 represented 88% of the genomes observed in December 2020, then 100% of the genomes observed in January 2021. The A.23.1 lineage was also reported in 26 other countries. Although the precise changes in A.23.1 differ from those reported in the first three SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), the A.23.1 spike-protein-coding region has changes similar to VOCs including a change at position 613, a change in the furin cleavage site that extends the basic amino acid motif and multiple changes in the immunogenic N-terminal domain. In addition, the A.23.1 lineage has changes in non-spike proteins including nsp6, ORF8 and ORF9 that are also altered in other VOCs. The clinical impact of the A.23.1 variant is not yet clear and it has not been designated as a VOC. However, our findings of emergence and spread of this variant indicate that careful monitoring of this variant, together with assessment of the consequences of the spike protein changes for COVID-19 vaccine performance, are advisable.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00933-9"
"nmicrobiol","Genomic insights into diverse bacterial taxa that degrade extracellular DNA in marine sediments","Extracellular DNA is a major macromolecule in global element cycles, and is a particularly crucial phosphorus, nitrogen and carbon source for microorganisms in the seafloor. Nevertheless, the identities, ecophysiology and genetic features of DNA-foraging microorganisms in marine sediments are largely unknown. Here, we combined microcosm experiments, DNA stable isotope probing (SIP), single-cell SIP using nano-scale secondary isotope mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) and genome-centric metagenomics to study microbial catabolism of DNA and its subcomponents in marine sediments. 13C-DNA added to sediment microcosms was largely degraded within 10 d and mineralized to 13CO2. SIP probing of DNA revealed diverse 'Candidatus Izemoplasma', Lutibacter, Shewanella and Fusibacteraceae incorporated DNA-derived 13C-carbon. NanoSIMS confirmed incorporation of 13C into individual bacterial cells of Fusibacteraceae sorted from microcosms. Genomes of the 13C-labelled taxa all encoded enzymatic repertoires for catabolism of DNA or subcomponents of DNA. Comparative genomics indicated that diverse 'Candidatus Izemoplasmatales' (former Tenericutes) are exceptional because they encode multiple (up to five) predicted extracellular nucleases and are probably specialized DNA-degraders. Analyses of additional sediment metagenomes revealed extracellular nuclease genes are prevalent among Bacteroidota at diverse sites. Together, our results reveal the identities and functional properties of microorganisms that may contribute to the key ecosystem function of degrading and recycling DNA in the seabed.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00917-9"
"nmicrobiol","A cell surface-exposed protein complex with an essential virulence function in Ustilago maydis","Plant pathogenic fungi colonizing living plant tissue secrete a cocktail of effector proteins to suppress plant immunity and reprogramme host cells. Although many of these effectors function inside host cells, delivery systems used by pathogenic bacteria to translocate effectors into host cells have not been detected in fungi. Here, we show that five unrelated effectors and two membrane proteins from Ustilago maydis, a biotrophic fungus causing smut disease in corn, form a stable protein complex. All seven genes appear co-regulated and are only expressed during colonization. Single mutants arrest in the epidermal layer, fail to suppress host defence responses and fail to induce non-host resistance, two reactions that likely depend on translocated effectors. The complex is anchored in the fungal membrane, protrudes into host cells and likely contacts channel-forming plant plasma membrane proteins. Constitutive expression of all seven complex members resulted in a surface-exposed form in cultured U. maydis cells. As orthologues of the complex-forming proteins are conserved in smut fungi, the complex may become an interesting fungicide target.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00896-x"

The Burden of Antibiotic Resistance in Neonates from Developing Societies (BARNARDS) network was initiated to characterize the cause and burden of antimicrobial resistance in neonatal sepsis for seven LMICs in Africa and South Asia. A total of 36,285 neonates were enrolled in the BARNARDS study between November 2015 and December 2017, of whom 2,483 were diagnosed with culture-confirmed sepsis. Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 258) was the main cause of neonatal sepsis, with Serratia marcescens (n = 151), Klebsiella michiganensis (n = 117), Escherichia coli (n = 75) and Enterobacter cloacae complex (n = 57) also detected. We present whole-genome sequencing, antimicrobial susceptibility and clinical data for 916 out of 1,038 neonatal sepsis isolates (97 isolates were not recovered from initial isolation at local sites). Enterobacterales (K. pneumoniae, E. coli and E. cloacae) harboured multiple cephalosporin and carbapenem resistance genes. All isolated pathogens were resistant to multiple antibiotic classes, including those used to treat neonatal sepsis. Intraspecies diversity of K. pneumoniae and E. coli indicated that multiple antibiotic-resistant lineages cause neonatal sepsis. Our results will underpin research towards better treatments for neonatal sepsis in LMICs.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-021-00870-7"
"nmicrobiol","Adaptation of the small intestine to microbial enteropathogens in Zambian children with stunting","Environmental enteropathy is a major contributor to growth faltering in millions of children in Africa and South Asia. We carried out a longitudinal, observational and interventional study in Lusaka, Zambia, of 297 children with stunting (aged 2-17 months at recruitment) and 46 control children who had good growth (aged 1-5 months at recruitment). Control children contributed data only at baseline. Children were provided with nutritional supplementation of daily cornmeal-soy blend, an egg and a micronutrient sprinkle, and were followed up to 24 months of age. Children whose growth did not improve over 4-6 months of nutritional supplementation were classified as having non-responsive stunting. We monitored microbial translocation from the gut lumen to the bloodstream in the cohort with non-responsive stunting (n = 108) by measuring circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS-binding protein and soluble CD14 at baseline and when non-response was declared. We found that microbial translocation decreased with increasing age, such that LPS declined in 81 (75%) of 108 children with non-responsive stunting, despite sustained pathogen pressure and ongoing intestinal epithelial damage. We used confocal laser endomicroscopy and found that mucosal leakiness also declined with age. However, expression of brush border enzyme, nutrient transporter and mucosal barrier genes in intestinal biopsies did not change with age or correlate with biomarkers of microbial translocation. We propose that environmental enteropathy arises through adaptation to pathogen-mediated epithelial damage. Although environmental enteropathy reduces microbial translocation, it does so at the cost of impaired growth. The reduced epithelial surface area imposed by villus blunting may explain these findings.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00849-w"

These microbiota are an untapped resource of strains, pathways and enzymes that could be applied to convert plant waste into sugar substrates for green biotechnology. We carried out more than 400 parallel enrichment experiments from goat faeces to determine how substrate and antibiotic selection influence membership, activity, stability and chemical productivity of herbivore gut communities. We assembled 719 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that are unique at the species level. More than 90% of these MAGs are from previously unidentified herbivore gut microorganisms. Microbial consortia dominated by anaerobic fungi outperformed bacterially dominated consortia in terms of both methane production and extent of cellulose degradation, which indicates that fungi have an important role in methane release. Metabolic pathway reconstructions from MAGs of 737 bacteria, archaea and fungi suggest that cross-domain partnerships between fungi and methanogens enabled production of acetate, formate and methane, whereas bacterially dominated consortia mainly produced short-chain fatty acids, including propionate and butyrate. Analyses of carbohydrate-active enzyme domains present in each anaerobic consortium suggest that anaerobic bacteria and fungi employ mostly complementary hydrolytic strategies. The division of labour among herbivore anaerobes to degrade plant biomass could be harnessed for industrial bioprocessing.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00861-0"

The effects of groundwater geochemistry on the abundance, distribution, taxonomic diversity and host association of CPR bacteria and DPANN archaea has not been studied. Here, we performed genome-resolved metagenomic analysis of one agricultural and seven pristine groundwater microbial communities and recovered 746 CPR and DPANN genomes in total. The pristine sites, which serve as local sources of drinking water, contained up to 31% CPR bacteria and 4% DPANN archaea. We observed little species-level overlap of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across the groundwater sites, indicating that CPR and DPANN communities may be differentiated according to physicochemical conditions and host populations. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy imaging and genomic analyses enabled us to identify CPR and DPANN lineages that reproducibly attach to host cells and showed that the growth of CPR bacteria seems to be stimulated by attachment to host-cell surfaces. Our analysis reveals site-specific diversity of CPR bacteria and DPANN archaea that coexist with diverse hosts in groundwater aquifers. Given that CPR and DPANN organisms have been identified in human microbiomes and their presence is correlated with diseases such as periodontitis, our findings are relevant to considerations of drinking water quality and human health.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00840-5"

The most common Salmonella enterica pathovariant associated with invasive nontyphoidal Salmonella disease is Salmonella Typhimurium sequence type (ST)313. It has been proposed that antimicrobial resistance and genome degradation has contributed to the success of ST313 lineages in Africa, but the evolutionary trajectory of such changes was unclear. Here, to define the evolutionary dynamics of ST313, we sub-sampled from two comprehensive collections of Salmonella isolates from African patients with bloodstream infections, spanning 1966 to 2018. The resulting 680 genome sequences led to the discovery of a pan-susceptible ST313 lineage (ST313 L3), which emerged in Malawi in 2016 and is closely related to ST313 variants that cause gastrointestinal disease in the United Kingdom and Brazil. Genomic analysis revealed degradation events in important virulence genes in ST313 L3, which had not occurred in other ST313 lineages. Despite arising only recently in the clinic, ST313 L3 is a phylogenetic intermediate between ST313 L1 and L2, with a characteristic accessory genome. Our in-depth genotypic and phenotypic characterization identifies the crucial loss-of-function genetic events that occurred during the stepwise evolution of invasive S.

Using RNA antisense purification and mass spectrometry, we identified up to 104 human proteins that directly and specifically bind to SARS-CoV-2 RNAs in infected human cells. We integrated the SARS-CoV-2 RNA interactome with changes in proteome abundance induced by viral infection and linked interactome proteins to cellular pathways relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infections. We demonstrated by genetic perturbation that cellular nucleic acid-binding protein (CNBP) and La-related protein 1 (LARP1), two of the most strongly enriched viral RNA binders, restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected cells and provide a global map of their direct RNA contact sites. Pharmacological inhibition of three other RNA interactome members, PPIA, ATP1A1, and the ARP2/3 complex, reduced viral replication in two human cell lines. The identification of host dependency factors and defence strategies as presented in this work will improve the design of targeted therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-00846-z"

We analysed generation-resolved iMGE-host dynamics spanning one and a half years in a microbial consortium from a biological wastewater treatment plant using integrated meta-omics. We identified 31 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes encoding complete CRISPR-Cas systems and their corresponding iMGEs. CRISPR-targeted plasmids outnumbered their bacteriophage counterparts by at least fivefold, highlighting the importance of CRISPR-mediated defence against plasmids. Linear modelling of our time-series data revealed that the variation in plasmid abundance over time explained more of the observed community dynamics than phages. Community-scale CRISPR-based plasmid-host and phage-host interaction networks revealed an increase in CRISPR-mediated interactions coinciding with a decrease in the dominant 'Candidatus Microthrix parvicella' population. Protospacers were enriched in sequences targeting genes involved in the transmission of iMGEs.

"nmicrobiol","Large freshwater phages with the potential to augment aerobic methane oxidation","There is growing evidence that phages with unusually large genomes are common across various microbiomes, but little is known about their genetic inventories or potential ecosystem impacts. In the present study, we reconstructed large phage genomes from freshwater lakes known to contain bacteria that oxidize methane. Of manually curated genomes, 22 (18 are complete), ranging from 159 kilobase (kb) to 527 kb in length, were found to encode the pmoC gene, an enzymatically critical subunit of the particulate methane monooxygenase, the predominant methane oxidation catalyst in nature. The phage-associated PmoC sequences show high similarity to (>90%), and affiliate phylogenetically with, those of coexisting bacterial methanotrophs, including members of Methyloparacoccus, Methylocystis and Methylobacter spp. In addition, pmoC-phage abundance patterns correlate with those of the coexisting bacterial methanotrophs, supporting host-phage relationships. Future work is needed to determine whether phage-associated PmoC has similar functions to additional copies of PmoC encoded in bacterial genomes, thus contributing to growth on methane. Transcriptomics data from Lake Rotsee (Switzerland) showed that some phage-associated pmoC genes were highly expressed in situ and, of interest, that the most rapidly growing methanotroph was infected by three pmoC-phages. Thus, augmentation of bacterial methane oxidation by pmoC-phages during infection could modulate the efflux of this potent greenhouse gas into the environment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0779-9"

Here, we analysed the RNA virome from approximately 10 l water from Yangshan Deep-Water Harbour near the Yangtze River estuary in China and identified more than 4,500 distinct RNA viruses, doubling the previously known set of viruses. Phylogenomic analysis identified several major lineages, roughly, at the taxonomic ranks of class, order and family. The 719-member-strong Yangshan virus assemblage is the sister clade to the expansive class Alsuviricetes and consists of viruses with simple genomes that typically encode only RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), capping enzyme and capsid protein. Several clades within the Yangshan assemblage independently evolved domain permutation in the RdRP. Another previously unknown clade shares ancestry with Potyviridae, the largest known plant virus family. The 'Aquatic picorna-like viruses/Marnaviridae' clade was greatly expanded, with more than 800 added viruses. Several RdRP-linked protein domains not previously detected in any RNA viruses were identified, such as the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) domain, phospholipase A2 and PrsW-family protease domain. Multiple viruses utilize alternative genetic codes implying protist (especially ciliate) hosts. The results reveal a vast RNA virome that includes many previously unknown groups.

The International Code of Nomenclature of Prokaryotes (ICNP) only recognizes cultures as 'type material', thereby preventing the naming of uncultivated organisms. In this Consensus Statement, we propose two potential paths to solve this nomenclatural conundrum. One option is the adoption of previously proposed modifications to the ICNP to recognize DNA sequences as acceptable type material; the other option creates a nomenclatural code for uncultivated Archaea and Bacteria that could eventually be merged with the ICNP in the future. Regardless of the path taken, we believe that action is needed now within the scientific community to develop consistent rules for nomenclature of uncultivated taxa in order to provide clarity and stability, and to effectively communicate microbial diversity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0733-x"
"nmicrobiol","The new scope of virus taxonomy: partitioning the virosphere into 15 hierarchical ranks","Virus taxonomy emerged as a discipline in the middle of the twentieth century. Traditionally, classification by virus taxonomists has been focussed on the grouping of relatively closely related viruses. However, during the past few years, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has recognized that the taxonomy it develops can be usefully extended to include the basal evolutionary relationships among distantly related viruses. Consequently, the ICTV has changed its Code to allow a 15-rank classification hierarchy that closely aligns with the Linnaean taxonomic system and may accommodate the entire spectrum of genetic divergence in the virosphere. The current taxonomies of three human pathogens, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and herpes simplex virus 1 are used to illustrate the impact of the expanded rank structure. This new rank hierarchy of virus taxonomy will stimulate further research on virus origins and evolution, and vice versa, and could promote crosstalk with the taxonomies of cellular organisms.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0709-x"

The Coronaviridae Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae, has assessed the placement of the human pathogen, tentatively named 2019-nCoV, within the Coronaviridae. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, and designates it as SARS-CoV-2. In order to facilitate communication, the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/host/location/isolate/date. While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined, the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance.

However, traditional molecular epidemiology does not typically occur on a timescale that could affect patient treatment and outcomes. Here, we present a method called 'genomic neighbour typing' for inferring the phenotype of a bacterial sample by identifying its closest relatives in a database of genomes with metadata. We show that this technique can infer antibiotic susceptibility and resistance for both Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. We implemented this with rapid k-mer matching, which, when used on Oxford Nanopore MinION data, can run in real time. This resulted in the determination of resistance within 10 min (91% sensitivity and 100% specificity for S. pneumoniae and 81% sensitivity and 100% specificity for N. gonorrhoeae from isolates with a representative database) of starting sequencing, and within 4 h of sample collection (75% sensitivity and 100% specificity for S. pneumoniae) for clinical metagenomic sputum samples.

Using Nanopore data, we reliably classified a 20-species mock community and captured the diversity of the immature gut microbiota over time and in response to interventions such as probiotic supplementation, antibiotic treatment or episodes of suspected sepsis. We also performed rapid real-time runs to assess gut-associated microbial communities in critically ill and healthy infants, facilitated by NanoOK RT software package, which analysed sequences as they were generated. Our pipeline reliably identified pathogenic bacteria (that is, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae) and their corresponding antimicrobial resistance gene profiles within as little as 1 h of sequencing. Results were confirmed using pathogen isolation, whole-genome sequencing and antibiotic susceptibility testing, as well as mock communities and clinical samples with known antimicrobial resistance genes. Our results demonstrate that MinION (including cost-effective Flongle flow cells) with NanoOK RT can process metagenomic samples to a rich dataset in < 5 h, which creates a platform for future studies aimed at developing these tools and approaches in clinical settings with a focus on providing tailored patient antimicrobial treatment options.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0626-z"

We used Bayesian geostatistical modelling to estimate LRI incidence, prevalence and mortality in children under 5 subnationally in Africa for 2000-2017, using surveys covering 1.46 million children and 9,215,000 cases of LRI. Our model reveals large within-country variation in both health burden and its change over time. While reductions in childhood morbidity and mortality due to LRI were estimated for almost every country, we expose a cluster of residual high risk across seven countries, which averages 5.5 LRI deaths per 1,000 children per year. The preventable nature of the vast majority of LRI deaths mandates focused health system efforts in specific locations with the highest burden.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0562-y"
"nmicrobiol","Life cycle progression and sexual development of the apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum","The apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium is a leading global cause of severe diarrhoeal disease and an important contributor to early childhood mortality. Currently, there are no fully effective treatments or vaccines available. Parasite transmission occurs through ingestion of oocysts, through either direct contact or consumption of contaminated water or food. Oocysts are meiotic spores and the product of parasite sex. Cryptosporidium has a single-host life cycle in which both asexual and sexual processes occur in the intestine of infected hosts. Here, we genetically engineered strains of Cryptosporidium to make life cycle progression and parasite sex tractable. We derive reporter strains to follow parasite development in culture and in infected mice and define the genes that orchestrate sex and oocyst formation through mRNA sequencing of sorted cells. After 2 d, parasites in cell culture show pronounced sexualization, but productive fertilization does not occur and infection falters. By contrast, in infected mice, male gametes successfully fertilize female parasites, which leads to meiotic division and sporulation. To rigorously test for fertilization, we devised a two-component genetic-crossing assay using a reporter that is activated by Cre recombinase. Our findings suggest obligate developmental progression towards sex in Cryptosporidium, which has important implications for the treatment and prevention of the infection.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0539-x"
"nmicrobiol","Cryptic inoviruses revealed as pervasive in bacteria and archaea across Earth's biomes","Bacteriophages from the Inoviridae family (inoviruses) are characterized by their unique morphology, genome content and infection cycle. One of the most striking features of inoviruses is their ability to establish a chronic infection whereby the viral genome resides within the cell in either an exclusively episomal state or integrated into the host chromosome and virions are continuously released without killing the host. To date, a relatively small number of inovirus isolates have been extensively studied, either for biotechnological applications, such as phage display, or because of their effect on the toxicity of known bacterial pathogens including Vibrio cholerae and Neisseria meningitidis. Here, we show that the current 56 members of the Inoviridae family represent a minute fraction of a highly diverse group of inoviruses. Using a machine learning approach leveraging a combination of marker gene and genome features, we identified 10,295 inovirus-like sequences from microbial genomes and metagenomes. Collectively, our results call for reclassification of the current Inoviridae family into a viral order including six distinct proposed families associated with nearly all bacterial phyla across virtually every ecosystem. Putative inoviruses were also detected in several archaeal genomes, suggesting that, collectively, members of this supergroup infect hosts across the domains Bacteria and Archaea. Finally, we identified an expansive diversity of inovirus-encoded toxin-antitoxin and gene expression modulation systems, alongside evidence of both synergistic (CRISPR evasion) and antagonistic (superinfection exclusion) interactions with co-infecting viruses, which we experimentally validated in a Pseudomonas model. Capturing this previously obscured component of the global virosphere may spark new avenues for microbial manipulation approaches and innovative biotechnological applications.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0510-x"

The geographical range of dengue is expected to further expand due to ongoing global phenomena including climate change and urbanization. We applied statistical mapping techniques to the most extensive database of case locations to date to predict global environmental suitability for the virus as of 2015. We then made use of climate, population and socioeconomic projections for the years 2020, 2050 and 2080 to project future changes in virus suitability and human population at risk. This study is the first to consider the spread of Aedes mosquito vectors to project dengue suitability. Our projections provide a key missing piece of evidence for the changing global threat of vector-borne disease and will help decision-makers worldwide to better prepare for and respond to future changes in dengue risk.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0476-8"
"nmicrobiol","Two intracellular and cell type-specific bacterial symbionts in the placozoan Trichoplax H2","Placozoa is an enigmatic phylum of simple, microscopic, marine metazoans1,2. Although intracellular bacteria have been found in all members of this phylum, almost nothing is known about their identity, location and interactions with their host3,4,5,6. We used metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing of single host individuals, plus metaproteomic and imaging analyses, to show that the placozoan Trichoplax sp. H2 lives in symbiosis with two intracellular bacteria. One symbiont forms an undescribed genus in the Midichloriaceae (Rickettsiales)7,8 and has a genomic repertoire similar to that of rickettsial parasites9,10, but does not seem to express key genes for energy parasitism. Correlative image analyses and three-dimensional electron tomography revealed that this symbiont resides in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of its host's internal fibre cells. The second symbiont belongs to the Margulisbacteria, a phylum without cultured representatives and not known to form intracellular associations11,12,13. This symbiont lives in the ventral epithelial cells of Trichoplax, probably metabolizes algal lipids digested by its host and has the capacity to supplement the placozoan's nutrition. Our study shows that one of the simplest animals has evolved highly specific and intimate associations with symbiotic, intracellular bacteria and highlights that symbioses can provide access to otherwise elusive microbial dark matter.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0475-9"
"nmicrobiol","Mediterranean grassland soil C-N compound turnover is dependent on rainfall and depth, and is mediated by genomically divergent microorganisms","Soil microbial activity drives the carbon and nitrogen cycles and is an important determinant of atmospheric trace gas turnover, yet most soils are dominated by microorganisms with unknown metabolic capacities. Even Acidobacteria, among the most abundant bacteria in soil, remain poorly characterized, and functions across groups such as Verrucomicrobia, Gemmatimonadetes, Chloroflexi and Rokubacteria are understudied. Here, we have resolved 60 metagenomic and 20 proteomic data sets from a Mediterranean grassland soil ecosystem and recovered 793 near-complete microbial genomes from 18 phyla, representing around one-third of all microorganisms detected. Importantly, this enabled extensive genomics-based metabolic predictions for these communities. Acidobacteria from multiple previously unstudied classes have genomes that encode large enzyme complements for complex carbohydrate degradation. Alternatively, most microorganisms encode carbohydrate esterases that strip readily accessible methyl and acetyl groups from polymers like pectin and xylan, forming methanol and acetate, the availability of which could explain the high prevalence of C1 metabolism and acetate utilization in genomes. Microorganism abundances among samples collected at three soil depths and under natural and amended rainfall regimes indicate statistically higher associations of inorganic nitrogen metabolism and carbon degradation in deep and shallow soils, respectively. This partitioning decreased in samples under extended spring rainfall, indicating that long-term climate alteration can affect both carbon and nitrogen cycling. Overall, by leveraging natural and experimental gradients with genome-resolved metabolic profiles, we link microorganisms lacking prior genomic characterization to specific roles in complex carbon, C1, nitrate and ammonia transformations, and constrain factors that impact their distributions in soil.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0449-y"

"nmicrobiol","Past and future spread of the arbovirus vectors Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus","The global population at risk from mosquito-borne diseases-including dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika-is expanding in concert with changes in the distribution of two key vectors: Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. The distribution of these species is largely driven by both human movement and the presence of suitable climate. Using statistical mapping techniques, we show that human movement patterns explain the spread of both species in Europe and the United States following their introduction. We find that the spread of Ae. aegypti is characterized by long distance importations, while Ae. albopictus has expanded more along the fringes of its distribution. We describe these processes and predict the future distributions of both species in response to accelerating urbanization, connectivity and climate change. Global surveillance and control efforts that aim to mitigate the spread of chikungunya, dengue, yellow fever and Zika viruses must consider the so far unabated spread of these mosquitos. Our maps and predictions offer an opportunity to strategically target surveillance and control programmes and thereby augment efforts to reduce arbovirus burden in human populations globally.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-019-0376-y"
"nmicrobiol","Megaphages infect Prevotella and variants are widespread in gut microbiomes","Bacteriophages (phages) dramatically shape microbial community composition, redistribute nutrients via host lysis and drive evolution through horizontal gene transfer. Despite their importance, much remains to be learned about phages in the human microbiome. We investigated the gut microbiomes of humans from Bangladesh and Tanzania, two African baboon social groups and Danish pigs; many of these microbiomes contain phages belonging to a clade with genomes >540 kilobases in length, the largest yet reported in the human microbiome and close to the maximum size ever reported for phages. We refer to these as Lak phages. CRISPR spacer targeting indicates that Lak phages infect bacteria of the genus Prevotella. We manually curated to completion 15 distinct Lak phage genomes recovered from metagenomes. The genomes display several interesting features, including use of an alternative genetic code, large intergenic regions that are highly expressed and up to 35 putative transfer RNAs, some of which contain enigmatic introns. Different individuals have distinct phage genotypes, and shifts in variant frequencies over consecutive sampling days reflect changes in the relative abundance of phage subpopulations. Recent homologous recombination has resulted in extensive genome admixture of nine baboon Lak phage populations. We infer that Lak phages are widespread in gut communities that contain the Prevotella species, and conclude that megaphages, with fascinating and underexplored biology, may be common but largely overlooked components of human and animal gut microbiomes.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0338-9"
"nmicrobiol","Interspecies cross-feeding orchestrates carbon degradation in the rumen ecosystem","Because of their agricultural value, there is a great body of research dedicated to understanding the microorganisms responsible for rumen carbon degradation. However, we lack a holistic view of the microbial food web responsible for carbon processing in this ecosystem. Here, we sampled rumen-fistulated moose, allowing access to rumen microbial communities actively degrading woody plant biomass in real time. We resolved 1,193 viral contigs and 77 unique, near-complete microbial metagenome-assembled genomes, many of which lacked previous metabolic insights. Plant-derived metabolites were measured with NMR and carbohydrate microarrays to quantify the carbon nutrient landscape. Network analyses directly linked measured metabolites to expressed proteins from these unique metagenome-assembled genomes, revealing a genome-resolved three-tiered carbohydrate-fuelled trophic system. This provided a glimpse into microbial specialization into functional guilds defined by specific metabolites. To validate our proteomic inferences, the catalytic activity of a polysaccharide utilization locus from a highly connected metabolic hub genome was confirmed using heterologous gene expression. Viral detected proteins and linkages to microbial hosts demonstrated that phage are active controllers of rumen ecosystem function. Our findings elucidate the microbial and viral members, as well as their metabolic interdependencies, that support in situ carbon degradation in the rumen ecosystem.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0225-4"

SAGs provide robust placement for early-diverging lineages and infer a diploid ancestor of fungi. Early-diverging fungi share metabolic deficiencies and show unique gene expansions correlated with parasitism and unculturability.

"nmicrobiol","Dynamics of antimicrobial resistance in intestinal Escherichia coli from children in community settings in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa","The dynamics of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in developing countries are poorly understood, especially in community settings, due to a sparsity of data on AMR prevalence and genetics. We used a combination of phenotyping, genomics and antimicrobial usage data to investigate patterns of AMR amongst atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (aEPEC) strains isolated from children younger than five years old in seven developing countries (four in sub-Saharan Africa and three in South Asia) over a three-year period. We detected high rates of AMR, with 65% of isolates displaying resistance to three or more drug classes. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a diversity of known genetic mechanisms for AMR that accounted for >95% of phenotypic resistance, with comparable rates amongst aEPEC strains associated with diarrhoea or asymptomatic carriage. Genetic determinants of AMR were associated with the geographic location of isolates, not E. coli lineage, and AMR genes were frequently co-located, potentially enabling the acquisition of multi-drug resistance in a single step. Comparison of AMR with antimicrobial usage data showed that the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins was correlated with usage, which was higher in South Asia than in Africa. This study provides much-needed insights into the frequency and mechanisms of AMR in intestinal E. coli in children living in community settings in developing countries.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0217-4"

The role of viruses, which are known to affect microbial dynamics, metabolism and biogeochemistry in the oceans8,9,10, remains largely unexplored in soil. Here, we aimed to investigate how viruses influence microbial ecology and carbon metabolism in peatland soils along a permafrost thaw gradient in Sweden. We recovered 1,907 viral populations (genomes and large genome fragments) from 197 bulk soil and size-fractionated metagenomes, 58% of which were detected in metatranscriptomes and presumed to be active. In silico predictions linked 35% of the viruses to microbial host populations, highlighting likely viral predators of key carbon-cycling microorganisms, including methanogens and methanotrophs. Lineage-specific virus/host ratios varied, suggesting that viral infection dynamics may differentially impact microbial responses to a changing climate. Virus-encoded glycoside hydrolases, including an endomannanase with confirmed functional activity, indicated that viruses influence complex carbon degradation and that viral abundances were significant predictors of methane dynamics. These findings suggest that viruses may impact ecosystem function in climate-critical, terrestrial habitats and identify multiple potential viral contributions to soil carbon cycling.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0190-y"
"nmicrobiol","Nitrogen-fixing populations of Planctomycetes and Proteobacteria are abundant in surface ocean metagenomes","Nitrogen fixation in the surface ocean impacts global marine nitrogen bioavailability and thus microbial primary productivity. Until now, cyanobacterial populations have been viewed as the main suppliers of bioavailable nitrogen in this habitat. Although PCR amplicon surveys targeting the nitrogenase reductase gene have revealed the existence of diverse non-cyanobacterial diazotrophic populations, subsequent quantitative PCR surveys suggest that they generally occur in low abundance. Here, we use state-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies to recover nearly one thousand non-redundant microbial population genomes from the TARA Oceans metagenomes. Among these, we provide the first genomic evidence for non-cyanobacterial diazotrophs inhabiting surface waters of the open ocean, which correspond to lineages within the Proteobacteria and, most strikingly, the Planctomycetes. Members of the latter phylum are prevalent in aquatic systems, but have never been linked to nitrogen fixation previously. Moreover, using genome-wide quantitative read recruitment, we demonstrate that the discovered diazotrophs were not only widespread but also remarkably abundant (up to 0.3% of metagenomic reads for a single population) in both the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean northwest. Our results extend decades of PCR-based gene surveys, and substantiate the importance of heterotrophic bacteria in the fixation of nitrogen in the surface ocean.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0176-9"

A key objective of metagenomic studies is to analyse organism-specific metabolic pathways and reconstruct community interaction networks. This requires accurate assignment of assembled genome fragments to genomes. Existing binning methods often fail to reconstruct a reasonable number of genomes and report many bins of low quality and completeness. Furthermore, the performance of existing algorithms varies between samples and biotopes. Here, we present a dereplication, aggregation and scoring strategy, DAS Tool, that combines the strengths of a flexible set of established binning algorithms. DAS Tool applied to a constructed community generated more accurate bins than any automated method. Indeed, when applied to environmental and host-associated samples of different complexity, DAS Tool recovered substantially more near-complete genomes, including previously unreported lineages, than any single binning method alone. The ability to reconstruct many near-complete genomes from metagenomics data will greatly advance genome-centric analyses of ecosystems.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0171-1"

In the absence of new therapies, mortality rates due to untreatable infections are predicted to rise more than tenfold by 2050. Natural products (NPs) made by cultured bacteria have been a major source of clinically useful antibiotics. In spite of decades of productivity, the use of bacteria in the search for new antibiotics was largely abandoned due to high rediscovery rates2,3. As only a fraction of bacterial diversity is regularly cultivated in the laboratory and just a fraction of the chemistries encoded by cultured bacteria are detected in fermentation experiments, most bacterial NPs remain hidden in the global microbiome. In an effort to access these hidden NPs, we have developed a culture-independent NP discovery platform that involves sequencing, bioinformatic analysis and heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters captured on DNA extracted from environmental samples. Here, we describe the application of this platform to the discovery of the malacidins, a distinctive class of antibiotics that are commonly encoded in soil microbiomes but have never been reported in culture-based NP discovery efforts. The malacidins are active against multidrug-resistant pathogens, sterilize methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin infections in an animal wound model and did not select for resistance under our laboratory conditions.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-018-0110-1"

Here, we continually sampled a CO2-driven geyser (Colorado Plateau, Utah, USA) over its 5-day eruption cycle to test the hypothesis that stratified, sandstone-hosted aquifers sampled over three phases of the eruption cycle have microbial communities that differ both in membership and function. Genome-resolved metagenomics, single-cell genomics and geochemical analyses confirmed this hypothesis and linked microorganisms to groundwater compositions from different depths. Autotrophic Candidatus “Altiarchaeum sp.” and phylogenetically deep-branching nanoarchaea dominate the deepest groundwater. A nanoarchaeon with limited metabolic capacity is inferred to be a potential symbiont of the Ca. “Altiarchaeum”. Candidate Phyla Radiation bacteria are also present in the deepest groundwater and they are relatively abundant in water from intermediate depths. During the recovery phase of the geyser, microaerophilic Fe- and S-oxidizers have high in situ genome replication rates. Autotrophic Sulfurimonas sustained by aerobic sulfide oxidation and with the capacity for N2 fixation dominate the shallow aquifer. Overall, 104 different phylum-level lineages are present in water from these subsurface environments, with uncultivated archaea and bacteria partitioned to the deeper subsurface.","https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-017-0098-y"

Time-resolved metagenomics demonstrated that an aerobic cellulolytic consortium cultivated from compost exhibited community dynamics consistent with the definition of an endogenous heterotrophic succession. The genome of the proposed pioneer population, 'Candidatus Reconcilibacillus cellulovorans', possessed a gene cluster containing multidomain glycoside hydrolases (GHs). Purification of the soluble cellulase activity from a 300litre cultivation of this consortium revealed that ~70% of the activity arose from the 'Ca. Reconcilibacillus cellulovorans' multidomain GHs assembled into cellulase complexes through glycosylation. These remarkably stable complexes have supramolecular structures for enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis that are distinct from cellulosomes. The persistence of these complexes during cultivation indicates that they may be active through multiple cultivations of this consortium and act as public goods that sustain the community.

These genomes increase the phylogenetic diversity of bacterial and archaeal genome trees by >30% and provide the first representatives of 17 bacterial and three archaeal candidate phyla. We also recovered 245 genomes from the Patescibacteria superphylum (also known as the Candidate Phyla Radiation) and find that the relative diversity of this group varies substantially with different protein marker sets.

The pure culture of prokaryotes, neglected in recent decades, remains essential to elucidating the role of these organisms2. We recently introduced microbial culturomics, a culturing approach that uses multiple culture conditions and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight and 16S rRNA for identification2. Here, we have selected the best culture conditions to increase the number of studied samples and have applied new protocols (fresh-sample inoculation; detection of microcolonies and specific cultures of Proteobacteria and microaerophilic and halophilic prokaryotes) to address the weaknesses of the previous studies3-5. We identified 1,057 prokaryotic species, thereby adding 531 species to the human gut repertoire: 146 bacteria known in humans but not in the gut, 187 bacteria and 1 archaea not previously isolated in humans, and 197 potentially new species. Genome sequencing was performed on the new species. By comparing the results of the metagenomic and culturomic analyses, we show that the use of culturomics allows the culture of organisms corresponding to sequences previously not assigned.

We examined more than 1,000 soils and found this spartobacterial phylotype to be ubiquitous and consistently one of the most abundant soil bacterial phylotypes, particularly in grasslands, where it was typically the most abundant. We reconstructed a nearly complete genome of this phylotype from a soil metagenome for which we propose the provisional name 'Candidatus Udaeobacter copiosus'. The Ca. U. copiosus genome is unusually small for a cosmopolitan soil bacterium, estimated by one measure to be only 2.81 Mbp, compared to the predicted effective mean genome size of 4.74 Mbp for soil bacteria. Metabolic reconstruction suggests that Ca. U. copiosus is an aerobic heterotroph with numerous putative amino acid and vitamin auxotrophies. The large population size, relatively small genome and multiple putative auxotrophies characteristic of Ca. U. copiosus suggest that it may be undergoing streamlining selection to minimize cellular architecture, a phenomenon previously thought to be restricted to aquatic bacteria. Although many soil bacteria need relatively large, complex genomes to be successful in soil, Ca. U. copiosus appears to use an alternative strategy, sacrificing metabolic versatility for efficiency to become dominant in the soil environment.","https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016198"

The endosymbiont fixes CO2 and thus generates organic carbon compounds, which support the host's growth. To investigate the uncultured symbiont's metabolism and symbiont-host interactions in detail we conducted a proteogenomic analysis of purified bacteria. Unexpectedly, our results reveal a hitherto completely unrecognized feature of the C. orbicularis symbiont's physiology: the symbiont's genome encodes all proteins necessary for biological nitrogen fixation (diazotrophy). Expression of the respective genes under standard ambient conditions was confirmed by proteomics. Nitrogenase activity in the symbiont was also verified by enzyme activity assays. Phylogenetic analysis of the bacterial nitrogenase reductase NifH revealed the symbiont's close relationship to free-living nitrogen-fixing Proteobacteria from the seagrass sediment. The C. orbicularis symbiont, here tentatively named 'Candidatus Thiodiazotropha endolucinida', may thus not only sustain the bivalve's carbon demands. C. orbicularis may also benefit from a steady supply of fixed nitrogen from its symbiont-a scenario that is unprecedented in comparable chemoautotrophic symbioses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016193"

We sequenced genomes of the chemosynthetic symbionts from the lucinid bivalve Loripes lucinalis and the stilbonematid nematode Laxus oneistus. The symbionts of both host species encoded nitrogen fixation genes. This is remarkable as no marine chemosynthetic symbiont was previously known to be capable of nitrogen fixation. We detected nitrogenase expression by the symbionts of lucinid clams at the transcriptomic and proteomic level. Mean stable nitrogen isotope values of Loripes lucinalis were within the range expected for fixed atmospheric nitrogen, further suggesting active nitrogen fixation by the symbionts. The ability to fix nitrogen may be widespread among chemosynthetic symbioses in oligotrophic habitats, where nitrogen availability often limits primary productivity.","https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016195"

We apply our methods to samples from four families with multiple cases of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Analysis of intra- and inter-individual variation demonstrates that family membership has a pronounced effect on the structural and functional composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome. In the context of T1DM, consistent taxonomic differences were absent across families, but certain human exocrine pancreatic proteins were found at lower levels. The associated microbial functional signatures were linked to metabolic traits in distinct taxa. The methodologies and results provide a foundation for future large-scale integrated multi-omic analyses of the gastrointestinal microbiome in the context of host-microbe interactions in human health and disease.","https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016180"

Here, we present the discovery of divergent methyl-coenzyme M reductase genes in population genomes recovered from anoxic environments with high methane flux that belong to a new archaeal phylum, the Verstraetearchaeota. These archaea encode the genes required for methylotrophic methanogenesis, and may conserve energy using a mechanism similar to that proposed for the obligate H2-dependent methylotrophic Methanomassiliicoccales and recently described Candidatus 'Methanofastidiosa'.

Attention has been paid to the economic benefits and environmental impacts of this process, yet the biogeochemical changes induced in the deep subsurface are poorly understood. Recent single-gene investigations revealed that halotolerant microbial communities were enriched after hydraulic fracturing. Here, the reconstruction of 31 unique genomes coupled to metabolite data from the Marcellus and Utica shales revealed that many of the persisting organisms play roles in methylamine cycling, ultimately supporting methanogenesis in the deep biosphere. Fermentation of injected chemical additives also sustains long-term microbial persistence, while thiosulfate reduction could produce sulfide, contributing to reservoir souring and infrastructure corrosion. Extensive links between viruses and microbial hosts demonstrate active viral predation, which may contribute to the release of labile cellular constituents into the extracellular environment. Our analyses show that hydraulic fracturing provides the organismal and chemical inputs for colonization and persistence in the deep terrestrial subsurface.","https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016146"

Moreover, reference strains of mouse gut bacteria are not easily available, although mouse models are extensively used in medical research. These are major limitations for the investigation of intestinal microbiomes and their interactions with diet and host. It is thus important to study in detail the diversity and functions of gut microbiota members, including those colonizing the mouse intestine. To address these issues, we aimed at establishing the Mouse Intestinal Bacterial Collection (miBC), a public repository of bacterial strains and associated genomes from the mouse gut, and studied host-specificity of colonization and sequence-based relevance of the resource. The collection includes several strains representing novel species, genera and even one family. Genomic analyses showed that certain species are specific to the mouse intestine and that a minimal consortium of 18 strains covered 50-75% of the known functional potential of metagenomes. The present work will sustain future research on microbiota-host interactions in health and disease, as it will facilitate targeted colonization and molecular studies. The resource is available at www.dsmz.de/miBC.","https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol2016131"
"nmicrobiol","A new view of the tree of life","The tree of life is one of the most important organizing principles in biology1. Gene surveys suggest the existence of an enormous number of branches2, but even an approximation of the full scale of the tree has remained elusive. Recent depictions of the tree of life have focused either on the nature of deep evolutionary relationships3-5 or on the known, well-classified diversity of life with an emphasis on eukaryotes6. These approaches overlook the dramatic change in our understanding of life's diversity resulting from genomic sampling of previously unexamined environments. New methods to generate genome sequences illuminate the identity of organisms and their metabolic capacities, placing them in community and ecosystem contexts7,8. Here, we use new genomic data from over 1,000 uncultivated and little known organisms, together with published sequences, to infer a dramatically expanded version of the tree of life, with Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya included. The depiction is both a global overview and a snapshot of the diversity within each major lineage. The results reveal the dominance of bacterial diversification and underline the importance of organisms lacking isolated representatives, with substantial evolution concentrated in a major radiation of such organisms. This tree highlights major lineages currently underrepresented in biogeochemical models and identifies radiations that are probably important for future evolutionary analyses.","https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol201648"
"nmicrobiol","Genomic inference of the metabolism of cosmopolitan subsurface Archaea, Hadesarchaea","The subsurface biosphere is largely unexplored and contains a broad diversity of uncultured microbes1. Despite being one of the few prokaryotic lineages that is cosmopolitan in both the terrestrial and marine subsurface2-4, the physiological and ecological roles of SAGMEG (South-African Gold Mine Miscellaneous Euryarchaeal Group) Archaea are unknown. Here, we report the metabolic capabilities of this enigmatic group as inferred from genomic reconstructions. Four high-quality (63-90% complete) genomes were obtained from White Oak River estuary and Yellowstone National Park hot spring sediment metagenomes. Phylogenomic analyses place SAGMEG Archaea as a deeply rooting sister clade of the Thermococci, leading us to propose the name Hadesarchaea for this new Archaeal class. With an estimated genome size of around 1.5 Mbp, the genomes of Hadesarchaea are distinctly streamlined, yet metabolically versatile. They share several physiological mechanisms with strict anaerobic Euryarchaeota. Several metabolic characteristics make them successful in the subsurface, including genes involved in CO and H2 oxidation (or H2 production), with potential coupling to nitrite reduction to ammonia (DNRA). This first glimpse into the metabolic capabilities of these cosmopolitan Archaea suggests they are mediating key geochemical processes and are specialized for survival in the subsurface biosphere.","https://www.nature.com/articles/nmicrobiol20162"
